 item 1 business 

company overview 

we are a leading american solar technology company and global provider of pv solar energy solutions developed at our rd labs in california and ohio we manufacture and sell pv solar modules with an advanced thin film semiconductor technology that provide a highperformance lowercarbon alternative to conventional crystalline silicon pv solar modules from raw material sourcing through endoflife module recycling we are committed to reducing the environmental impacts and enhancing the social and economic benefits of our products across their life cycle we are the world’s largest thin film pv solar module manufacturer and the largest pv solar module manufacturer in the western hemisphere 

in addressing the overall global demand for electricity our modules provide energy at a lower levelized cost of electricity “lcoe” meaning the net present value of a system’s total life cycle costs divided by the quantity of energy that is expected to be produced over the system’s life when compared to traditional forms of energy generation with over 1 billion in cumulative rd investments in the last 10 years alone we have a demonstrated history of innovation and continuous improvement we believe our strategies and points of differentiation provide the foundation for our competitive position and enable us to remain one of the preferred providers of pv solar modules 

business strategy 

advanced module technology 

our current module semiconductor structure is a singlejunction polycrystalline thin film that uses cdte as the absorption layer cdte has absorption properties that are well matched to the solar spectrum and can deliver competitive wattage using approximately 2 of the amount of semiconductor material used to manufacture conventional crystalline silicon modules in terms of performance in many climates our solar modules provide certain energy production advantages relative to competing crystalline silicon modules for example our cdte solar technology provides 

• a superior temperature coefficient which results in stronger system performance in typical high insolation climates as the majority of a system’s generation on average occurs when module temperatures are well above 25°c standard test conditions 

• a superior spectral response in humid environments where atmospheric moisture alters the solar spectrum relative to standard test conditions 

• a better partial shading response than competing crystalline silicon technologies which may experience significantly lower energy generation than cdte solar technologies when partial shading occurs and 

• an immunity to cell cracking and its resulting power output loss a common failure often observed in crystalline silicon modules caused by poor manufacturing handling weather or other conditions 

in addition to these technological advantages we also warrant that our pv solar modules will produce at least 98 of their labeled power output rating during the first year with the warranty coverage reducing by a degradation factor between 03 and 05 depending on the module series every year thereafter throughout the limited power output warranty period of up to 30 years following the implementation of our copper replacement “cure” program which replaces copper with certain other elements that are expected to enhance module performance we expect the warranted degradation of our modules to decline to 02 per year in the near term as a result of these and other factors our pv solar modules can produce more annual energy in real world operating conditions than conventional crystalline silicon modules with the same nameplate capacity for more information about the risks associated with our cure program see item 1a “risk factors – our failure to further refine our technology and 

develop and introduce improved pv products including as a result of delays in implementing planned advancements could render our solar modules uncompetitive and reduce our net sales profitability andor market share ” 

manufacturing process 

our modules combine our leadingedge cdte technology with the manufacturing excellence and quality control that comes from being the world’s most experienced producer of thin film pv solar modules with more than 40 gw dc of modules sold worldwide we have a demonstrated history of manufacturing success and innovation our global manufacturing footprint includes facilities in the united states malaysia and vietnam and we are expanding our global presence by constructing our first manufacturing facility in india which is expected to commence operations in the second half of 2023 our modules are manufactured in a highthroughput automated environment that integrates all manufacturing steps into a continuous flow line such process eliminates the multiple supply chain operators and resourceintensive batch processing steps that are used to produce crystalline silicon modules which typically occur over several days and across multiple factories at the outset of our module production a sheet of glass enters the production line and in a matter of hours is transformed into a completed module ready for shipment 

this proprietary production process includes the following three stages i the deposition stage ii the cell definition and treatment stage and iii the assembly and test stage in the deposition stage panels of transparent oxidecoated glass are robotically loaded onto the production line where they are cleaned lasermark identified with a serial number heated and coated with thin layers of cdte and other semiconductor materials using our vapor transport deposition technology after which the semiconductorcoated plates are cooled rapidly to increase glass strength in the cell definition and treatment stage we use highspeed lasers to transform the large continuous semiconductor coating on the glass plate into a series of interconnected cells that deliver the desired current and voltage output in this stage we also treat the semiconductor film using certain chemistries and processes to improve the device’s performance and apply a metal sputtered back contact in the assembly and test stage we apply busbars interlayer material and a rear glass cover sheet that is laminated to encapsulate the device we then apply antireflective coating material to the substrate glass to further improve the module’s performance by increasing its ability to absorb sunlight finally junction boxes termination wires and a frame are applied to complete the module assembly 

we maintain a robust quality and reliability assurance program that monitors critical process parameters and measures product performance to ensure that industry and more stringent internal standards are met we also conduct acceptance testing for electrical leakage visual quality and power measurement on a solar simulator prior to preparing a module for shipment our quality and reliability tests complement production surveillance with an ongoing monitoring program subjecting production modules to accelerated life stress testing to help ensure ongoing conformance to requirements of the international electrotechnical commission and underwriters laboratories inc these programs and tests help assure delivery of power and performance in the field with a high level of product quality and reliability 

research and development 

our rd model differentiates us from much of our competition due to its vertical integration from advanced research to product development manufacturing and applications we continue to devote substantial resources to our rd efforts which generally focus on continually improving the wattage and energy yield of our solar modules we also have rd programs to improve module durability and manufacturing efficiencies including throughput volume ramp and material cost reduction based on publicly available information we are one of the leaders in rd investment among pv solar module manufacturers maintaining a rate of innovation that enables continual wattage gains and cost reductions 

in the course of our rd activities we explore various technologies in our efforts to sustain competitive differentiation in our modules we primarily conduct our rd activities and qualify process and product improvements for full production at our perrysburg ohio plant and systematically propagate them to our other facilities we believe that our systematic approach to technology change management enables continuous improvements and ensures uniform adoption across our production lines in addition our production lines are replicas or near replicas of each other and as a result a process or production improvement on one line can be rapidly and reliably deployed to other production lines 

we regularly produce research cells in our laboratories some of which are tested for performance and certified by independent labs such as the national renewable energy laboratory cell efficiency measures the proportion of light converted to electricity in a single solar cell at standard test conditions our research cells are produced using laboratory equipment and methods and are not intended to be representative of our manufacturing capability our module conversion efficiency has improved on average more than half a percent every year for the last ten years we currently hold two world records for cdte pv cell efficiency achieving an independently certified research cell efficiency of 221 and a module aperture area efficiency of 197 we believe that our record cells demonstrate a potential midterm module efficiency entitlement of 25 in a multijunction application which is achievable using our commercialscale manufacturing equipment 

sustainability 

we are committed to reducing our carbon footprint and enhancing the social and economic benefits of our products our thin film modules are manufactured through an integrated process that uses less energy water and semiconductor material than conventional crystalline silicon modules accordingly our modules provide an ecologically leading solution to climate change energy security and water scarcity on a lifecycle basis our thin film module technology has the fastest energy payback time smallest carbon footprint and lowest water use of any competing pv solar technology 

the energy payback time of our module technology which is the amount of time a module must operate to recover the energy required to produce it is facilitated by our proprietary production process our module energy payback time is approximately four months which represents a 90fold energy return on investment over a theoretical 30year system lifetime and an abundant net energy gain to the electricity grid furthermore our modules have a carbon footprint that is 25 times lower and a water footprint that is three times lower than conventional crystalline silicon modules measured on a lifecycle basis that accounts for the energy and water used for the raw materials throughout our manufacturing process and during endoflife module recycling in addition our industryleading pv solar module recycling process further enhances our sustainability advantage by recovering approximately 90 of the glass for reuse in new glass products and over 90 of the semiconductor material for reuse in new modules we are the only pv solar module manufacturer with global inhouse recycling capabilities 

our series 6 tm “series 6” and series 6 plus tm “series 6 plus” modules are the world’s first and only pv products to be included in the electronic products environmental assessment tool “epeat” registry’s photovoltaic and inverters product category the epeat registry enables the identification of credible sustainable electronic products from a broad range of manufacturers based on several factors including the product’s raw materials manufacturing energy water use product packaging endoflife recycling and corporate responsibility we have also committed to the re100 campaign a collaborative global initiative of influential businesses committed to 100 renewable electricity in which we plan to utilize renewable sources to power our manufacturing operations by 2028 we expect this commitment to further reduce the carbon footprint of our modules by 40 further enabling our customers to achieve their sustainability objectives 

financial stability 

in addition to our sustainability commitments we are also committed to creating longterm shareholder value through a decisionmaking framework that delivers a balance of growth profitability and liquidity this framework has enabled us to fund our module manufacturing and capacity expansion initiatives primarily using cash flows generated by our operations despite substantial downward pressure on the price of solar modules due to competition demand fluctuations and significant overcapacity in the industry our financial stability provides strategic optionality as we evaluate how to invest in our business and generate returns for our shareholders our financial stability also enables us to offer meaningful warranties which provide us with a competitive advantage relative to many of our peers in the solar industry furthermore we expect our financial discipline and ability to manage operating costs to enhance our profitability as we continue to scale our business 

market overview 

solar energy is one of the fastest growing forms of renewable energy with numerous economic and environmental benefits that make it an attractive complement to andor substitute for traditional forms of energy generation in recent years the price of pv solar power systems and accordingly the cost of producing electricity from such systems has dropped to levels that are competitive with or below the wholesale price of electricity in many markets this rapid price decline has opened new possibilities to develop systems in many locations with limited or no financial incentives other technological developments in the industry such as the advancement of energy storage capabilities have further enhanced the prospects of solar energy as an alternative to traditional forms of energy generation furthermore the fact that a pv solar power system requires no fuel provides a unique and valuable hedging benefit to owners of such systems relative to other generation assets once installed pv solar power systems can function for over 35 years with relatively less maintenance or oversight compared to many other forms of generation in addition to these economic benefits solar energy has substantial environmental benefits for example pv solar power systems generate no greenhouse gas or other emissions and use minimal amounts of water compared to traditional energy generation assets worldwide solar markets continue to develop aided by the above factors as well as demand elasticity resulting from declining industry average selling prices both at the module and system level which have made solar power one of the most economically attractive sources of energy 

although module average selling prices in many global markets have declined for several years recent module spot pricing has increased in part due to elevated commodity and freight costs for example the price of polysilicon has significantly increased in recent months due to a coal shortage in china which resulted in higher energy prices and the chinese government mandating power restrictions that led to curtailments of silicon metal production given the majority of global polysilicon capacity is located in china such higher energy prices and reduced operating capacities have adversely affected the supply of polysilicon contributing to an increase in polysilicon pricing in response to such supply shortage certain other chinesebased producers of polysilicon are in the process of expanding their production capacity which is expected to reduce the price of polysilicon in future periods accordingly while the duration of this elevated period of spot pricing is uncertain module average selling prices in global markets are expected to decline in the longterm in the aggregate we believe manufacturers of solar cells and modules particularly those in china have significant installed production capacity relative to global demand and the ability for additional capacity expansion as a result we believe the solar industry may experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity exceeds global demand and that excess capacity will put pressure on pricing additionally intense competition at the system level may result in an environment in which pricing falls rapidly thereby potentially increasing demand for solar energy solutions but constraining the ability for project developers and module manufacturers to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability in light of such market realities we continue to focus on our strategies and points of differentiation which include our advanced module technology our manufacturing process our research and development capabilities the sustainability advantage of our modules and our financial stability 

global markets 

we have established and continue to develop a global business presence energy markets are by their nature localized with different drivers and market forces impacting electricity generation and demand in a particular region or for a particular application accordingly our business is evolving worldwide and is shaped by the varying ways in which our modules can provide compelling and economically viable solutions to energy needs in various markets we are currently focusing on markets including those listed below in which our cdte solar modules provide certain advantages over conventional crystalline silicon solar modules including high insolation climates in which our modules provide a superior temperature coefficient humid environments in which our modules provide a superior spectral response and markets that favor the superior sustainability profile of our pv solar technology to the extent our production capacity expands in future periods we have the potential to extend our focus to additional geographic markets 

united states multiple markets within the united states which accounted for 84 of our 2021 net sales exemplify favorable characteristics for a solar market including i sizeable electricity demand particularly around growing population centers and industrial areas ii strong demand for renewable energy generation and iii abundant solar resources in those areas and applications in which these factors are more pronounced our pv solar modules compete favorably on an economic basis with traditional forms of energy generation the market penetration of pv solar is also impacted by certain federal and state support programs including the federal investment tax credit as described below under “support programs” as a result of such market opportunities we recently announced plans to expand our manufacturing capacity by 33 gw dc by constructing our third us manufacturing facility which is expected to commence operations in the first half of 2023 upon completion of this facility which commenced construction in late 2021 we expect our us manufacturing capacity to be approximately 6 gw dc  

india india continues to represent one of the largest and fastest growing markets for pv solar energy with an installed generation capacity of approximately 45 gw ac  approximately 45 gw ac of projects under various stages of construction and over 20 gw ac of new projects being contracted under active procurement programs in addition the government has established aggressive renewable energy targets which include increasing the country’s overall renewable energy capacity to 500 gw ac by 2030 and establishing a netzero carbon emissions target by 2070 based on these targets it is projected that the solar energy generation capacity will be 300 gw ac by 2030 the government has also announced a series of policy and regulatory measures to incentivize domestic manufacturing of pv solar modules as described below under “support programs” these targets policies and regulatory measures are expected to help create significant and sustained demand for pv solar energy in addition to these factors our cdte solar technology is well suited for the india market given its hot and humid climate conditions as a result of such market opportunities we recently announced plans to expand our manufacturing capacity by an additional 33 gw dc by constructing our first manufacturing facility in india which is expected to commence operations in the second half of 2023 such expansion builds upon our existing presence of approximately 2 gw dc of modules sold in india 

europe  most markets across europe reflect strong demand for pv solar energy due to its ability to compete economically with more traditional forms of energy generation during 2021 european union “eu” member states added a combined 26 gw dc of solar capacity representing the largest annual solar deployment in the region in the last 10 years such expansion which was primarily driven by solar capacity additions in germany spain the netherlands poland and france brings the region’s installed generation capacity to approximately 165 gw dc  we continue to pursue module sales activities in many of the countries mentioned above 

japan japan’s electricity markets have various characteristics that make them attractive for pv solar energy investments in particular japan has few domestic fossil fuel resources and relies heavily on fossil fuel imports following the fukushima earthquake in 2011 the country introduced certain initiatives to limit its reliance on nuclear power accordingly the japanese government announced a longterm goal of dramatically increasing installed solar power capacity and provided various incentives for solar power installations in recent years we have partnered with local companies to develop construct sell and operate various pv solar power systems which are 

expected to mitigate japan’s dependence on fossil fuel imports and nuclear power in 2021 we completed the sale of multiple projects in japan totaling 51 mw ac  in late 2021 we received an offer to purchase our project development and om services businesses in japan and determined it was in the best interest of our stockholders to pursue this transaction as a result we expect to enter into an agreement for the sale of these businesses in the near term the completion of the transaction is contingent on the completion of final contract negotiations and the achievement of certain closing conditions assuming satisfaction of such items we expect the sale to be completed in the first half of 2022 following the sale of these businesses we plan to continue pursuing module sales opportunities in japan 

support programs 

although we compete in many markets that do not require solarspecific government subsidies or support programs our net sales and profits remain subject in the near term to variability based on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives such as quotas renewable portfolio standards and tendering systems in addition to these support programs financial incentives for pv solar energy may include tax and production incentives additionally many governments have proposed or implemented policies or support programs intended to stimulate their respective economies such support programs may include additional incentives for renewable energy projects including pv solar power systems over several years although we expect to become less impacted by and less dependent on these forms of government support over time such programs continue to influence the demand for pv solar energy around the world 

in the united states tax incentive programs exist at both the federal and state levels and can take the form of investment and production tax credits accelerated depreciation and sales and property tax exemptions and abatements at the federal level investment tax credits for business and residential solar systems have gone through several cycles of enactment and expiration since the 1980s the current federal energy investment tax credit “itc” for both residential and commercial solar installations requires projects to have commenced construction by a certain date which may be achieved by certain qualifying procurement activities in 2020 the us congress extended the 26 itc through 2022 as part of its covid19 relief efforts such credit is currently scheduled to step down to 22 for projects that commence construction in 2023 and 10 for projects that commence construction thereafter during 2021 legislation was introduced in the us congress to incentivize domestic solar manufacturing and accelerate the transition to clean energy by providing tax credits for us solar manufacturers and project developers among other things such proposed legislation extends the itc up to 40 for 10 years for solar projects that satisfy certain domestic content labor and wage requirements introduces certain refundable tax credits for solar module components manufactured in the us revives certain tax credits for capital investments in the manufacturing of solar module components and expands the scope of production tax credits for energy storage projects at this time it is unclear whether and to what extent such measures will be enacted into law the itc has been an important economic driver of solar installations and qualifying procurement activities in the united states and its extension is expected to contribute to greater mediumterm demand the positive impact of the itc depends to a large degree on the availability of tax equity for project financing and any significant reduction in the availability of tax equity in the future could make it more difficult to develop and construct projects requiring financing 

the majority of states in the united states have also enacted legislation adopting renewable portfolio standard “rps” mechanisms under an rps regulated utilities and other load serving entities are required to procure a specified percentage of their total retail electricity sales to enduser customers from eligible renewable resources such as solar energy generation facilities by a specified date for example california’s rps program which is one of the most significant in the united states in terms of the volume of renewable electricity required to meet its rps mandate currently requires utilities and other obligated load serving entities to procure 60 of their total retail electricity demand from eligible renewable resources by 2030 and 100 of such electricity demand from carbonfree resources by 2045 some programs may further require that a specified portion of the total percentage of renewable energy must come from solar generation facilities or other technologies rps mechanisms and other legislation vary significantly from state to state particularly with respect to the percentage of renewable energy required to achieve the state’s rps the definition of eligible renewable energy resources and the extent to which renewable energy credits qualify for rps compliance 

in india incentives at both the federal and state levels have contributed to growth in domestic pv solar module manufacturing for example in 2019 the government announced a concessional corporate income tax rate of 15 for new manufacturing investments and in early 2021 the government approved a production linked incentive “pli” scheme of inr 45 billion 06 billion for pv solar cells and modules manufactured in india in early 2022 the government announced an expansion to the pli scheme to inr 195 billion 26 billion under the pli scheme manufacturers are selected through a competitive bid process and receive the incentive over a fiveyear period following the commissioning of their manufacturing facilities such incentives may be increased for higher efficiency modules and raw materials sourced from the domestic market additionally the indian government has also announced import duty tariffs of 40 on solar modules and 25 on solar cells beginning in april 2022 a regulation mandating that any solar project with federal utility state utility or commercial and industrial offtakers that interconnects through government owned transmission lines only use solar modules from an approved list of module manufacturers and a requirement that all federal procurement of solar modules be only from cells and modules produced domestically 

in europe renewable energy targets in conjunction with tenders for utilityscale pv solar and other support measures have contributed to growth in pv solar markets renewable energy targets prescribe how much energy consumption must come from renewable sources while incentive policies and competitive tender policies are intended to support new supply development by providing certainty to investors various eu directives on renewable energy have set targets for all eu member states in support of the goal of a 55 share of energy from renewable sources in the eu by 2030 in addition to these targets certain markets in europe such as france have adopted regulations for public tenders of renewable energy to prioritize pv solar power systems that utilize solar modules produced in lowcarbon manufacturing processes such regulations require developers to provide information about the carbon footprint of pv solar modules used in their utilityscale projects and precludes the use of module technology that does not meet certain minimum carbon footprint thresholds 

various proposed and contemplated environmental and tax policies may create regulatory uncertainty in the renewable energy sector including the solar energy sector and may lead to a reduction or removal of various clean energy programs and initiatives designed to curtail climate change for more information about the risks associated with these potential government actions see item 1a “risk factors – the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives tax incentives renewable energy targets and other support for ongrid solar electricity applications or other public policies such as tariffs or other trade remedies imposed on solar cells and modules could negatively impact demand andor price levels for our solar modules and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales or increase our costs thereby adversely impacting our operating results” 

business segments 

modules business 

our primary segment is our modules business which involves the design manufacture and sale of cdte solar modules which convert sunlight into electricity since the inception of first solar our flagship module has used our advanced thin film semiconductor technology each of our currently produced modules is a glass laminate approximately 4ft x 6ft in size that encapsulates thin film semiconductor materials at the end of 2021 our modules had an average power output of 455 watts 

raw materials 

our module manufacturing process uses approximately 30 types of raw materials and components to construct a solar module including cdte front glass coated with transparent conductive oxide other semiconductor materials organics such as photo resist tempered back glass frames packaging components such as interlayer cord platecord plate cap lead wire and solar connectors before we use these materials and components in our manufacturing process a supplier must undergo rigorous qualification procedures and we continually evaluate new suppliers as part of our cost reduction roadmap when possible we attempt to use suppliers that can provide a raw material 

supply source that is near our manufacturing locations reducing the cost and lead times for such materials several of our key raw materials and components are either singlesourced or sourced from a limited number of suppliers 

customers 

our customers include developers and operators of systems utilities independent power producers commercial and industrial companies and other system owners during 2021 our thirdparty module sales represented approximately 80 of our total net sales and we sold the majority of our solar modules to developers and operators of systems in the united states during 2021 sb energy accounted for more than 10 of our modules business net sales 

we continue to focus on certain key geographic markets particularly in areas with abundant solar resources and sizable electricity demand and additional customer relationships to diversify our customer base the wholesale commercial and industrial market continues to represent a promising opportunity for the widespread adoption of pv solar technology as corporations undertake certain sustainability commitments the demand for corporate renewables continues to accelerate with corporations worldwide committing to the re100 campaign we believe we also have a competitive advantage in the commercial and industrial market due to many customers’ sensitivity to the sustainability experience and financial stability of their suppliers and geographically diverse operating locations with our sustainability advantage financial strength and global footprint we are well positioned to meet these needs 

additionally the increase of utilityowned generation has expanded the number of potential buyers of our modules as such utility customers benefit from a potentially low cost of capital available through ratebased utility investments given their longterm ownership profile utilityowned generation customers typically seek to partner with stable companies that can provide lowcost alternatives to or replacements for aging fossil fuelbased generation resources including reliable pv solar technology thereby mitigating their longterm ownership risks 

competition 

the solar energy and renewable energy sectors are highly competitive and continually evolving as participants in these sectors strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete within the larger electric power industry among pv solar module manufacturers the principal method of competition is sales price per watt which may be influenced by several module value attributes including wattage through a larger form factor or an improved conversion efficiency energy yield degradation sustainability reliability warranty terms and customer payment terms we face intense competition for sales of solar modules which may result in reduced selling prices and loss of market share our primary source of competition is crystalline silicon module manufacturers the majority of which are linked to china in addition we expect to compete with future entrants into the pv solar industry and existing market participants that offer new or differentiated technological solutions for example while conventional solar modules including the solar modules we currently produce are monofacial meaning their ability to produce energy is a function of direct and diffuse irradiance on their front side most module manufacturers offer bifacial modules that also capture diffuse irradiance and reflected light on the back side of a module additionally certain module manufacturers recently introduced ntype monocrystalline modules such as tunnel oxide passivated contact “topcon” modules ntype solar cells are expected to provide certain improvements to module efficiency temperature coefficient and bifacial performance and claim to provide certain degradation advantages compared to other monocrystalline modules for additional information see item 1a “risk factors – our failure to further refine our technology and develop and introduce improved pv products including as a result of delays in implementing planned advancements could render our solar modules uncompetitive and reduce our net sales profitability andor market share” 

certain of our existing or future competitors including many linked to china may have direct or indirect access to sovereign capital which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time our results of operations could be adversely affected if competitors reduce module pricing to levels below their costs bid aggressively low prices for module sale agreements or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time we believe the solar industry may from time to time experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity exceeds global demand and that excess capacity will also put pressure on pricing which could adversely affect our results of operations for additional information see item 1a “risk factors – competition in solar markets globally and across the solar value chain is intense and could remain that way for an extended period of time an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations” 

solar module warranties 

we provide a limited pv solar module warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for up to 12 years we also typically warrant that modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 98 of their labeled power output rating during the first year with the warranty coverage reducing by a degradation factor every year thereafter throughout the limited power output warranty period of up to 30 years among other things our solar module warranty also covers the resulting power output loss from cell cracking for additional information on our solar module warranty programs refer to item 1a “risk factors – problems with product quality or performance may cause us to incur significant andor unexpected contractual damages andor warranty and related expenses damage our market reputation and prevent us from maintaining or increasing our market share” 

solar module collection and recycling 

in addition to our module warranty commitments we are also committed to extended producer responsibility and take into account the environmental impact of our products over their entire life cycle as part of such efforts we previously established the solar industry’s first global comprehensive module collection and recycling program our module recycling process is designed to maximize the recovery of materials including the glass and encapsulated semiconductor material for use in new modules or other products and enhances the sustainability profile of our modules approximately 90 of each collected first solar module can be recycled into materials for reuse for certain legacy customer sales contracts that were covered under this program which has since been discontinued we agreed to pay the costs for the collection and recycling of qualifying solar modules and the end users agreed to notify us disassemble their solar power systems package the solar modules for shipment and revert ownership rights over the modules back to us at the end of the modules’ service lives we currently have recycling facilities operating at each of our manufacturing facilities in the united states malaysia and vietnam and at our former manufacturing facility location in germany 

for modules covered under our program that were previously sold into and installed in the eu we continue to maintain a commitment to cover the estimated collection and recycling costs consistent with our historical program the eu’s waste electrical and electronic equipment “weee” directive places the obligation of recycling including collection treatment and environmentally sound disposal of electrical and electronic equipment products upon producers and is applicable to all pv solar modules in eu member states as a result of the transposition of the weee directive by the eu member states we have adjusted our recycling offerings as required in various eu member states to ensure compliance with specific eu member state weee regulations 

other 

our residual business operations include certain project development activities and om services which are primarily concentrated in japan as well as the results of operations from pv solar power systems we own and operate in certain international regions in late 2021 we received an offer to purchase our project development and om services businesses in japan and determined it was in the best interest of our stockholders to pursue this transaction as a result we expect to enter into an agreement for the sale of these businesses in the near term the completion of the transaction is contingent on the completion of final contract negotiations and the achievement of certain closing conditions assuming satisfaction of such items we expect the sale to be completed in the first half of 2022 

intellectual property 

our success depends in part on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technology and to conduct our business without infringing on the proprietary rights of others we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks and trade secrets as well as associate and thirdparty confidentiality agreements to safeguard our intellectual property we regularly file patent applications to protect inventions arising from our rd activities and are currently pursuing patent applications in the united states and other countries our patent applications and any future patent applications may not result in a patent being issued with the scope of the claims we seek or at all and any patents we may receive may be challenged invalidated or declared unenforceable in addition we have registered andor have applied to register trademarks and service marks in the united states and a number of foreign countries for “first solar” 

with respect to proprietary knowhow that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce we rely on among other things trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests we believe that many elements of our pv solar module manufacturing processes including our unique materials sourcing involve proprietary knowhow technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications including technical processes equipment designs algorithms and procedures we have taken security measures to protect these elements our rd personnel have entered into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us these agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our associates to assign to us all of the inventions designs and technologies they develop during the course of their employment with us we also require our customers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose sensitive aspects of our modules technology or business plans we have not been subject to any material intellectual property infringement or misappropriation claims 

regulatory environmental health and safety matters 

we are subject to various federal state local and international laws and regulations and are often subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with national and local ordinances relating to building codes safety and other matters we are also subject to regulatory oversight and liability if we fail to operate our pv solar power systems in compliance with applicable renewable energy law electric business law and project permits and approvals the impact of these laws and requirements may increase our overall costs and may delay prevent or increase the cost of manufacturing pv modules as we operate in the us and internationally we are also subject to the application of us trade laws and trade laws of other countries such tariffs and policies or any other us or global trade remedies or other trade barriers that apply to us given our global operations may directly or indirectly affect our business financial condition and results of operations see item 1a “risk factors – existing regulations and policies changes thereto and new regulations and policies may present technical regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of pv solar products which may significantly reduce demand for our modules” 

we are also subject to the application of various antibribery laws some of which prohibit improper payments to government and nongovernment persons and entities and others eg the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” and the uk bribery act that extend their application to activities outside their country of origin from time to time we may compete against companies for contracts in china india south america and the middle east which require substantial government contact and where norms can differ from us standards and not all competitors are subject to compliance with the same antibribery laws see item 1a risk factors – “we could be adversely affected by any violations of the fcpa the uk bribery act and other foreign antibribery laws” 

we are also subject to various federal state local and international laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the use management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes occupational health and safety and the cleanup of contaminated sites our operations include the use handling storage transportation generation and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes therefore we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions and costs arising from thirdparty property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations or noncompliance with environmental permits required for our operations we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety requirements and do not expect to incur material expenditures for environmental and occupational health and safety controls in the foreseeable future however future developments such as the implementation of new more stringent laws and regulations more aggressive enforcement policies or the discovery of unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see item 1a “risk factors – environmental obligations and liabilities could have a substantial negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations” 

from time to time we may also be subject to government policies or laws intended to protect human rights for example in late 2021 the us president signed the uyghur forced labor prevention act which bans the import of goods from china’s xinjiang region into the united states due to concerns about forced labor practices in the region which provides approximately half of the world’s polysilicon supply while we do not use polysilicon in our solar modules which mitigates the potential supply chain disruptions and human rights risks associated with such import ban the implementation of similar restrictions or trade embargoes on the purchase of certain materials or equipment necessary to sustain our manufacturing operations may require expenditures and process changes to ensure our supply chain remains free of such materials which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations we are committed to protecting human rights enforcing fair labor practices and addressing the potential risks of forced labor across our own operations and the operations of our suppliers 

human capital

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the following information together with the other information in this annual report on form 10k before buying shares of our stock if any of the following risks or uncertainties occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our stock could decline 

summary of risk factors 

the following is a summary of the principal risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and make an investment in our stock speculative or risky you should read this summary together with the more detailed description of each risk factor contained below 

risks related to our markets and customers 

• competition in solar markets globally and across the solar value chain is intense and could remain that way for an extended period of time an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand if our competitors reduce module pricing to levels near or below their manufacturing costs or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time or if demand for pv modules does not grow sufficiently to justify the current production supply our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

• pv solar and related technologies may not be suitable for continued adoption at economically attractive rates of return sufficient additional demand for solar modules and related technologies may not develop or may take longer to develop than we anticipate causing our net sales and profit to flatten or decline and threatening our ability to sustain profitability 

• the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives tax incentives renewable energy targets and other support for ongrid solar electricity applications or other public policies could negatively impact demand andor price levels for our solar modules the imposition of tariffs on our products could materially increase our costs to perform under our contracts with customers which could adversely affect our results of operations 

• an increase in interest rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets including a reduction in total tax equity availability could make it difficult for customers to finance the cost of a pv solar power system and could reduce the demand for our modules andor lead to a reduction in the average selling price for our products 

risks related to our operations manufacturing and technology 

• we face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules if global supply exceeds global demand it could lead to a further reduction in the average selling price for pv solar modules which could reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations 

• problems with product quality or performance may cause us to incur significant andor unexpected contractual damages andor warranty and related expenses damage our market reputation and prevent us from maintaining or increasing our market share 

• our failure to further refine our technology and develop and introduce improved pv products including as a result of delays in implementing planned advancements could render our solar modules uncompetitive and reduce our net sales profitability andor market share 

• several of our key raw materials components particularly cdte and manufacturing equipment are either singlesourced or sourced from a limited number of suppliers and their failure to perform could cause manufacturing delays and impair our ability to deliver solar modules to customers in the required quality and quantities and at a price that is profitable to us 

• our failure to reduce module manufacturing production and selling costs including costs related to raw materials and logistics services could render our solar modules uncompetitive and reduce our net sales profitability andor market share 

risks related to regulations 

• existing regulations and policies changes thereto and new regulations and policies may present technical regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of pv solar products or systems which may significantly reduce demand for our modules 

general risk factors 

• the covid19 pandemic could materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

• if our longlived assets or project related assets become impaired we may be required to record significant charges to earnings 

risks related to our markets and customers 

competition in solar markets globally and across the solar value chain is intense and could remain that way for an extended period of time an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the aggregate we believe manufacturers of solar cells and modules have significant installed production capacity relative to global demand and the ability for additional capacity expansion for example we estimate that in 2021 approximately 80 gw dc of capacity was added by solar module manufacturers primarily but not exclusively in asia we believe the solar industry may from time to time experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity exceeds global demand and that excess capacity will continue to put pressure on pricing during the past several years industry average selling prices per watt have generally declined in many markets at times significantly as competitors have reduced prices to sell inventories worldwide there may be additional pressure on global demand and average selling prices in the future resulting from fluctuating demand in certain major solar markets such as china if our competitors reduce module pricing to levels near or below their manufacturing costs or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time or if demand for pv modules does not grow sufficiently to justify the current production supply our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

if pv solar and related technologies are not suitable for continued adoption at economically attractive rates of return or if sufficient additional demand for solar modules and related technologies does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate our net sales and profit may flatten or decline and we may be unable to sustain profitability 

in comparison to traditional forms of energy generation the solar energy market continues to be at an earlier stage of development if utilityscale pv solar technology proves unsuitable for continued adoption at economically attractive rates of return or if additional demand for solar modules fails to develop sufficiently or takes longer to develop than we anticipate we may be unable to grow our business or generate sufficient net sales to sustain 

profitability in addition demand for solar modules and related technologies in our targeted markets may develop to a lesser extent than we anticipate many factors may affect the viability of continued adoption of utilityscale pv solar technology in our targeted markets as well as the demand for solar modules generally including the following 

• costeffectiveness of the electricity generated by pv solar power systems compared to conventional energy sources such as natural gas which fuel source may be subject to significant price fluctuations from time to time and other renewable energy sources such as wind geothermal and hydroelectric 

• changes in tax trade remedies and other public policy as well as changes in economic market and other conditions that affect the price of and demand for conventional energy resources nonsolar renewable energy resources eg wind and hydroelectric and energy efficiency programs and products including increases or decreases in the prices of natural gas coal oil and other fossil fuels and in the prices of competing renewable resources 

• the extent of competition barriers to entry and overall conditions and timing related to the development of solar in new and emerging market segments such as commercial and industrial customers community solar community choice aggregators and other customer segments 

• availability substance and magnitude of support programs including federal state and local government subsidies incentives targets and renewable portfolio standards among other policies and programs to accelerate the development of the solar industry 

• performance reliability and availability of energy generated by pv solar power systems compared to conventional and other nonsolar renewable energy sources and products particularly conventional energy generation capable of providing 24hour nonintermittent baseload power 

• the development functionality scale cost and timing of energy storage solutions and 

• changes in the amount and priorities of capital expenditures by end users of solar modules and systems eg utilities which capital expenditures tend to decrease when the economy slows or when interest rates increase thereby resulting in redirection away from solar generation to development of competing forms of electric generation and to distribution eg smart grid transmission and energy efficiency measures 

the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives tax incentives renewable energy targets and other support for ongrid solar electricity applications or other public policies such as tariffs or other trade remedies imposed on solar cells and modules could negatively impact demand andor price levels for our solar modules and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales or increase our costs thereby adversely impacting our operating results 

although we believe that solar energy will experience widespread adoption in those applications where it competes economically with traditional forms of energy without any support programs in certain markets our net sales and profits remain subject to variability based on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives federal state and local governmental bodies in many countries have provided subsidies in the form of feedintariff “fit” structures rebates tax incentives and other incentives to end users distributors system integrators and manufacturers of pv solar products many of these support programs expire phase out over time require renewal by the applicable authority or may be amended a summary of certain recent developments in the major government support programs that may impact our business appears under item 1 “business – support programs” to the extent these support programs are reduced earlier than previously expected are changed retroactively or are not renewed such changes could negatively impact demand andor price levels for our solar modules lead to a reduction in our net sales and adversely impact our operating results another consideration in the us market and to a lesser extent in other global markets is the effect of governmental landuse planning policies and environmental policies on utilityscale pv solar development the adoption of restrictive landuse 

designations or environmental regulations that proscribe or restrict the siting of utilityscale solar facilities could adversely affect the marginal cost of such development 

changes or threatened changes in us regulatory policy may subject us to significant risks including the following 

• a reduction or removal of clean energy programs and initiatives and the incentives they provide may diminish the market for future solar energy offtake agreements slow the retirement of aging fossil fuel plants including the retirements of coal generation plants and reduce the ability for solar project developers to compete for offtake agreements which may reduce pv solar module sales 

• any limitations on the value or availability to potential investors of tax incentives that benefit solar energy projects such as the itc which is currently scheduled to decrease to 22 in 2023 and 10 in 2024 and accelerated depreciation deductions could result in reducing such investors’ economic returns causing a reduction in the availability of affordable financing thereby reducing demand for pv solar modules and 

• any effort to overturn federal and state laws regulations or policies that are supportive of solar energy generation or that remove costs or other limitations on other types of electricity generation that compete with solar energy projects could negatively impact our ability to compete with traditional forms of electricity generation and materially and adversely affect our business 

application of us trade laws or trade laws of other countries may also impact either directly or indirectly our operating results in some instances the application of trade laws is currently beneficial to the company and changes in their application could have an adverse impact 

for example the united states currently imposes different types of tariffs andor other trade remedies on certain imported crystalline silicon pv modules and cells from various countries during 2021 these tariffs included a global safeguard measure imposed pursuant to section 201 of the trade act of 1974 that provided for tariffs on imported crystalline silicon solar modules and a tariffrate quota on imported crystalline silicon solar cells above the first 25 gw dc of imports thin film solar cell products such as our cdte technology are specifically excluded from the tariffs the positive impact of this measure on our operating results has been reduced by various actions taken by the us government first in june 2019 the office of the us trade representative granted a tariff exclusion for imports of bifacial modules in october 2020 the us president withdrew the exclusion and adjusted the tariff rate from 15 to 18 between february 2021 and february 2022 but the us court of international trade enjoined enforcement of those actions in november 2021 second in february 2022 the us president proclaimed a fouryear extension of the current global safeguard measure but this extension measure does not apply tariffs to imports of bifacial modules the extension measure imposes a 1475 tariff in the first year which is scheduled to phase down annually in 025 percentage point increments over the fouryear term the extension measure also increased the annual tariffrate quota threshold so that tariffs apply to imported crystalline silicon solar cells above the first 50 gw dc of imports 

in addition the united states currently imposes antidumping and countervailing duties on certain imported crystalline silicon pv cells and modules from china and taiwan such antidumping and countervailing duties can change over time pursuant to annual reviews conducted by the us department of commerce and a decline in duty rates could have an adverse impact on our operating results in february 2022 auxin solar inc a us producer of crystalline silicon pv products petitioned the us department of commerce “usdoc” to investigate alleged circumvention of antidumping and countervailing duties on chinese imports by crystalline silicon pv cells and module imports assembled and completed in cambodia malaysia thailand and vietnam we cannot predict what actions usdoc will take with respect to that petition our operating results could be adversely impacted if usdoc declines to investigate or makes negative circumvention determinations conversely affirmative circumvention determinations could positively impact our operating results 

in other instances the application of us trade laws has had or could have an adverse impact on our operating results by increasing our costs or limiting the competitiveness of our products for example the united states imposes tariffs on certain imported aluminum and steel articles from certain foreign jurisdictions generally at rates of 10 and 25 respectively under section 232 of the trade expansion act of 1962 such tariffs and policies or any other us or global trade remedies or other trade barriers may directly or indirectly affect us or global markets for solar energy and our business financial condition and results of operations these examples show that established markets for pv solar development face uncertainties arising from policy regulatory and governmental constraints while the expected potential of the markets we are targeting is significant policy promulgation and market development are especially vulnerable to governmental inertia political instability the imposition or lowering of trade remedies and other trade barriers geopolitical risk fossil fuel subsidization potentially stringent localization requirements and limited available infrastructure 

an increase in interest rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets including a reduction in total tax equity availability could make it difficult for customers to finance the cost of a pv solar power system and could reduce the demand for our modules andor lead to a reduction in the average selling price for our modules 

many of our customers depend on debt andor equity financing to fund the initial capital expenditure required to develop build andor purchase a pv solar power system as a result an increase in interest rates or a reduction in the supply of project debt financing or tax equity investments could reduce the number of solar projects that receive financing or otherwise make it difficult for our customers to secure the financing necessary to develop build purchase or install a pv solar power system on favorable terms or at all and thus lower demand for our solar modules which could limit our growth or reduce our net sales see the risk factor entitled “the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives tax incentives renewable energy targets and other support for ongrid solar electricity applications or other public policies such as tariffs or other trade remedies imposed on solar cells and modules could negatively impact demand andor price levels for our solar modules and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales or increase our costs thereby adversely impacting our operating results” for additional information in addition we believe that a significant percentage of our customers install systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt an increase in interest rates could lower an investor’s return on investment in a system increase equity return requirements or make alternative investments more attractive relative to pv solar power systems and in each case could cause these customers to seek alternative investments 

we may be unable to fully execute on our longterm strategic plans which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we face numerous difficulties in executing on our longterm strategic plans particularly in new foreign jurisdictions including the following 

• difficulty in competing against companies who may have greater financial resources andor a more effective or established localized business presence andor an ability to operate with minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time 

• difficulty in competing successfully with other technologies such as bifacial modules and ntype monocrystalline modules 

• difficulty in accurately prioritizing geographic markets that we can most effectively and profitably serve with our solar module offerings including miscalculations in overestimating or underestimating addressable market demand 

• adverse public policies in countries we operate in andor are pursuing including local content requirements the imposition of trade remedies the removal of trade barriers or capital investment requirements 

• business climates such as that in china that may have the effect of putting foreign companies at a disadvantage relative to domestic companies 

• unstable economic social andor operating environments in foreign jurisdictions including social unrest currency inflation and interest rate uncertainties 

• the possibility of applying an ineffective commercial approach to targeted markets including product offerings that may not meet market needs 

• difficulty in generating sufficient sales volumes at economically sustainable profitability levels 

• difficulty in timely identifying attracting training and retaining qualified sales technical and other personnel in geographies targeted for expansion 

• difficulty in maintaining proper controls and procedures as we expand our business operations in terms of geographical reach including transitioning certain business functions to lowcost geographies with any material control failure potentially leading to reputational damage and loss of confidence in our financial reporting 

• difficulty in competing successfully for market share in overall solar markets as a result of the success of companies participating in the global rooftop pv solar market which is a segment in which we do not have significant historical experience 

• difficulty in establishing and implementing a commercial and operational approach adequate to address the specific needs of the markets we are pursuing 

• difficulty in identifying effective local partners and developing any necessary partnerships with local businesses on commercially acceptable terms and 

• difficulty in balancing market demand and manufacturing production in an efficient and timely manner potentially causing our manufacturing capacity to be constrained in some future periods or oversupplied in others 

refer also to the risk factors entitled “our substantial international operations subject us to a number of risks including unfavorable political regulatory labor and tax conditions in the united states andor foreign countries” and “the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives tax incentives renewable energy targets and other support for ongrid solar electricity applications or other public policies such as tariffs or other trade remedies imposed on solar cells and modules could negatively impact demand andor price levels for our solar modules and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales or increase our costs thereby adversely impacting our operating results” 

the loss of any of our large customers or the inability of our customers and counterparties to perform under their contracts with us could significantly reduce our net sales and negatively impact our results of operations 

our customers include developers and operators of systems utilities independent power producers commercial and industrial companies and other system owners who may experience intense competition at the system level thereby constraining the ability for such customers to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability the loss of any of our large customers their inability to perform under their contracts or their default in payment could significantly reduce our net sales andor adversely impact our operating results while our contracts with customers typically have certain firm purchase commitments and may include provisions for the payment of amounts to us in certain events of contract termination these contracts may be subject to amendments made by us or requested by our customers these amendments may reduce the volume of modules to be sold under the contract adjust delivery 

schedules or otherwise decrease the expected revenue under these contracts although we believe that we can mitigate this risk in part by reallocating modules to other customers if the need arises we may be unable in whole or in part to do so on similar terms or at all we may also mitigate this risk by requiring some form of payment security from our customers such as parent guarantees bank guarantees surety bonds or commercial letters of credit however in the event the providers of such payment security fail to perform their obligations our operating results could be adversely impacted 

we may be unable to profitably provide new solar offerings or achieve sufficient market penetration with such offerings 

we may expand our portfolio of offerings to include solutions that build upon our core competencies but for which we have not had significant historical experience including variations in our traditional product offerings or other offerings related to certain markets we cannot be certain that we will be able to ascertain and allocate the appropriate financial and human resources necessary to grow these business areas we could invest capital into growing these businesses but fail to address market or customer needs or otherwise not experience a satisfactory level of financial return in expanding into these areas we may also compete against companies that previously have not been significant competitors such as companies that currently have substantially more experience than we do in the residential commercial and industrial or other targeted offerings if we are unable to achieve growth in these areas our overall growth and financial performance may be limited relative to our competitors and our operating results could be adversely impacted 

risks related to our operations manufacturing and technology 

we face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules if global supply exceeds global demand it could lead to a further reduction in the average selling price for pv solar modules  which could reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations 

the solar and renewable energy industries are highly competitive and are continually evolving as participants strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete with the larger electric power industry within the global pv solar industry we face intense competition from crystalline silicon module manufacturers existing or future module manufacturers might be acquired by larger companies with significant capital resources thereby further intensifying competition with us in addition the introduction of a low cost disruptive technology could adversely affect our ability to compete which could reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations 

we expect to compete with future entrants into the pv solar industry and existing market participants that offer new or differentiated technological solutions for example most crystalline silicon cell and wafer manufacturers have transitioned from lower efficiency back surface field “bsf” multicrystalline cells the legacy technology against which we have generally competed to higher efficiency passivated emitter rear contact “perc” monocrystalline cells at competitive cost structures as a result we expect that in the near future our primary competition will be monocrystalline perc based modules with higher conversion efficiencies additionally while conventional solar modules including the solar modules we currently produce are monofacial meaning their ability to produce energy is a function of direct and diffuse irradiance on their front side most module manufacturers offer bifacial modules that also capture diffuse irradiance and reflected light on the back side of a module such technology can improve the overall energy production of a module relative to nameplate efficiency when applied in certain applications which could potentially lower the overall lcoe of a system when compared to systems using conventional solar modules including the modules we currently produce additionally certain module manufacturers recently introduced ntype monocrystalline modules such as topcon modules which are expected to provide certain improvements to module efficiency temperature coefficient and bifacial performance and claim to provide certain degradation advantages compared to other monocrystalline modules finally many of our competitors are promoting modules with larger overall area based on the use of larger silicon wafers while the transition to such larger wafers would increase nameplate wattage we believe the associated production cost would not improve significantly 

even if demand for solar modules continues to grow the rapid manufacturing capacity expansion undertaken by many module manufacturers in china and certain parts of southeast asia particularly manufacturers of crystalline silicon cells modules and wafers has created and may continue to cause periods of structural imbalance in which supply exceeds demand see the risk factor entitled “competition in solar markets globally and across the solar value chain is intense and could remain that way for an extended period of time an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations” for additional information in addition we believe any significant decrease in the cost of silicon feedstock or polysilicon would reduce the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon modules and lead to further pricing pressure for solar modules and potentially an oversupply of solar modules 

our competitors could decide to reduce their sales prices in response to competition even below their manufacturing costs in order to generate sales and may do so for a sustained period other competitors including many in china may have direct or indirect access to sovereign capital which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time as a result we may be unable to sell our solar modules at attractive prices or for a profit during any period of excess supply of solar modules which would reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations additionally we may decide to lower our average selling prices to customers in certain markets in response to competition which could also reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations 

problems with product quality or performance may cause us to incur significant andor unexpected contractual damages andor warranty and related expenses damage our market reputation and prevent us from maintaining or increasing our market share 

we perform a variety of module quality and life tests under different environmental conditions upon which we base our assessments of future module performance over the duration of the warranty however if our thin film solar modules perform below expectations we could experience significant warranty and related expenses damage to our market reputation and erosion of our market share with respect to our modules we provide a limited warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for up to 12 years we also typically warrant that modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 98 of their labeled power output rating during the first year with the warranty coverage reducing by a degradation factor every year thereafter throughout the limited power output warranty period of up to 30 years among other things our solar module warranty also covers the resulting power output loss from cell cracking as an alternative form of our standard limited module power output warranty we have also offered an aggregated or systemlevel limited module performance warranty this systemlevel limited module performance warranty is designed for utilityscale systems and provides 25year systemlevel energy degradation protection this warranty represents a practical expedient to address the challenge of identifying from the potential millions of modules installed in a utilityscale system individual modules that may be performing below warranty thresholds by focusing on the aggregate energy generated by the system rather than the power output of individual modules the systemlevel limited module performance warranty is typically calculated as a percentage of a system’s expected energy production adjusted for certain actual site conditions with the warranted level of performance declining each year in a linear fashion but never falling below 80 during the term of the warranty as a result of these warranty programs we bear the risk of product warranty claims long after we have sold our solar modules and recognized net sales 

if any of the assumptions used in estimating our module warranties prove incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses which could adversely impact our financial position operating results and cash flows although we have taken significant precautions to avoid a manufacturing excursion from occurring any manufacturing excursions including any commitments made by us to take remediation actions in respect of affected modules beyond the stated remedies in our warranties could adversely impact our reputation financial position operating results and cash flows 

although our module performance warranties extend for up to 30 years our oldest solar modules manufactured during the qualification of our pilot production line have only been in use since 2001 accordingly our warranties are based on a variety of quality and life tests that enable predictions of durability and future performance these predictions however could prove to be materially different from the actual performance during the warranty period causing us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective solar modules or provide financial remuneration in the future for example our solar modules could suffer various failures including breakage delamination corrosion or performance degradation in excess of expectations and our manufacturing operations or supply chain could be subject to materials or process variations that could cause affected modules to fail or underperform compared to our expectations these risks could be amplified as we implement design and process changes in connection with our efforts to improve our products and accelerate module wattage as part of our longterm strategic plans in addition if we increase the number of installations in extreme climates we may experience increased failure rates due to deployment into such field conditions any widespread product failures may damage our market reputation cause our net sales to decline require us to repair or replace the defective modules or provide financial remuneration and result in us taking voluntary remedial measures beyond those required by our standard warranty terms to enhance customer satisfaction which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

in resolving claims under both the limited defect and power output warranties we typically have the option of either repairing or replacing the covered modules or under the limited power output warranty providing additional modules to remedy the power shortfall or making certain cash payments however historical versions of our module warranty did not provide a refund remedy consequently we may be obligated to repair or replace the covered modules under such historical programs as our manufacturing process may change from timetotime in accordance with our technology roadmap we may elect to stop production of older versions of our modules that would constitute compatible replacement modules in some jurisdictions our inability to provide compatible replacement modules could potentially expose us to liabilities beyond the limitations of our module warranties which could adversely impact our reputation financial position operating results and cash flows 

in addition to our limited solar module warranties described above for pv solar power systems we have constructed for customers in prior periods we have provided limited warranties for defects in engineering design installation and balance of systems “bos” part workmanship for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a system or a block within the system bos parts represent mounting electrical and other parts used in pv solar power systems in resolving claims under such bos warranties we have the option of remedying the defect through repair or replacement as with our modules these warranties are based on a variety of quality and life tests that enable predictions of durability and future performance any failures in bos equipment beyond our expectations may also adversely impact our reputation financial position operating results and cash flows 

in addition our contracts with customers may include provisions with particular product specifications minimum wattage requirements and specified delivery schedules these contracts may be terminated or we may incur significant liquidated damages or other damages if we fail to perform our contractual obligations in addition our costs to perform under these contracts may exceed our estimates which could adversely impact our profitability any failures to comply with our contracts for the sale of our modules could adversely impact our reputation financial position operating results and cash flows 

our failure to further refine our technology and develop and introduce improved pv products including as a result of delays in implementing planned advancements could render our solar modules uncompetitive and reduce our net sales profitability andor market share 

we need to continue to invest significant financial resources in rd to continue to improve our module conversion efficiencies and otherwise keep pace with technological advances in the solar industry however rd activities are inherently uncertain and we could encounter practical difficulties in commercializing our research results we seek to continuously improve our products and processes including for example certain planned improvements to our cdte module technology and manufacturing capabilities such as the implementation of our cure program or the increase to our module form factor which we refer to as series 6 plus or series 7 and the resulting changes carry 

potential risks in the form of delays performance additional costs or other unintended contingencies for example the implementation of our cure program has been delayed as a result of certain challenges including in achieving full module performance entitlement in high volume manufacturing conditions and certain impediments to our ability to upgrade tooling to support our cure program as a result we have amended or will endeavor to amend certain related customer contracts including by potentially making certain price concessions and substituting other modules while we believe our cure program remains promising and that we will be able to resolve the challenges described above we may encounter unanticipated technological logistical or other challenges that could result in further delays to our cure program additionally the successful launch of our series 7 module technology which we expect to produce at our third manufacturing facility in the us and our first manufacturing facility in india is sensitive to changes in the final product size and module mounting structure among others while we believe that we will be able to manage these uncertainties we may encounter unanticipated challenges as we implement design and process changes in connection with this new module series 

any such additional challenges or other circumstances beyond our knowledge or control could result in material adverse impacts including additional pricing concessions in other customer contracts see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – certain trends and uncertainties” of this annual report on form 10k for additional information on our cure program 

our significant expenditures for rd may not produce corresponding benefits other companies are developing a variety of competing pv technologies including advanced monocrystalline silicon cells perc or advanced ptype crystalline silicon cells highefficiency ntype crystalline silicon cells bifacial solar modules and new emerging technologies such as hybrid perovskites or other thin films which could produce solar modules that prove more costeffective or have better performance than our solar modules we often forward price our products in anticipation of future technology improvements furthermore certain of our contracts with customers may include transaction price adjustments associated with future module technology improvements including new product designs and enhancements to certain energy related attributes accordingly an inability to further refine our technology and execute our module technology roadmap could adversely affect our operating results 

some of our manufacturing equipment is customized and sole sourced if our manufacturing equipment fails or if our equipment suppliers fail to perform under their contracts we could experience production disruptions and be unable to satisfy our contractual requirements 

some of our manufacturing equipment is customized to our production lines based on designs or specifications that we provide to equipment manufacturers which then undertake a specialized process to manufacture the custom equipment as a result the equipment is not readily available from multiple vendors and would be difficult to repair or replace if it were to become delayed damaged or stop working if any piece of equipment fails production along the entire production line could be interrupted in addition the failure of our equipment manufacturers to supply equipment in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms could delay our expansion or conversion plans otherwise disrupt our production schedule andor increase our manufacturing costs all of which would adversely impact our operating results 

several of our key raw materials and components are either singlesourced or sourced from a limited number of suppliers and their failure to perform could cause manufacturing delays and impair our ability to deliver solar modules to customers in the required quality and quantities and at a price that is profitable to us 

our failure to obtain raw materials and components that meet our quality quantity and cost requirements in a timely manner could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture our solar modules or increase our manufacturing costs several of our key raw materials and components are either singlesourced or sourced from a limited number of suppliers as a result the failure of any of our suppliers to perform could disrupt our supply chain and adversely impact our operations in addition some of our suppliers are smaller companies that may be unable to supply our increasing demand for raw materials and components as we expand our business we may be unable to identify new suppliers or qualify their products for use on our production lines in a timely manner and on commercially 

reasonable terms a constraint on our production may result in our inability to meet our capacity plans andor our obligations under our customer contracts which would have an adverse impact on our business additionally reductions in our production volume may put pressure on suppliers resulting in increased material and component costs 

a disruption in our supply chain for cdte other key raw materials or equipment could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture solar modules and could adversely impact our profitability and longterm growth prospects 

a key raw material used in our module production process is a cdte compound tellurium one of the main components of cdte is mainly produced as a byproduct of copper refining and therefore its supply is largely dependent upon demand for copper if our competitors begin to use or increase their demand for tellurium our requirements for tellurium increase new applications for tellurium become available or adverse trade laws or policies restrict our ability to obtain tellurium from foreign vendors or make doing so cost prohibitive the supply of tellurium and related cdte compounds could be reduced and prices could increase 

furthermore our supply chain could be limited if any of our current or future suppliers fail to perform or are unable to acquire an adequate supply in a timely manner or at commercially reasonable prices if our current or future suppliers cannot obtain sufficient raw materials or key equipment they could substantially increase prices or be unable to perform under their contracts additionally we may also be unable to effectively manage fluctuations in the availability and cost of logistics services associated with the procurement of raw materials or equipment used in our manufacturing process if we are unable to pass such cost increases to our customers a substantial increase in prices or any limitations or disruptions in our supply chain could adversely impact our profitability and longterm growth objectives refer also to the risk factor entitled “the covid19 pandemic could materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations” 

our failure to reduce module manufacturing production and selling costs including costs related to raw materials and logistics services could render our solar modules uncompetitive and reduce our net sales profitability andor market share 

certain of our key raw material purchase contracts include variable pricing terms which are driven by underlying indices for certain commodities including aluminum steel and natural gas among others fluctuations in such underlying commodity indices may increase our raw material costs additionally an increase in price levels generally such as inflation related to the cost of raw materials key manufacturing equipment labor and logistics services could adversely impact our profitability from time to time we may utilize derivative hedging instruments to mitigate price changes related to our raw materials or key manufacturing equipment our profitability could be adversely impacted if we are unable to effectively hedge such prices or pass these cost increases through to our customers we often forward price our products in anticipation of future cost reductions and thus an inability to execute our cost reduction roadmap could adversely affect our operating results 

our future success depends on our ability to effectively balance manufacturing production with market demand convert existing production facilities to support new product lines decrease our cost per watt and when necessary continue to build new manufacturing plants over time in response to market demand all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties 

our future success depends on our ability to effectively balance manufacturing production with market demand convert existing production facilities to support new product lines decrease our cost per watt and increase our manufacturing capacity in a costeffective and efficient manner if we cannot do so we may be unable to decrease our cost per watt maintain our competitive position sustain profitability expand our business or create longterm shareholder value our ability to decrease our cost per watt expand production capacity or convert existing production facilities to support new product lines is subject to significant risks and uncertainties including the following 

• failure to reduce manufacturing material labor or overhead costs 

• an inability to increase production throughput or the average power output per module or minimize manufacturing yield losses 

• failure to effectively manage the availability and cost of logistics services associated with the procurement of raw materials or equipment used in our manufacturing process and the shipping handling storage and distribution of our modules 

• delays and cost overruns as a result of a number of factors many of which may be beyond our control such as our inability to secure economical contracts with equipment vendors 

• our custombuilt equipment taking longer and costing more to manufacture than expected and not operating as designed 

• delays or denial of required approvals by relevant government authorities 

• an inability to hire qualified staff 

• failure to execute our expansion or conversion plans effectively 

• difficulty in balancing market demand and manufacturing production in an efficient and timely manner potentially causing our manufacturing capacity to be constrained in some future periods or oversupplied in others and 

• incurring manufacturing asset writedowns writeoffs and other charges and costs which may be significant during those periods in which we idle slow down shut down convert or otherwise adjust our manufacturing capacity 

if our estimates regarding the future costs of collecting and recycling cdte solar modules covered by our solar module collection and recycling program are incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses and face a significant unplanned cash burden 

as necessary we fund any incremental amounts for our estimated collection and recycling obligations on an annual basis based on the estimated costs of collecting and recycling covered modules estimated rates of return on our restricted marketable securities and an estimated solar module life of 25 years less amounts already funded in prior years we estimate the cost of our collection and recycling obligations based on the present value of the expected future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules which includes estimates for the cost of packaging materials the cost of freight from the solar module installation sites to a recycling center material labor and capital 

costs and byproduct credits for certain materials recovered during the recycling process we base these estimates on our experience collecting and recycling solar modules and certain assumptions regarding costs at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled if our estimates prove incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses and could also face a significant unplanned cash burden at the time we realize our estimates are incorrect or end users return their modules which could adversely affect our operating results in addition participating end users can return their modules covered under the collection and recycling program at any time as a result we could be required to collect and recycle covered cdte solar modules earlier than we expect 

our failure to protect our intellectual property rights may undermine our competitive position and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against thirdparty allegations of infringement may be costly 

protection of our proprietary processes methods and other technology is critical to our business failure to protect and monitor the use of our existing intellectual property rights could result in the loss of valuable technologies we rely primarily on patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property we regularly file patent applications to protect certain inventions arising from our rd and are currently pursuing such patent applications in various countries in accordance with our strategy for intellectual property in that jurisdiction our existing patents and future patents could be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents or if patents are issued to us such patents may not be sufficient to provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies 

we also rely on unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position although we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our associates and third parties to protect our intellectual property such confidentiality agreements are limited in duration and could be breached and may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary manufacturing expertise adequate remedies may not be available in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise in addition others may obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or legal means the failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes equipment technology trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise methods and compounds could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries especially any developing countries into which we may expand our operations in some countries we have not applied for patent trademark or copyright protection 

third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary technologies or other intellectual property rights which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology can be difficult and expensive additionally litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others we cannot ensure that the outcome of such potential litigation will be in our favor and such litigation may be costly and may divert management attention and other resources away from our business an adverse determination in any such litigation may impair our intellectual property rights and may harm our business prospects and reputation in addition we have no insurance coverage against such litigation costs and would have to bear all costs arising from such litigation to the extent we are unable to recover them from other parties 

if any future production lines are not built in line with committed schedules it may adversely affect our future growth plans if any future production lines do not achieve operating metrics similar to our existing production lines our solar modules could perform below expectations and cause us to lose customers 

if we are unable to systematically replicate our production lines over time and achieve operating metrics similar to our existing production lines our manufacturing capacity could be substantially constrained our manufacturing costs per watt could increase and our growth could be limited such factors may result in lower net sales and lower net income than we anticipate future production lines could produce solar modules that have lower conversion 

efficiencies higher failure rates andor higher rates of degradation than solar modules from our existing production lines and we could be unable to determine the cause of the lower operating metrics or develop and implement solutions to improve performance 

we recently announced plans to expand our manufacturing capacity by 66 gw dc by constructing our third manufacturing facility in the us and our first manufacturing facility in india these new facilities are currently under construction and are expected to commence operations in the first half of 2023 and the second half of 2023 respectively if we cannot successfully execute on our current capacity expansion plans we may incur significant costs in excess of our current plans to invest 14 billion in the aggregate for these new facilities if we are not able to effectively manage current or future expansion activities or realize their anticipated benefits it may adversely impact our results of operations 

our substantial international operations subject us to a number of risks including unfavorable political regulatory labor and tax conditions in the united states andor foreign countries 

we have significant manufacturing development sales and marketing operations both within and outside the united states and expect to continue to expand our operations worldwide as a result we are subject to the legal political social tax and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions 

risks inherent to international operations include but are not limited to the following 

• difficulty in enforcing agreements in foreign legal systems 

• varying degrees of protection afforded to foreign investments in the countries in which we operate and irregular interpretations and enforcement of laws and regulations in such jurisdictions 

• foreign countries may impose additional income and withholding taxes or otherwise tax our foreign operations impose tariffs or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade and investment including currency exchange controls 

• fluctuations in exchange rates may affect demand for our products and services and may adversely affect our profitability and cash flows in us dollars to the extent that our net sales or our costs are denominated in a foreign currency and the cost associated with hedging the us dollar equivalent of such exposures is prohibitive the longer the duration of such foreign currency exposure the greater the risk 

• anticorruption compliance issues including the costs related to the mitigation of such risk 

• risk of nationalization or other expropriation of private enterprises 

• changes in general economic and political conditions in the countries in which we operate including changes in government incentive provisions 

• unexpected adverse changes in us or foreign laws or regulatory requirements including those with respect to environmental protection import or export duties and quotas 

• opaque approval processes in which the lack of transparency may cause delays and increase the uncertainty of project approvals 

• difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations 

• difficulty in repatriating earnings 

• difficulty in negotiating a successful collective bargaining agreement in applicable foreign jurisdictions 

• trade barriers such as export requirements tariffs taxes local content requirements antidumping regulations and requirements and other restrictions and expenses which could increase the effective price of our solar modules and make us less competitive in some countries or increase the costs to perform under our existing contracts and 

• difficulty of and costs relating to compliance with the different commercial and legal requirements of the overseas countries in which we offer and sell our solar modules 

our business in foreign markets requires us to respond to rapid changes in market conditions in these countries our overall success as a global business depends in part on our ability to succeed in differing legal regulatory economic social and political conditions we may not be able to timely develop and implement policies and strategies that will be effective in each location where we do business 

project development or construction activities which are primarily concentrated in japan may not be successful projects under development may not receive required permits community support real property rights power purchase agreements “ppa” interconnection and transmission arrangements or financing or construction may not commence or proceed as scheduled which could increase our costs and impair our ability to recover our investments 

our residual business operations include certain project development activities that are primarily concentrated in japan the development and construction of solar energy generation facilities involve numerous risks we may be required to spend significant sums for land and interconnection rights preliminary engineering permitting lobbying legal services and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built success in developing a particular project is contingent upon among other things 

• obtaining and maintaining land rights for the project site transmission lines and environmental mitigation 

• receipt from governmental agencies of required environmental landuse and construction and operation permits and approvals 

• negotiation of development agreements public benefit agreements and other agreements to compensate local communities and governments for project impacts 

• receipt of rights to interconnect the project to the electric grid or to transmit energy 

• negotiation of satisfactory engineering procurement and construction “epc” agreements with thirdparty epc providers 

• securing necessary rights of way for access and transmission lines 

• obtaining financing including debt equity and funds required for development and construction and 

• payment of ppas interconnection and other deposits or security some of which are nonrefundable 

successful completion of a particular project may be adversely affected delayed andor rendered infeasible by numerous factors including 

• delays in obtaining and maintaining required governmental permits and approvals including appeals of approvals obtained 

• potential permit and litigation challenges from project stakeholders including local residents environmental organizations labor organizations and others who may oppose the project 

• unforeseen engineering problems 

• construction delays and contractor performance shortfalls 

• cost overruns 

• labor equipment and material supply shortages failures or disruptions 

• cost or schedule impacts arising from changes in regulatory policies and laws 

• project delays that could adversely impact our ability to maintain interconnection rights 

• additional complexities when conducting project development or construction activities in foreign jurisdictions either on a standalone basis or in collaboration with local business partners including operating in accordance with the fcpa and applicable local laws and customs 

• adverse environmental and geological conditions and 

• force majeure and other events out of our control 

if we fail to achieve systemlevel capacity or fail to meet other contract terms we may be subject to forfeiture of significant deposits under ppas or interconnection agreements or termination of such agreements incur significant liquidated damages penalties andor other obligations under other project related agreements and may not be able to recover our investment in the project if we are unable to complete the development of a solar energy project we may impair some or all of these capitalized investments which would have an adverse impact on our net income in the period in which the loss is recognized 

risks related to regulations 

existing regulations and policies changes thereto and new regulations and policies may present technical regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of pv solar products which may significantly reduce demand for our modules 

the market for electricity generation products is heavily influenced by federal state local and foreign government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry as well as policies promulgated by electric utilities these regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and interconnection of customerowned electricity generation in the united states and certain other countries these regulations and policies have been modified in the past and may be modified again in the future which could deter enduser purchases of pv solar products and investment in the rd of pv solar technology for example without a mandated regulatory exception for pv solar power systems system owners are often charged interconnection or standby fees for putting distributed power generation on the electric utility grid to the extent these interconnection standby fees are applicable to pv solar power systems it is likely that they would increase the cost of such systems which could make the systems less desirable thereby adversely affecting our business financial condition and results of operations 

our modules are often subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with national and local ordinances relating to building codes safety environmental protection and other matters and tracking the requirements of individual jurisdictions is complex any new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to our modules may result in significant additional expenses to us or our customers and as a result could cause a significant reduction in demand for our products in addition any regulatory compliance failure could result in significant management distraction unplanned costs andor reputational damage 

we could be adversely affected by any violations of the fcpa the uk bribery act and other foreign antibribery laws  

the fcpa generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business other countries in which we operate also have antibribery laws some of which prohibit improper payments to government and nongovernment persons and entities and others eg the fcpa and the uk bribery act extend their application to activities outside their country of origin our policies mandate compliance with all applicable antibribery laws we currently operate in and may further expand into key parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices in addition due to the level of regulation in our industry our operations in certain jurisdictions including china india south america and the middle east require substantial government contact either directly by us or through intermediaries over whom we have less direct control such as subcontractors agents and partners such as joint venture partners where norms can differ from us standards although we have implemented policies procedures and in certain cases contractual arrangements designed to facilitate compliance with these antibribery laws our officers directors associates subcontractors agents and partners may take actions in violation of our policies procedures contractual arrangements and antibribery laws any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could subject us and such persons to criminal andor civil penalties or other sanctions potentially by government prosecutors from more than one country which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and reputation 

environmental obligations and liabilities could have a substantial negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations involve the use handling generation processing storage transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations at the national state local and international levels these environmental laws and regulations include those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the use management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites and occupational health and safety as we expand our business into foreign jurisdictions worldwide our environmental compliance burden may continue to increase both in terms of magnitude and complexity we have incurred and may continue to incur significant costs in complying with these laws and regulations in addition violations of or liabilities under environmental laws or permits may result in restrictions being imposed on our operating activities or in our being subject to substantial fines penalties criminal proceedings thirdparty property damage or personal injury claims cleanup costs or other costs while we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements future developments such as more aggressive enforcement policies the implementation of new more stringent laws and regulations or the discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our solar modules contain cdte and other semiconductor materials elemental cadmium and certain of its compounds are regulated as hazardous materials due to the adverse health effects that may arise from human exposure based on existing research the risks of exposure to cdte are not believed to be as serious as those relating to exposure to elemental cadmium due to cdte’s limited bioavailability in our manufacturing operations we maintain engineering controls to minimize our associates’ exposure to cadmium compounds and require our associates who handle cadmium compounds to follow certain safety procedures including the use of personal protective equipment such as respirators chemical goggles and protective clothing relevant studies and thirdparty peer reviews of our technology have concluded that the risk of exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds from our endproducts is negligible in addition the risk of exposure is further minimized by the encapsulated nature of these materials in our products the physical properties of cadmium compounds used in our products and the recycling or responsible disposal of our modules while we believe that these factors and procedures are sufficient to protect our associates end users and the general public from adverse health effects that may arise from cadmium exposure we cannot ensure that human or environmental exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds used in our products will not occur any such exposure could result in future thirdparty claims against us damage to our reputation and heightened regulatory scrutiny which could limit or impair our ability to sell and distribute our products the occurrence of future events such as these could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the use of cadmium or cadmium compounds in various products is also coming under increasingly stringent governmental regulation future regulation in this area could impact the manufacturing sale collection and recycling of solar modules and could require us to make unforeseen environmental expenditures or limit our ability to sell and distribute our products for example european union directive 201165eu on the restriction of the use of hazardous substances “rohs” in electrical and electronic equipment the “rohs directive” restricts the use of certain hazardous substances including cadmium and its compounds in all electronic equipment sold into the european market unless excluded from the law currently pv solar modules are explicitly excluded from the scope of rohs article 2 as adopted in june 2011 other jurisdictions have adopted similar legislation or are considering doing so the next revision of the rohs directive is expected in 2022 if pv modules were to be included in the scope of future rohs revisions without an exemption or exclusion we would be required to redesign our solar modules to reduce cadmium and other affected hazardous substances to the maximum allowable concentration thresholds in the rohs directive in order to continue to offer them for sale within the eu as such actions would be impractical this type of regulatory development would effectively close the eu market to us which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

general risk factors 

the covid19 pandemic could materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

the covid19 pandemic has continued to have an unprecedented impact on the united states malaysia vietnam india and other countries throughout the world including those in which we do business or have operations the extent to which the covid19 pandemic could impact us continues to be highly uncertain and cannot be predicted and will depend largely on subsequent developments including the severity and duration of the pandemic measures taken to contain the spread of the virus such as restrictions on travel and gatherings of people and temporary closures of or limitations on businesses and other commercial activities and the timing and nature of policies implemented by governmental authorities to ease such measures 

as a result of the covid19 pandemic and these related containment measures and reopening policies we may be subject to significant risks which have the potential to materially and adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations including the following 

• we may at any time be ordered by governmental authorities or we may determine based on our understanding of the recommendations or orders of governmental authorities that we have to curtail or cease business operations or activities including manufacturing 

• the failure of our suppliers or vendors to supply materials or equipment or the failure of our vendors to install repair or replace our specialized equipment due to the covid19 pandemic and related containment measures may idle slowdown shutdown or otherwise cause us to adjust our manufacturing capacity and the availability and cost of logistics services associated with the procurement of raw materials or equipment used in our manufacturing process and the shipping handling storage and distribution of our modules may require us to adjust our module manufacturing plans or module delivery commitments which may result in additional unplanned charges we have incurred manufacturing charges associated with the ongoing covid19 pandemic 

• we perform substantial rd to continue to improve our module wattage or conversion efficiency lower our module cost per watt and otherwise keep pace with technological advances in the solar industry the covid19 pandemic and related containment measures including the unavailability of our personnel and thirdparty partners who are engaged in rd activities may inhibit our rd efforts our ability to timely advance or commercialize these efforts or otherwise implement our technology roadmap such as our cure program and 

• the majority of our associates who are capable of performing their function remotely are telecommuting ie working from home while we have instituted security measures to minimize the likelihood and impact of a cybersecurity incident with respect to associates utilizing technological communications tools these measures may be inadequate to prevent a cybersecurity breach because of the unprecedented number of associates using these tools any increase in the frequency or scope of cyberattacks may exacerbate the aforementioned cybersecurity risks in addition while we have among other things established enhanced cleaning procedures at our facilities and protocols for responding when our associates are infected we cannot assure these will be sufficient to mitigate the risks faced by our work force or the liability we may face as a result of any outbreaks of covid19 

if our longlived assets or project related assets become impaired we may be required to record significant charges to earnings 

we may be required to record significant charges to earnings should we determine that our longlived assets or project related assets are impaired such charges may have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations we review longlived and project related assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable we consider a project commercially viable or recoverable if it is anticipated to be sold for a profit once it is either fully developed or fully constructed or if the expected operating cash flows from future power generation exceed the cost basis of the asset if our projects are not considered commercially viable we would be required to impair the respective assets 

cyberattacks or other breaches of our information systems or those of third parties with which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations rely on our computer systems hardware software and networks as well as those of third parties with which we do business to securely process store and transmit proprietary confidential and other information including intellectual property and personal identifiable information we also rely heavily on these information systems to operate our manufacturing lines these information systems may be compromised by cyberattacks computer viruses and other events that could be materially disruptive to our business operations and could put the security of our information and that of the third parties with which we do business at risk of misappropriation or destruction in recent years such cyber incidents have become increasingly frequent and sophisticated targeting or otherwise affecting a wide range of companies while we have instituted security measures and procured insurance to minimize the likelihood and impact of a cyber incident there is no assurance that these measures or those of the third parties with which we do business will be adequate in the future if these measures fail valuable information may be lost our operations may be disrupted we may be unable to fulfill our customer obligations and our reputation may suffer for example any cyber incident affecting our automated manufacturing lines could adversely affect our ability to produce solar modules or otherwise affect the quality and performance of the modules produced we may also be subject to litigation regulatory action remedial expenses and financial losses beyond the scope or limits of our insurance coverage these consequences of a failure of security measures could individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as a result of the covid19 pandemic the vast majority of our associates who are capable of performing their function remotely are telecommuting which may exacerbate the aforementioned cybersecurity risks see the risk factor entitled “the covid19 pandemic could materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations” 

if we are unable to attract train retain and successfully integrate key personnel into our management team our business may be materially and adversely affected 

our future success depends to a significant extent on our ability to attract train and retain management operations sales and technical personnel including personnel in foreign jurisdictions recruiting and retaining capable personnel particularly those with expertise in the pv solar industry across a variety of technologies are vital to our success we are also dependent on the services of our executive officers and other members of our senior management team the loss of one or more of these key associates or any other member of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business we may not be able to retain or replace these key associates and may not have adequate succession plans in place several of our current key associates including our executive officers are subject to employment conditions or arrangements that contain postemployment noncompetition provisions however these arrangements permit the associates to terminate their employment with us upon little or no notice 

there is substantial competition for qualified technical and manufacturing personnel and while we continue to benchmark our organization against the broad spectrum of business in our market space to remain economically competitive there can be no assurances that we will be able to attract and retain our technical personnel as we continue to expand domestically and internationally we may encounter regional laws that mandate union representation or associates who desire union representation or a collective bargaining agreement if we are unable to attract and retain qualified associates or otherwise experience unexpected labor disruptions within our business we may be materially and adversely affected 

we may be exposed to infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties which if determined adversely to us could cause us to pay significant damage awards or prohibit us from the manufacture and sale of our solar modules or the use of our technology 

our success depends largely on our ability to use and develop our technology and knowhow without infringing or misappropriating the intellectual property rights of third parties the validity and scope of claims relating to pv solar technology patents involve complex scientific legal and factual considerations and analysis and therefore may be highly uncertain we may be subject to litigation involving claims of patent infringement or violation of intellectual property rights of third parties the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits patent opposition proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings can be both costly and time consuming and may significantly divert the efforts and resources of our technical and management personnel an adverse determination in any such litigation or proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liability to third parties require us to seek licenses from third parties which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all or pay ongoing royalties require us to redesign our solar modules or subject us to injunctions prohibiting the manufacture and sale of our solar modules or the use of our technologies protracted litigation could also result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of our solar modules until the resolution of such litigation 

currency translation and transaction risk may negatively affect our results of operations 

although our reporting currency is the us dollar we conduct certain business and incur costs in the local currency of most countries in which we operate as a result we are subject to currency translation and transaction risk for example certain of our net sales in 2021 were denominated in foreign currencies such as japanese yen and euro and we expect to continue to have net sales denominated in foreign currencies in the future certain business arrangements with strategic partners outside the united states have involved and may involve significant investments denominated in local currencies changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar could affect our results of operations and result in exchange gains or losses we cannot accurately predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations 

we could also expand our business into emerging markets many of which have an uncertain regulatory environment relating to currency policy conducting business in such emerging markets could cause our exposure to changes in exchange rates to increase due to the relatively high volatility associated with emerging market currencies and potentially longer payment terms for our proceeds 

our ability to hedge foreign currency exposure is dependent on our credit profile with the banks that are willing and able to do business with us deterioration in our credit position or a significant tightening of the credit market conditions could limit our ability to hedge our foreign currency exposures and therefore result in exchange gains or losses 

unanticipated changes in our tax provision the enactment of new tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate accordingly we are subject to a variety of tax laws and interpretations of such laws by local tax authorities for example in march 2020 the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the “cares act” was signed into us law the final effects of the cares act may differ from the amounts provided elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k possibly materially due to among other things any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the cares act and any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the cares act or actions we may take as a result of the cares act additionally in january 2022 the us government published new regulations in the us federal register to address various aspects of foreign tax credit regimes including among other things guidance related to the disallowance of credits or deductions for foreign income taxes these regulations which are effective in march 2022 contain certain provisions that are applicable for periods prior to the effective date and the final effects could result in material income tax expense in future periods furthermore longstanding international tax laws that determine each country’s jurisdictional tax rights in crossborder international trade continue to evolve as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting reporting requirements recommended by the organization for economic cooperation and development changes to these and other tax laws and regulations could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to potential tax examinations in various jurisdictions and taxing authorities may disagree with our interpretations of us and foreign tax laws and may assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these examinations in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however the outcome of tax examinations cannot be predicted with certainty therefore the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of such examinations could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure losses of tax holidays changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings among countries with tax holidays or differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process any changes in our effective tax rate may have a material adverse impact on our business financial conditions and results of operations 

we have been and may be subject to or involved in litigation or threatened litigation the outcome of which may be difficult to predict and which may be costly to defend divert management attention require us to pay damages or restrict the operation of our business 

from time to time we have been and may be subject to disputes and litigation with and without merit that may be costly and which may divert the attention of our management and our resources in general whether or not any dispute actually proceeds to litigation the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict moreover complaints filed against us may not specify the amount of damages that plaintiffs seek and we therefore may be unable to estimate the possible range of damages that might be incurred should these lawsuits be resolved against us even if we are able to estimate losses related to these actions the ultimate amount of loss may be materially higher than our estimates any resolution of litigation or threatened litigation could involve the payment of damages or expenses by us which may be significant or involve an agreement with terms that restrict the operation of our business even if any future lawsuits are not resolved against us the costs of defending such lawsuits may be significant these costs may exceed the dollar limits of our insurance policies or may not be covered at all by our insurance policies because the price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile we can provide no assurance that additional securities or other litigation will not be filed against us in the future see note 13 “commitments and contingencies – legal proceedings” to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our legal proceedings 

changes in or any failure to comply with privacy laws regulations and standards may adversely affect our business 

personal privacy and data security have become significant issues in the united states europe and in many other jurisdictions in which we operate the regulatory framework for privacy and security issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future furthermore federal state or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted and may in the future adopt laws and regulations affecting data privacy all of which may be subject to invalidation by relevant foreign judicial bodies industry organizations also regularly adopt and advocate for new standards in this area 

in the united states these include rules and regulations promulgated or pending under the authority of federal agencies state attorneys general legislatures and consumer protection agencies internationally many jurisdictions in which we operate have established their own data security and privacy legal framework with which we relevant suppliers and customers must comply for example the general data protection regulation a broadbased data privacy regime enacted by the european parliament which became effective in may 2018 imposes new requirements on how we collect process transfer and store personal data and also imposes additional obligations potential penalties and risk upon our business additionally the california consumer privacy act which became effective in january 2020 imposes similar data privacy requirements in many jurisdictions enforcement actions and consequences for noncompliance are also rising in addition to government regulation privacy advocates and industry groups may propose new and different selfregulatory standards that either legally or contractually apply to us although we have implemented policies procedures and in certain cases contractual arrangements designed to facilitate compliance with applicable privacy and data security laws and standards any inability or perceived inability to adequately address privacy and security concerns even if unfounded or comply with applicable privacy and data security laws regulations and policies could result in additional fines costs and liabilities to us damage our reputation inhibit sales and adversely affect our business 

our amended and restated bylaws designate a state or federal court located within the state of delaware as the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders and the federal district courts of the united states as the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action under the securities act of 1933 which could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers employees agents or stockholders 

our amended and restated bylaws “bylaws” provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the court of chancery of the state of delaware or if the court of chancery of the state of delaware lacks subject matter jurisdiction the federal district court for the district of delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for i any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf ii any action or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors officers other employees agents or stockholders to us or our stockholders iii any action or proceeding against us or any of our directors officers other employees agents or stockholders arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law “dgcl” our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our bylaws iv any action or proceeding against us or any of our directors officers or other employees asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine or v any action or proceeding asserting an “internal corporate claim” as defined in the dgcl our bylaws also provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the federal district courts of the united states are the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action under the securities act nothing in our bylaws precludes stockholders that assert claims under the exchange act from bringing such claims in any court subject to applicable law 

any person or entity holding owning or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to these provisions these exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors officers other employees agents or stockholders which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors officers other employees agents or stockholders the enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ governing documents has been challenged in legal proceedings and it is possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable for example in december 2018 the court of chancery of the state of delaware determined that a provision stating that federal district courts of the united states are the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the securities act is not enforceable although this decision was reversed by the delaware supreme court in march 2020 courts in other states may still find these provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable if a court were to find the exclusive forum provisions in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions which could adversely affect our results of operations

executive overview 

we are a leading american solar technology company and global provider of pv solar energy solutions developed at our rd labs in california and ohio we manufacture and sell pv solar modules with an advanced thin film semiconductor technology that provide a highperformance lowercarbon alternative to conventional crystalline silicon pv solar modules from raw material sourcing through endoflife module recycling we are committed to reducing the environmental impacts and enhancing the social and economic benefits of our products across their life cycle we are the world’s largest thin film pv solar module manufacturer and the largest pv solar module manufacturer in the western hemisphere 

certain of our financial results and other key operational developments for the year ended december 31 2021 include the following 

• net sales for 2021 increased by 8 to 29 billion compared to 27 billion in 2020 the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to an increase in the volume of modules sold to third parties the sales of certain projects in the united states and japan in the current period and the settlement of an outstanding indemnification arrangement associated with the sale of one of our projects partially offset by the sales of certain projects in japan the united states and india in the prior period and a decrease in the average selling price per watt see note 13 “commitments and contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of our indemnification arrangements 

• gross profit decreased 01 percentage points to 250 in 2021 from 251 in 2020 primarily due to a decrease in the average selling price per watt of our modules the volume of higher gross profit projects sold during the prior period and an increase in logistics costs partially offset by continued module cost reductions and the indemnification matter mentioned above 

• as of december 31 2021 we had 79 gw dc of total installed nameplate module production capacity across all our facilities we produced 79 gw dc of solar modules during 2021 which represented a 34 increase in series 6 module production from 2020 the increase in series 6 production was primarily driven by the incremental series 6 production capacity added in malaysia in early 2021 and higher throughput at our manufacturing facilities we expect to produce between 82 gw dc and 88 gw dc of series 6 and series 6 plus modules during 2022 

• during 2021 we announced plans to expand our manufacturing capacity by 66 gw dc by constructing our third manufacturing facility in the us and our first manufacturing facility in india these new facilities are expected to commence operations in the first half of 2023 and the second half of 2023 respectively 

• following an evaluation of the longterm cost structure competitiveness and riskadjusted returns of our om services business we received an offer to purchase certain portions of the business and determined it was in the best interest of our stockholders to pursue this transaction accordingly in august 2020 we entered into an agreement with a subsidiary of clairvest group inc “clairvest” for the sale of our north american om operations we completed the transaction in march 2021 following certain customary postclosing adjustments we received total consideration of 1491 million as a result of this transaction we recognized a gain of 1158 million net of transaction costs and postclosing adjustments which is presented in “gain on sales of businesses net” in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31 2021 

• following a separate evaluation of the longterm cost structure competitiveness and riskadjusted returns of our us project development business we determined it was also in the best interest of our stockholders to pursue the sale of this business in january 2021 we entered into an agreement with leeward renewable energy development llc “leeward” a subsidiary of the ontario municipal employees retirement system for the sale of our us project development business which included developing contracting for the construction of and selling utilityscale pv solar power systems in the united states the transaction included our approximately 10 gw ac utilityscale solar project pipeline including the advancedstage horizon madison ridgely rabbitbrush and oak trail projects the 30 mw ac barilla solar project which is operational and certain other equipment in addition leeward agreed to certain module purchase commitments we completed the transaction in march 2021 for an aggregate purchase price of 2840 million such purchase price included 1514 million for the sale of the us project development business and 1326 million for the sale of 392 mw dc of solar modules which is presented in “net sales” on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31 2021 as a result of this transaction we recognized a gain of 315 million net of transaction costs and postclosing adjustments which is presented in “gain on sales of businesses net” in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31 2021 

• in late 2021 we received an offer to purchase our project development and om services businesses in japan and determined it was in the best interest of our stockholders to pursue this transaction as a result we expect to enter into an agreement for the sale of these businesses in the near term the completion of the transaction is contingent on the completion of final contract negotiations and the achievement of certain closing conditions assuming satisfaction of such items we expect the sale to be completed in the first half of 2022 

market overview 

global solar markets continue to expand and develop in part aided by demand elasticity resulting from declining average selling prices both at the module and system levels which has promoted the widespread adoption of solar energy as a result of such market opportunities we recently announced plans to expand our manufacturing capacity by 66 gw dc by constructing our third manufacturing facility in the us and our first manufacturing facility in india these new facilities which we expect to produce our next generation series 7 modules are currently under construction and are expected to commence operations in the first half of 2023 and the second half of 2023 respectively in the aggregate we believe manufacturers of solar cells and modules particularly those in china have significant installed production capacity relative to global demand and the ability for additional capacity expansion accordingly we believe the solar industry may experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity exceeds global demand and that excess capacity will also put pressure on pricing in light of such market realities we continue to focus on our strategies and points of differentiation which include our advanced module technology our manufacturing process our research and development capabilities the sustainability advantage of our modules and our financial stability 

the solar industry continues to be characterized by intense pricing competition both at the module and system levels this competition may result in an environment in which pricing falls rapidly thereby potentially increasing 

demand for solar energy solutions but constraining the ability for project developers and module manufacturers to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability although module average selling prices in many global markets have declined for several years recent module spot pricing has increased in part due to elevated commodity and freight costs for example the price of polysilicon has significantly increased in recent months due to a coal shortage in china which resulted in higher energy prices and the chinese government mandating power restrictions that led to curtailments of silicon metal production given the majority of global polysilicon capacity is located in china such higher energy prices and reduced operating capacities have adversely affected the supply of polysilicon contributing to an increase in polysilicon pricing in response to such supply shortage certain other chinesebased producers of polysilicon are in the process of expanding their production capacity which is expected to reduce the price of polysilicon in future periods accordingly while the duration of this elevated period of spot pricing is uncertain module average selling prices in global markets are expected to continue to decline in the longterm 

competitive pricing for modules and systems relative to the cost of traditional forms of energy generation is expected to contribute to diversification in global electricity generation and further demand for solar energy over time however declining average selling prices may adversely affect our results of operations to the extent we have not already entered into contracts for future module sales our results of operations could also be adversely affected if competitors reduce pricing to levels below their costs bid aggressively low prices for module sale agreements or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time for certain of our competitors including many in china these practices may be enabled by their direct or indirect access to sovereign capital or other forms of stateowned support in certain markets in california and elsewhere an oversupply imbalance at the grid level may reduce shorttomedium term demand for new solar installations relative to prior years lower pricing for ppas and lower margins on module and system sales to such markets however we believe the effects of such imbalance can be mitigated by modern solar power plants and energy storage solutions that offer a flexible operating profile thereby promoting greater grid stability and enabling a higher penetration of solar energy we continue to address these uncertainties in part by executing on our module technology improvements and implementing certain other cost reduction initiatives 

we face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules solar module manufacturers compete with one another on sales price per watt which may be influenced by several module value attributes including wattage through a larger form factor or an improved conversion efficiency energy yield degradation sustainability reliability warranty terms and customer payment terms while conventional solar modules including the solar modules we currently produce are monofacial meaning their ability to produce energy is a function of direct and diffuse irradiance on their front side most module manufacturers offer bifacial modules that also capture diffuse irradiance on the back side of a module bifaciality compromises nameplate efficiency but by converting both front and rear side irradiance such technology may improve the overall energy production of a module relative to nameplate efficiency when applied in certain applications which could potentially lower the overall lcoe of a system when compared to systems using conventional solar modules including the modules we currently produce additionally certain module manufacturers recently introduced ntype monocrystalline modules such as topcon modules which are expected to provide certain improvements to module efficiency temperature coefficient and bifacial performance and claim to provide certain degradation advantages compared to other monocrystalline modules 

we believe we are among the lowest cost module manufacturers in the solar industry on a module cost per watt basis based on publicly available information this cost competitiveness allows us to compete favorably in markets where pricing for modules and systems is highly competitive our cost competitiveness is based in large part on our advanced thinfilm semiconductor technology module wattage or conversion efficiency proprietary manufacturing process which enables us to produce a cdte module in a matter of hours using a continuous and highly automated industrial manufacturing process as opposed to a batch process and our focus on operational excellence in addition our cdte modules use approximately 2 of the amount of semiconductor material that is used to manufacture conventional crystalline silicon solar modules the cost of polysilicon is a significant driver of the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules and the timing and rate of change in the cost of silicon feedstock and polysilicon could lead to changes in solar module pricing levels in recent years polysilicon 

consumption per cell has been reduced through various initiatives such as the adoption of diamond wire saw technology which have contributed to declines in our relative manufacturing cost competitiveness over conventional crystalline silicon module manufacturers 

in terms of performance in many climates our solar modules provide certain energy production advantages relative to competing crystalline silicon modules for more information about these advantages see item 1 “business – business strategy” additionally we warrant that our solar modules will produce at least 98 of their labeled power output rating during the first year with the warranty coverage reducing by a degradation factor between 03 and 05 depending on the module series every year thereafter throughout the limited power output warranty period of up to 30 years following the implementation of our cure program we expect the warranted degradation of our modules to decline to 02 per year in the near term as a result of these and other factors our solar modules can produce more annual energy in real world operating conditions than conventional crystalline silicon modules with the same nameplate capacity for more information about the risks associated with our cure program see item 1a “risk factors – our failure to further refine our technology and develop and introduce improved pv products including as a result of delays in implementing planned advancements could render our solar modules uncompetitive and reduce our net sales profitability andor market share ” 

while our modules are generally competitive in cost reliability and performance attributes there can be no guarantee such competitiveness will continue to exist in the future to the same extent or at all any declines in the competitiveness of our products could result in further declines in the average selling prices of our modules and additional margin compression we continue to focus on enhancing the competitiveness of our solar modules by accelerating progress along our module technology and cost reduction roadmaps 

certain trends and uncertainties 

we believe that our business financial condition and results of operations may be favorably or unfavorably impacted by the following trends and uncertainties see item 1a “risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for discussions of other risks that may affect us 

our business is evolving worldwide and is shaped by the varying ways in which our offerings can be compelling and economically viable solutions to energy needs in various markets in addressing such demand for electricity we are focusing on providing utilityscale module offerings in key geographic markets that we believe have a compelling need for massscale pv solar electricity including markets throughout the united states india europe and japan we closely evaluate and monitor the appropriate level of resources required to support such markets and their associated sales opportunities when deployed in utilityscale applications our modules provide energy at a lower lcoe compared to traditional forms of energy generation making them an attractive alternative to or replacement for aging fossil fuelbased generation resources based on publicly available information retirements of coal generation plants in the united states alone are expected to approximate 50 gw dc over the next ten years representing a significant increase in the potential market for solar energy in the near term 

this focus on utilityscale module offerings exists within a current market environment that includes rooftop and distributed generation solar particularly in the united states while it is unclear how rooftop and distributed generation solar might impact our core offerings over the next several years we believe that utilityscale solar will continue to be a compelling offering for companies with technology and cost leadership and will continue to represent an increasing portion of the overall electricity generation mix however our module offerings in certain markets may be driven in part by future demand for rooftop and distributed generation solar solutions 

demand for our pv solar module offerings depends in part on market factors outside our control such as the availability of debt andor equity financing including in the united states tax equity financing interest rate fluctuations domestic or international trade policies government regulations and government support programs many governments have proposed policies or support programs intended to encourage renewable energy investments such support programs may include additional incentives over several years for renewable energy 

projects or manufacturers of renewable energy products for example during 2021 legislation was introduced in the us congress to incentivize domestic solar manufacturing and accelerate the transition to clean energy by providing tax credits for us solar manufacturers and project developers among other things such proposed legislation extends the investment tax credit up to 40 for 10 years for solar projects that satisfy certain domestic content labor and wage requirements introduces certain refundable tax credits for solar module components manufactured in the us revives certain tax credits for capital investments in the manufacturing of solar module components and expands the scope of production tax credits for energy storage projects at this time it is unclear whether and to what extent such measures will be enacted into law if such legislation is successfully signed into law or other similar policies or support programs are enacted it could positively impact our business financial condition and results of operations while we compete in many markets that do not require solarspecific government subsidies or support programs our net sales and profits remain subject to variability based on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives adverse changes in these factors could increase the cost of utilityscale systems which could reduce demand for our pv solar modules 

we generally price and sell our solar modules on a per watt basis as of december 31 2021 we had entered into contracts with customers for the future sale of 219 gw dc of solar modules for an aggregate transaction price of  59 billion which we expect to recognize as revenue through 2025 as we transfer control of the modules to the customers such volume includes contracts for the sale of 73 gw dc of solar modules that include transaction price adjustments associated with future module technology improvements including new product designs and enhancements to certain energy related attributes based on these potential technology improvements the contracted module volumes as of december 31 2021 and the expected timing of module deliveries such adjustments if realized could result in additional revenue of up to 02 billion the majority of which would be recognized in 2023 in addition to these price adjustments certain of our contracts with customers may also include favorable price adjustments for the proposed extension of the us investment tax credit described above 

our ability to provide pv solar modules on economically attractive terms is also affected by the availability and cost of logistics services associated with the procurement of raw materials or equipment used in our manufacturing process and the shipping handling storage and distribution of our modules for example the cost of ocean freight throughout many parts of the world has continued to increase due to the limited availability of shipping containers increased port congestion resulting from labor shortages an increase in cancellations of shipments by logistics providers and elevated fuel costs such factors may disrupt our supply chain and adversely impact our manufacturing operations as several of our key raw materials and components are either singlesourced or sourced from a limited number of suppliers in response to these disruptions we have accommodated certain requests for delayed shipments in an effort to manage our shipping routes and mitigate our exposure to uncontracted freight rates additionally due to ongoing schedule reliability issues with many operating ships we are adjusting our shipping plans to include additional lead time for module deliveries and utilizing our us distribution network to better meet our customer commitments for certain contracts with customers we have also started employing module contract structures that provide additional consideration to us if logistic costs exceed a defined threshold additionally our manufacturing capacity expansions in the us and india are expected to bring manufacturing activities closer to customer demand further mitigating our exposure to the cost of ocean freight while it is currently unclear how long these issues will persist they may be further exacerbated by the disruption of major shipping routes or other economic disruptions caused by the covid19 pandemic 

we continue to invest significant financial resources in rd initiatives including in efforts to enhance module performance such as our cure program however our cure program has encountered certain challenges in achieving full module performance entitlement in high volume manufacturing conditions which together with covid19 related travel restrictions quarantine requirements and government orders impacting our ability to upgrade tooling to support our cure program at our manufacturing facilities in malaysia and vietnam has resulted in delays in implementing our cure program we previously revised our expected integration schedule to early 2022 for our lead line implementation our ability to implement our cure program by such time will be based on the results of a series of production tests in high volume manufacturing conditions this and further testing will ultimately inform our lead line implementation timing and our subsequent fleetwide replication schedule in 

connection with the aforementioned challenges we have amended or will endeavor to amend certain customer contracts for modules utilizing cure technology including by potentially making certain price concessions and substituting our other modules for the modules with cure technology that were expected to be delivered under the terms of the original customer contracts for more information about the risks associated with our cure program see item 1a “risk factors  our failure to further refine our technology and develop and introduce improved pv products including as a result of delays in implementing planned advancements could render our solar modules uncompetitive and reduce our net sales profitability andor market share” 

on occasion we have elected to temporarily own and operate certain pv solar power systems with the intention to sell them at a later date as of december 31 2021 and 2020 the recoverability of our luz del norte pv solar power plant was based in part on the likelihood of our continued ownership and operation of the system however it is reasonably possible that our intent to hold the asset may change in the near term due to our evaluation of strategic sale opportunities for the system the pursuit of such opportunities which require coordination with the system’s lenders may result in a determination that the carrying value of the system is not recoverable based on the probabilityweighted undiscounted future cash flows which in turn could result in a possible impairment of the system in future periods accordingly any changes in our expected use of the asset or its disposition may result in impairment charges that could be material to our consolidated financial statements and have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations 

we continually evaluate forecasted global demand competition and our addressable market and seek to effectively balance manufacturing capacity with market demand and the nature and extent of our competition we continue to increase the nameplate production capacity of our existing manufacturing facilities by improving our production throughput increasing module wattage or conversion efficiency and improving manufacturing yield losses additionally we recently announced plans to expand our manufacturing capacity by 66 gw dc by constructing our third manufacturing facility in the us and our first manufacturing facility in india such additional capacity and any other potential investments to add or otherwise modify our existing manufacturing capacity in response to market demand and competition may require significant internal and possibly external sources of capital and may be subject to certain risks and uncertainties described in item 1a “risk factors” including those described under the headings “our future success depends on our ability to effectively balance manufacturing production with market demand convert existing production facilities to support new product lines decrease our cost per watt and when necessary continue to build new manufacturing plants over time in response to market demand all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties” and “if any future production lines are not built in line with committed schedules it may adversely affect our future growth plans if any future production lines do not achieve operating metrics similar to our existing production lines our solar modules could perform below expectations and cause us to lose customers” 

in response to the covid19 pandemic governmental authorities have recommended or ordered the limitation or cessation of certain business or commercial activities in jurisdictions in which we do business or have operations while some of these orders permit the continuation of essential business operations or permit the performance of minimum business activities these orders are subject to continuous revision or may be revoked or superseded or our understanding of the applicability of these orders and exemptions may change at any time in addition due to contraction of the virus or concerns about becoming ill from the virus we may experience reductions in the availability of our operational workforce such as our manufacturing personnel as a result we may at any time be ordered by governmental authorities or we may determine based on our understanding of the recommendations or orders of governmental authorities or the availability of our personnel that we have to curtail or cease business operations or activities altogether including manufacturing fulfillment research and development activities the implementation of our technology roadmap such as certain series 6 plus manufacturing upgrades in vietnam and our cure program or construction activities associated with our expanding manufacturing capacity at this time such limitations have had a minimal effect on our manufacturing facilities with the exception of the aforementioned technology roadmap delays and we have implemented a wide range of safety measures intended to enable the continuity of our operations and inhibit the spread of covid19 at our manufacturing administrative and other sites and facilities including those in the united states malaysia and vietnam 

while we continue to work with relevant government agencies in malaysia and vietnam to allow the essential travel of personnel that support the implementation of our technology roadmap such implementation may be delayed and in the case of our cure program has been delayed due to travel restrictions quarantine requirements other government orders or increases in covid19 infection rates see item 1a risk factors – “the covid19 pandemic could materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations” 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 



segment overview 

our primary segment is our modules business which involves the design manufacture and sale of cdte solar modules which convert sunlight into electricity thirdparty customers of our modules segment include developers and operators of pv solar power systems our residual business operations include certain project development activities and om services which are primarily concentrated in japan as well as the results of operations from pv solar power systems we own and operate in certain international regions 

for the year ended december 31 2021 we changed our reportable segments to align with revisions to our internal reporting structure and longterm strategic plans following this change our modules business represents our only reportable segment we previously operated our business in two segments which included our modules and systems businesses systems business activities primarily involved i project development ii epc services and iii om services which now comprise our residual business operations and are categorized as “other” in the tables below all prior year balances were revised to conform to the current year presentation 

net sales 

we generally price and sell our solar modules on a per watt basis during 2021 sb energy accounted for more than 10 of our modules business net sales and the majority of our solar modules were sold to developers and operators of systems in the united states substantially all of our modules business net sales during 2021 were denominated in us dollars we recognize revenue for module sales at a point in time following the transfer of control of the modules to the customer which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery depending on the terms of the underlying contracts the revenue recognition policies for module sales are further described in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements net sales from our residual business operations primarily consists of revenue recognized for sales of development projects or completed systems including any modules installed in such systems and any revenue from energy generated by such systems in certain prior periods our residual business operations also included epc services we provided to third parties 

the following table shows net sales by reportable segment for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 



net sales from our modules segment increased by 5953 million in 2021 primarily due to a 48 increase in the volume of watts sold partially offset by a 10 decrease in the average selling price per watt net sales from our residual business operations decreased by 3833 million in 2021 primarily due to the sales of certain projects in japan the united states and india in the prior period and the completion of substantially all construction activities at a project in the united states in 2020 partially offset by the sales of certain projects in the united states and japan in the current period and the settlement of an outstanding indemnification arrangement associated with the sale of one of our projects under the terms of the indemnification arrangement we received 651 million for our portion of the settlement payment which we recorded as revenue during 2021 see note 13 “commitments and contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of our indemnification arrangements 

cost of sales 

our modules business cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials and components for manufacturing solar modules such as glass transparent conductive coatings cdte and other thin film semiconductors laminate materials connector assemblies edge seal materials and frames in addition our cost of sales includes direct labor for the manufacturing of solar modules and manufacturing overhead such as engineering equipment maintenance quality and production control and information technology our cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing plant and equipment facilityrelated expenses environmental health and safety costs and costs associated with shipping warranties and solar module collection and recycling excluding accretion cost of sales for our residual business operations primarily consists of projectrelated costs such as development costs legal consulting transmission upgrade interconnection permitting and other similar costs epc costs consisting primarily of solar modules inverters electrical and mounting hardware project management and engineering and construction labor and site specific costs 

the following table shows cost of sales by reportable segment for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 



cost of sales increased 1628 million or 8 and was consistent as a percent of net sales when comparing 2021 with 2020 the increase in cost of sales was driven by a 5515 million increase in our modules segment cost of sales primarily as a result of the following 

• higher costs of 6082 million from an increase in the volume of modules sold 

• higher logistics costs of 860 million 

• a reduction to our product warranty liability of 197 million in 2020 due to lowerthanexpected settlements for our older series of module technology and revisions to projected settlements resulting in a lower projected return rate 

• a reduction to our module collection and recycling liability of 189 million in 2020 due to changes to the estimated timing of cash flows associated with capital labor and maintenance costs and updates to certain valuation assumptions and 

• an increase to our module collection and recycling liability of 108 million in 2021 due to lower estimated byproduct credits for certain semiconductor materials recovered during the recycling process and updates to certain valuation assumptions partially offset by 

• continued module cost reductions which decreased cost of sales by 1608 million 

• a reduction to our product warranty liability of 331 million in 2021 due to lowerthanexpected claims for our older series of module technology as well as the evolving claims profile of our newest series of module technology resulting in reductions to our projected module return rates and 

• an impairment loss of 174 million in 2020 for certain module manufacturing equipment including framing and assembly tools which were no longer compatible with our longterm module technology roadmap 

such increase in our modules segment cost of sales was partially offset by a 3888 million decrease in our residual business operations cost of sales primarily due to the lower volume and size of projects sold and under construction during the period 

gross profit 

gross profit may be affected by numerous factors including the selling prices of our modules and the selling prices of projects and services included in our residual business operations our manufacturing costs project development costs the capacity utilization of our manufacturing facilities and foreign exchange rates gross profit may also be affected by the mix of net sales from our modules business and residual business operations 

the following table shows gross profit for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 



gross profit decreased 01 percentage points to 250 in 2021 from 251 in 2020 primarily due to a decrease in the average selling price per watt of our modules the volume of higher gross profit projects sold during the prior period and an increase in logistics costs partially offset by continued module cost reductions and the indemnification matter described above 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated costs professional fees insurance costs and other business development and selling expenses 

the following table shows selling general and administrative expense for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 



selling general and administrative expense in 2021 decreased compared to 2020 primarily due to a decrease in employee compensation expense driven by reductions in headcount from the sales of our north american om operations and us project development business higher impairment charges in the prior period for certain project assets lower expected credit losses for our accounts receivable and lower professional fees 

research and development 

research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated costs the cost of products materials and outside services used in our rd activities and depreciation and amortization expense associated with rd specific facilities and equipment we maintain a number of programs and activities to improve our technology and processes in order to enhance the performance and reduce the costs of our solar modules 

the following table shows research and development expense for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 



research and development expense in 2021 increased compared to 2020 primarily as a result of increased material and module testing costs partially offset by lower employee compensation expense resulting from reductions in rd headcount that supported our residual business operations lower sharebased compensation expense driven by the forfeiture of unvested shares by our former chief technology officer who retired effective march 15 2021 and lower impairment charges for certain equipment 

production startup 

production startup expense consists of costs associated with operating a production line before it is qualified for commercial production including the cost of raw materials for solar modules run through the production line during the qualification phase employee compensation for individuals supporting production startup activities and applicable facility related costs production startup expense also includes costs related to the selection of a new site and implementation costs for manufacturing process improvements to the extent we cannot capitalize these expenditures 

the following table shows production startup expense for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 



during 2021 we incurred production startup expense primarily for the transition to series 6 module manufacturing at our second facility in kulim malaysia which commenced commercial production in early 2021 and for certain manufacturing upgrades at our malaysian facilities during 2020 we incurred production startup expense for the transition to series 6 module manufacturing at our second facility in kulim malaysia and the capacity expansion of our manufacturing facility in perrysburg ohio 

litigation loss 

the following table shows litigation loss for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 



in june 2020 we entered into an agreement in principle to settle certain claims filed in 2015 in the united states district court for the district of arizona hereafter “arizona district court” by putative stockholders that opted out of our previously settled class action lawsuit the “optout action” in july 2020 the parties executed a definitive settlement agreement pursuant to which we agreed to pay a total of 19 million in exchange for mutual releases and a dismissal with prejudice of the optout action the agreement contains no admission of liability wrongdoing or responsibility by any of the defendants in july 2020 first solar funded the settlement and the parties filed a joint stipulation of dismissal in september 2020 the arizona district court entered an order dismissing the case with prejudice as of december 31 2019 we had accrued 13 million of estimated losses for this action as a result of the settlement we accrued an incremental 6 million litigation loss during 2020 see note 13 “commitments and contingencies – legal proceedings” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on this matter 

gain on sales of businesses net 

the following table shows gain on sales of businesses net for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 



in august 2020 we entered into an agreement with a subsidiary of clairvest for the sale of our north american om operations on march 31 2021 we completed the transaction following certain customary postclosing adjustments we received total consideration of 1491 million as a result of this transaction we recorded a gain of 1158 million net of transaction costs and postclosing adjustments 

in january 2021 we entered into an agreement with leeward for the sale of our us project development business on march 31 2021 we completed the transaction for an aggregate purchase price of 2840 million such purchase price included 1514 million for the sale of the us project development business and 1326 million for the sale of 392 mw dc of solar modules which is presented in “net sales” on our consolidated statements of operations as a 

result of this transaction we recognized a gain of 315 million net of transaction costs and postclosing adjustments 

see note 3 “sales of businesses” to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to these transactions 

foreign currency loss income net 

foreign currency loss income net consists of the net effect of gains and losses resulting from holding assets and liabilities and conducting transactions denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries’ functional currencies 

the following table shows foreign currency loss income net for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 



foreign currency loss increased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to higher costs associated with hedging activities related to our subsidiaries in japan and india and differences between our economic hedge positions and the underlying exposures 

interest income 

interest income is earned on our cash cash equivalents marketable securities restricted cash and restricted marketable securities interest income also includes interest earned from late customer payments 

the following table shows interest income for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 



interest income during 2021 decreased compared to 2020 primarily due to lower interest rates on marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents and lower average balances associated with marketable securities 

interest expense net 

interest expense net is primarily comprised of interest incurred on longterm debt settlements of interest rate swap contracts and changes in the fair value of interest rate swap contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 815 we may capitalize interest expense to our project assets or property plant and equipment when such costs qualify for interest capitalization which reduces the amount of net interest expense reported in any given period 

the following table shows interest expense net for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 



interest expense net in 2021 decreased compared to 2020 primarily due to unfavorable changes in the fair value of interest rate swap contracts in the prior period which did not qualify for hedge accounting lower interest expense associated with project debt and lower amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs in the current period primarily driven by the repayment of the ishikawa credit agreement in the prior period 

other income expense net 

other income expense net is primarily comprised of miscellaneous items and realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities and restricted marketable securities 

the following table shows other income expense net for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 



other income net increased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to expected credit losses associated with certain notes receivable in the prior period partially offset by lower realized gains from sales of restricted marketable securities in the current period when compared to the prior period 

income tax expense benefit 

income tax expense or benefit deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect our best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which we operate principally japan malaysia and vietnam significant judgments and estimates are required to determine our consolidated income tax expense the statutory federal corporate income tax rate in the united states is 21 and the tax rates in japan malaysia and vietnam are 306 24 and 20 respectively in malaysia we have been granted a longterm tax holiday scheduled to expire in 2027 pursuant to which substantially all of our income earned in malaysia is exempt from income tax conditional upon our continued compliance with certain employment and investment thresholds in vietnam we have been granted a tax incentive scheduled to expire at the end of 2025 pursuant to which income earned in vietnam is subject to reduced annual tax rates 

the following table shows income tax expense benefit for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 



our tax rate is affected by recurring items such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions the rate is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from period to period income tax expense increased by 2108 million during 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to a tax benefit in the prior year from the effect of tax law changes associated with the cares act the prior year reversal of uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statute of limitations higher pretax income in the current year and the prior year release of the valuation allowance associated with our vietnamese subsidiary due to its prior year operating income 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2021 we believe that our cash cash equivalents marketable securities cash flows from operating activities and contracts with customers for the future sale of solar modules will be sufficient to meet our working capital capital expenditure and project asset investment needs for at least the next 12 months as necessary we also believe we will have adequate access to the capital markets we monitor our working capital to ensure we have adequate liquidity both domestically and internationally we intend to maintain appropriate debt levels based upon cash flow expectations our overall cost of capital and expected cash requirements for operations such as construction activities and purchases of manufacturing equipment for our recently announced manufacturing facility in india and ongoing development activities for certain projects in japan however our ability to raise capital on terms commercially acceptable to us could be constrained if there is insufficient lender or investor interest due to companyspecific industrywide or broader market concerns any incremental debt financings could result in increased debt service expenses andor restrictive covenants which could limit our ability to pursue our strategic plans additionally given the duration of these and other capital investments and the currency risk relative to the us dollar in certain international markets in which we operate we continue to explore local financing alternatives should these financing alternatives be unavailable or too cost prohibitive we could be exposed to significant currency risk and our liquidity could be adversely impacted 

as of december 31 2021 we had 18 billion in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities compared to 17 billion as of december 31 2020 the increase in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities was primarily driven by cash receipts from module sales to customers cash proceeds from the sale of our north american om operations and us project development business and cash proceeds from the sale and prior period construction of certain projects in the united states and japan partially offset by purchases of property plant and equipment and other operating expenditures as of december 31 2021 and 2020 08 billion and 11 billion respectively of our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries and was primarily based in us dollar japanese yen and indian rupee denominated holdings 

we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed if certain international funds were needed for our operations in the united states we may be required to accrue and pay certain us and foreign taxes to repatriate such funds we maintain the intent and ability to permanently reinvest our accumulated earnings outside the united states with the exception of our subsidiaries in canada and germany in addition changes to foreign government banking regulations may restrict our ability to move funds among various jurisdictions under certain circumstances which could negatively impact our access to capital resulting in an adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources 

we continually evaluate forecasted global demand and seek to balance our manufacturing capacity with such demand we recently announced our plans to invest approximately 14 billion to expand our solar manufacturing capacity by 66 gw dc by constructing our third manufacturing facility in the us and our first manufacturing facility in india these new facilities are expected to commence operations in the first half of 2023 and the second half of 2023 respectively in addition we continue to increase the nameplate production capacity of our existing manufacturing facilities by improving our production throughput increasing module wattage or conversion efficiency and improving manufacturing yield losses during 2022 we expect to spend 09 billion to 11 billion for capital expenditures including the new facilities mentioned above and upgrades to machinery and equipment that we believe will further increase our module wattage and expand capacity and throughput at our manufacturing facilities 

we also expect to commit significant working capital to purchase various raw materials used in our module manufacturing process our failure to obtain raw materials and components that meet our quality quantity and cost requirements in a timely manner could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture our solar modules or increase our manufacturing costs accordingly we may enter into longterm supply agreements to mitigate potential risks related to the procurement of key raw materials and components and such agreements may be noncancelable or cancelable with a significant penalty for example we have entered into longterm supply agreements for the purchase of certain specified minimum volumes of substrate glass and cover glass for our pv solar modules our remaining purchases under these supply agreements are expected to be approximately 17 billion of substrate glass and approximately 369 million of cover glass we have the right to terminate these agreements upon payment of specified termination penalties which in aggregate are up to 322 million as of december 31 2021 and decline over the remaining supply periods 

we have also committed certain financial resources to fulfill our solar module collection and recycling obligations and have established a trust under which these funds are put into custodial accounts with an established and reputable bank as of december 31 2021 such funds were comprised of restricted marketable securities of 2447 million and restricted cash balances of 09 million as of december 31 2021 our module collection and recycling liability was 1391 million trust funds may be disbursed for qualified module collection and recycling costs including capital and facility related recycling costs payments to customers for assuming collection and recycling obligations and reimbursements of any overfunded amounts investments in the trust must meet certain investment quality criteria comparable to highly rated government or agency bonds as necessary we adjust the funded amounts for our estimated collection and recycling obligations on an annual basis based on the estimated costs of collecting and recycling covered modules estimated rates of return on our restricted marketable securities and an estimated solar module life of 25 years less amounts already funded in prior years 

our residual business operations include certain project development activities and om services which are primarily concentrated in japan solar power project development cycles which span the time between the identification of a site location and the commercial operation of a system vary substantially and can take many years to mature as a result of these long project cycles and strategic decisions to finance the development of certain projects using our working capital we may need to make significant investments of resources in advance of the receipt of any cash from the sale of such projects in late 2021 we received an offer to purchase our project development and om services businesses in japan and determined it was in the best interest of our stockholders to pursue this transaction as a result we expect to complete the sale of these businesses in the first half of 2022 to the extent the sale is not completed in the near term our residual business operations may continue to have significant liquidity requirements in the future for project development and construction costs commitments under land lease arrangements associated with project sites and commitments under certain project debt arrangements the net amount of our project assets and related portions of longterm debt and deferred revenue which approximates our net capital investment in the development and construction of solar power projects was 2412 million as of december 31 2021 additionally from time to time we have elected to retain an ownership interest in certain pv solar power systems after they became operational the decision to retain ownership of a system impacts our liquidity depending upon the size and cost of the project the net amount of our pv solar power systems and related portions of longterm debt which approximates our net capital investment in our operating power plants was 335 million as of december 31 2021 

as of december 31 2021 we had no offbalance sheet debt or similar obligations other than financial assurance related instruments which are not classified as debt we do not guarantee any thirdparty debt see note 13 “commitments and contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements for further information about our financial assurance related instruments 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes key cash flow activity for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 in thousands 



operating activities 

the increase in net cash provided by operating activities during 2021 was primarily driven by the 350 million settlement payment in 2020 associated with our prior class action lawsuit and higher cash receipts from module sales partially offset by lower cash proceeds from sales of project assets in the current year 

investing activities 

the decrease in net cash used in investing activities during 2021 was primarily due to proceeds from the sale of our north american om operations and us project development business partially offset by lower net sales and maturities of marketable securities and restricted marketable securities and higher purchases of property plant and equipment 

financing activities 

the increase in net cash provided by financing activities during 2021 was primarily due to higher net borrowings under project specific debt financings associated with the construction of certain projects in japan 

recent accounting pronouncements 

none 

critical accounting estimates 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “us gaap” we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of reported assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment in the selection of the appropriate assumptions for making these estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty we base our judgments and estimates on our historical experience our forecasts and other available information as appropriate the actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results our future results of operations will be affected our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements the accounting policies that require the most significant judgment and estimates include the following 

accrued solar module collection and recycling liability we previously established a module collection and recycling program which has since been discontinued to collect and recycle modules sold and covered under such program once the modules reach the end of their service lives for legacy customer sales contracts that were covered under this program we recognized expense at the time of sale for the estimated cost of our obligations to collect and 

recycle such modules we estimate the cost of our collection and recycling obligations based on the present value of the expected future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules which includes estimates for the cost of packaging materials the cost of freight from the solar module installation sites to a recycling center material labor and capital costs and byproduct credits for certain materials recovered during the recycling process we base these estimates on our experience collecting and recycling solar modules and certain assumptions regarding the estimated useful lives of modules covered by the program and the number of modules expected to be recycled in the periods between the time of sale and the related settlement of the collection and recycling obligation we accrete the carrying amount of the associated liability and classify the corresponding expense within “selling general and administrative” expense on our consolidated statements of operations we periodically review our estimates of expected future recycling costs and may adjust our liability accordingly during the year ended december 31 2021 we completed our annual cost study of obligations under our module collection and recycling program and increased the associated liability by 108 million primarily due to lower estimated byproduct credits for certain semiconductor materials recovered during the recycling process and updates to certain valuation assumptions as of december 31 2021 a 10 increase in the expected future recycling costs would increase the liability by 139 million 

product warranties we provide a limited pv solar module warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for up to 12 years we also typically warrant that modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 98 of their labeled power output rating during the first year with the warranty coverage reducing by a degradation factor every year thereafter throughout the limited power output warranty period of up to 30 years among other things our solar module warranty also covers the resulting power output loss from cell cracking 

as an alternative form of our standard limited module power output warranty we have also offered an aggregated or systemlevel limited module performance warranty this systemlevel limited module performance warranty is designed for utilityscale systems and provides 25year systemlevel energy degradation protection this warranty represents a practical expedient to address the challenge of identifying from the potential millions of modules installed in a utilityscale system individual modules that may be performing below warranty thresholds by focusing on the aggregate energy generated by the system rather than the power output of individual modules the systemlevel limited module performance warranty is typically calculated as a percentage of a system’s expected energy production adjusted for certain actual site conditions with the warranted level of performance declining each year in a linear fashion but never falling below 80 during the term of the warranty 

in addition to our limited solar module warranties described above for pv solar power systems we have constructed we have provided limited warranties for defects in engineering design installation and bos part workmanship for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a system or a block within the system 

when we recognize revenue for sales of modules or projects we accrue liabilities for the estimated future costs of meeting our limited warranty obligations we make and revise these estimates based primarily on the number of solar modules under warranty installed at customer locations our historical experience with and projections of warranty claims and our estimated permodule replacement costs we also monitor our expected future module performance through certain quality and reliability testing and actual performance in certain field installation sites during the year ended december 31 2021 we revised this estimate based on updated information regarding our warranty claims which reduced our product warranty liability by 331 million this updated information reflected lowerthanexpected warranty claims for our older series of module technology as well as the evolving claims profile of our newest series of module technology resulting in reductions to our projected module return rates in general we expect the return rates for our series 6 modules to be lower than our older series and we estimate that the return rate for such newer series of module technology will be less than 1 as of december 31 2021 a 1 increase in the return rate across all series of module technology would increase our product warranty liability by 1196 million and a 1 increase in the return rate for bos parts would not have a material impact on the associated warranty liability 

income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the united states its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations such tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant taxing authorities we make judgments and interpretations regarding the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining our provision for income taxes and also make estimates about when in the future certain items are expected to affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions disputes over interpretations of tax laws may be settled with the relevant taxing authority upon examination or audit we regularly evaluate the likelihood of assessments in each of our taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and future examinations and we record tax liabilities as appropriate 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements we calculate our income tax provision based on our interpretation of the tax laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business this requires us to estimate our current tax obligations evaluate our ability and intent to permanently reinvest our accumulated earnings in jurisdictions outside the united states assess uncertain tax positions and assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities we must also assess the likelihood that each of our deferred tax assets will be realized to the extent we believe that realization of any of our deferred tax assets is not more likely than not we establish a valuation allowance when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a reporting period we generally record a corresponding tax expense conversely to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed which generally reduces our overall income tax expense 

we establish liabilities for potential additional taxes based on our assessment of the outcome of our tax positions once established we adjust these liabilities when additional information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring an adjustment significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the actual cost of a tax assessment fine or penalty may ultimately be materially different from our recorded liabilities if any 

we continually explore initiatives to better align our tax and legal entity structure with the footprint of our global operations and recognize the tax impact of these initiatives including changes in the assessment of uncertain tax positions indefinite reinvestment exception assertions and the realizability of deferred tax assets in the period when we believe all necessary internal and external approvals associated with such initiatives have been obtained or when the initiatives are materially complete 

asset impairments we assess longlived assets classified as “held and used” including our property plant and equipment pv solar power systems project assets operating lease assets and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances arise including consideration of technological obsolescence that may indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable and these assessments require significant judgment in determining whether such events or changes have occurred these events or changes in circumstances may include a significant decrease in the market price of a longlived asset a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset is being used or in its physical condition a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of a longlived asset an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a longlived asset a currentperiod operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of such losses or a projection of future losses associated with the use of a longlived asset or a current expectation that more likely than not a longlived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss longlived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and we must also exercise judgment in assessing such groupings and levels 

when impairment indicators are present we compare undiscounted future cash flows including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value to the asset group’s carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset group to its carrying value fair value is generally determined 

by considering i internally developed discounted cash flows for the asset group ii thirdparty valuations andor iii information available regarding the current market value for such assets if the fair value of an asset group is determined to be less than its carrying value an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and such projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency exchange risk 

cash flow exposure we expect certain of our subsidiaries to have future cash flows that will be denominated in currencies other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies changes in the exchange rates between the functional currencies of our subsidiaries and the other currencies in which they transact will cause fluctuations in the cash flows we expect to receive or pay when these cash flows are realized or settled accordingly we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of these forecasted cash flows these foreign exchange forward contracts qualify for accounting as cash flow hedges in accordance with asc 815 and we designated them as such we initially report unrealized gains or losses for such contracts in “accumulated other comprehensive loss” and subsequently reclassify amounts into earnings when the hedged transaction occurs and impacts earnings for additional details on our derivative hedging instruments and activities see note 8 “derivative financial instruments” to our consolidated financial statements 

certain of our international operations such as our manufacturing facilities in malaysia and vietnam pay a portion of their operating expenses including associate wages and utilities in local currencies which exposes us to foreign currency exchange risk for such expenses our manufacturing facilities are also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk for purchases of certain equipment from international vendors to the extent we expand into new markets particularly emerging markets our total foreign currency exchange risk in terms of both size and exchange rate volatility and the number of foreign currencies we are exposed to could increase significantly 

for the year ended december 31 2021 11 of our net sales were denominated in foreign currencies including japanese yen and euro as a result we have exposure to foreign currencies with respect to our net sales which has historically represented one of our primary foreign currency exchange risks a 10 change in the us dollar to japanese yen and euro exchange rates would have had an aggregate impact on our net sales of 295 million excluding the effect of our hedging activities 

transaction exposure many of our subsidiaries have assets and liabilities primarily cash receivables deferred taxes payables accrued expenses and solar module collection and recycling liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies changes in the exchange rates between the functional currencies of our subsidiaries and the other currencies in which these assets and liabilities are denominated will create fluctuations in our reported consolidated statements of operations and cash flows we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other financial instruments to economically hedge assets and liabilities against the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations the gains and losses on such foreign exchange forward contracts will economically offset all or part of the transaction gains and losses that we recognize in earnings on the related foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities for additional details on our economic hedging instruments and activities see note 8 “derivative financial instruments” to our consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2021 a 10 change in the us dollar relative to our primary foreign currency exposures would not have had a significant impact to our net foreign currency income or loss including the effect of our hedging activities 

interest rate risk 

variable rate debt exposure we are exposed to interest rate risk as certain of our project specific debt financings have variable interest rates exposing us to variability in interest expense and cash flows see note 12 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our longterm debt borrowing rates an increase in relevant interest rates would increase the cost of borrowing under certain of our project specific debt financings if such variable interest rates changed by 100 basis points our interest expense for the year ended december 31 2021 would have changed by 13 million including the effect of our hedging activities 

customer financing exposure we are also indirectly exposed to interest rate risk because many of our customers depend on debt financings to purchase modules an increase in interest rates could make it challenging for our customers to obtain the capital necessary to make such purchases on favorable terms or at all such factors could reduce demand or lower the price we can charge for our modules thereby reducing our net sales and gross profit 

marketable securities and restricted marketable securities exposure we invest in various debt securities which exposes us to interest rate risk the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal and provide liquidity while at the same time maximizing the return on our investments many of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk accordingly a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the market value of such investments to fluctuate for example if we hold a security that was issued with an interest rate fixed at the thenprevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate subsequently rises the market value of our investment may decline 

for the year ended december 31 2021 our marketable securities earned a return of less than 1 including the impact of fluctuations in the price of the underlying securities and had a weightedaverage maturity of 5 months as of the end of the period based on our investment positions as of december 31 2021 a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would have resulted in a 09 million change in the market value of our investment portfolio for the year ended december 31 2021 our restricted marketable securities incurred a loss of 7 including the impact of fluctuations in the price of the underlying securities and had a weightedaverage maturity of approximately 14 years as of the end of the period based on our restricted marketable securities positions as of december 31 2021 a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would have resulted in a 237 million change in the market value of our restricted marketable securities portfolio 

commodity and component risk 

we are exposed to price risks for the raw materials components logistics services and energy costs used in the manufacturing and transportation of our solar modules additionally some of our raw materials and components are sourced from a limited number of suppliers or a single supplier we evaluate our suppliers using a robust qualification process in some cases we also enter into longterm supply contracts for raw materials and components accordingly we are exposed to price changes in the raw materials and components used in our solar modules from time to time we may utilize derivative hedging instruments to mitigate such raw material price changes in addition the failure of a key supplier could disrupt our supply chain which could result in higher prices andor a disruption in our manufacturing process we may be unable to pass along changes in the costs of the raw materials and components for our modules or the costs associated with logistics services for the distribution of our modules to our customers and may be in default of our delivery obligations if we experience a manufacturing disruption 

credit risk 

we have certain financial and derivative instruments that subject us to credit risk these consist primarily of cash cash equivalents marketable securities accounts receivable restricted cash restricted marketable securities and foreign exchange forward contracts we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial and derivative instruments we place these instruments with various highquality 

financial institutions and limit the amount of credit risk from any one counterparty we continuously evaluate the credit standing of our counterparty financial institutions we monitor the financial condition of our customers and perform credit evaluations whenever considered necessary depending upon the sales arrangement we may require some form of payment security from our customers including but not limited to advance payments parent guarantees letters of credit bank guarantees or surety bonds

 item 1 business 

company overview 

we are a leading global provider of pv solar energy solutions we design manufacture and sell pv solar modules with an advanced thin film semiconductor technology in certain markets we also develop and sell pv solar power systems that primarily use the modules we manufacture and provide operations and maintenance “om” services to system owners we have substantial ongoing rd efforts focused on various technology innovations we are the world’s largest thin film pv solar module manufacturer and the largest pv solar module manufacturer in the western hemisphere 

in addressing the overall global demand for electricity our cdte modules which leverage our series 6 tm “series 6” module technology compete favorably on an economic basis with traditional forms of energy generation and provide low cost electricity to end users our diverse capabilities facilitate the sale of these solutions and the adoption of our technology in key markets around the world we believe our strategies and points of differentiation provide the foundation for our competitive position and enable us to remain one of the preferred providers of pv solar modules 

business strategy 

differentiated technology 

as a fieldproven technology our cdte solar modules offer certain advantages over conventional crystalline silicon solar modules by delivering competitive efficiency higher realworld energy yield and longterm reliability proven to deliver up to 8 more usable energy per nameplate watt than crystalline silicon technologies in certain geographic markets and with a record of reliable system performance our cdte technology delivers more energy over the lifetime of a pv solar power system our series 6 module technology with its combination of high wattage low manufacturing costs and balance of systems “bos” component compatibility has further enhanced our competitive position since the launch of such technology in 2018 

in terms of energy yield in many climates our cdte solar modules provide an energy production advantage over crystalline silicon solar modules of equivalent efficiency rating for example our cdte solar modules provide a superior temperature coefficient which results in stronger system performance in typical high insolation climates as the majority of a system’s generation on average occurs when module temperatures are well above 25°c standard test conditions in addition our cdte solar modules provide a superior spectral response in humid environments where atmospheric moisture alters the solar spectrum relative to laboratory standards our cdte solar modules also provide a better partial shading response than conventional crystalline silicon solar modules which may experience significantly lower energy generation than cdte solar modules when partial shading occurs as a result of these and other factors our pv solar modules typically produce more annual energy in real world field conditions than conventional modules with the same nameplate capacity furthermore our thinfilm cdte semiconductor technology is immune to cell cracking and its resulting power output loss a common failure often observed in crystalline silicon modules caused by poor manufacturing handling weather or other conditions 

manufacturing process 

our modules are manufactured in a highthroughput automated environment that integrates all manufacturing steps into a continuous flow line such manufacturing process eliminates the multiple supply chain operators and resourceintensive batch processing steps that are used to produce crystalline silicon solar modules which typically occur over several days and across multiple factories at the outset of the production of our modules a sheet of glass enters the production line and in a matter of hours is transformed into a completed module which is flash tested 

packaged and ready for shipment with more than 30 gw dc of modules sold worldwide we have a demonstrated history of manufacturing success and innovation we have a global manufacturing footprint with facilities based in the united states malaysia and vietnam 

diversified capabilities 

we are diversified across the solar value chain many of the efficiencies and capabilities that we deliver to our customers are not easily replicable for other industry participants that are not diversified in a similar manner accordingly our operational model offers pv solar energy solutions that benefit from our wide range of capabilities including advanced pv solar module manufacturing and in certain markets project development construction management services and om services 

financial viability 

we are committed to creating longterm shareholder value through a decisionmaking framework that delivers a balance of growth profitability and liquidity this framework has enabled us to fund our series 6 manufacturing and capacity expansion initiatives using cash flows generated by our operations despite substantial downward pressure on the price of solar modules and systems due to competition demand fluctuations and significant overcapacity in the industry our financial viability provides strategic optionality as we evaluate how to invest in our business and generate returns for our shareholders our financial viability and bankability also enable us to offer meaningful warranties which provide us with a competitive advantage relative to many of our peers in the solar industry in the context of project financing and offering pv solar energy solutions to longterm owners furthermore we expect our financial discipline and ability to manage operating costs to enhance our profitability as we continue to scale our business 

sustainability 

in addition to our financial commitments we are also committed to minimizing the environmental impacts and enhancing the social and economic benefits of our products across their life cycle from raw material sourcing through endoflife module recycling our thin film modules are manufactured in a highthroughput automated environment that integrates all manufacturing steps into a continuousflow operation using less energy water and semiconductor material than conventional crystalline silicon accordingly our modules and systems provide an ecologically leading solution to climate change energy security and water scarcity which also enables our customers to achieve their sustainability objectives on a lifecycle basis our thin film module technology has the fastest energy payback time smallest carbon footprint and lowest water use of any pv solar technology on the market 

the energy payback time which is the amount of time a system must operate to recover the energy required to produce it of our module technology is facilitated by our specialized manufacturing process in less than six months under high irradiance conditions our systems produce more energy than was required to create them this energy payback time represents a 50fold energy return on investment over a theoretical 25year system lifetime and an abundant net energy gain to the electricity grid furthermore our module technology displaces up to 98 of greenhouse gas emissions and other air pollutants when replacing traditional forms of energy generation our modules also use up to 400 times less water per mw hour than conventional energy sources and up to 24 times less water than other pv solar modules in addition our industryleading recycling process further enhances our sustainability advantage by recovering approximately 90 of the glass for reuse in new glass products and over 90 of the semiconductor material for reuse in new modules during 2020 our series 6 modules became the world’s first pv product to be included in the electronic products environmental assessment tool “epeat” registry’s photovoltaic and inverters product category the epeat registry enables the identification of credible sustainable electronic products from a broad range of manufacturers based on several factors including the product’s raw materials manufacturing energy water use product packaging endoflife recycling and corporate responsibility

market overview 

solar energy is one of the fastest growing forms of renewable energy with numerous economic and environmental benefits that make it an attractive complement to andor substitute for traditional forms of energy generation in recent years the price of pv solar power systems and accordingly the cost of producing electricity from such systems has dropped to levels that are competitive with or below the wholesale price of electricity in many markets this rapid price decline has opened new possibilities to develop systems in many locations with limited or no financial incentives other technological developments in the industry such as the advancement of energy storage capabilities have further enhanced the prospects of solar energy as an alternative to traditional forms of energy generation furthermore the fact that a pv solar power system requires no fuel provides a unique and valuable hedging benefit to owners of such systems relative to traditional energy generation assets once installed pv solar power systems can function for over 35 years with relatively less maintenance or oversight compared to many other forms of generation in addition to these economic benefits solar energy has substantial environmental benefits for example pv solar power systems generate no greenhouse gas or other emissions and use minimal amounts of water compared to traditional energy generation assets worldwide solar markets continue to develop aided by the above factors as well as demand elasticity resulting from declining industry average selling prices both at the module and system level which have made solar power one of the most economically attractive sources of energy 

module average selling prices in many global markets have declined in recent years and are expected to continue to decline to some degree in the future in the aggregate we believe manufacturers of solar cells and modules have significant installed production capacity relative to global demand and the ability for additional capacity expansion we believe the solar industry may from time to time experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity exceeds global demand and that such periods will continue to put pressure on pricing additionally intense competition at the system level may result in an environment in which pricing falls rapidly thereby further increasing demand for solar energy solutions but constraining the ability for project developers and diversified module manufacturers to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability in light of such market realities we are focusing on our strategies and points of differentiation which include our advanced module technology our manufacturing process our diversified capabilities our financial viability and the sustainability advantage of our modules and systems 

global markets 

we have established and continue to develop a global business presence energy markets are by their nature localized with different drivers and market forces impacting electricity generation and demand in a particular region or for a particular application accordingly our business is evolving worldwide and is shaped by the varying ways in which our offerings can be compelling and economically viable solutions to energy needs in various markets due to the covid19 pandemic market growth in certain geographies in which we operate has slowed for a detailed discussion of the impact of and potential risks arising from the covid19 pandemic on our business see item 1a “risk factors – the covid19 pandemic could materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations” 

we are currently focusing on markets including those listed below in which our cdte solar modules provide certain advantages over conventional crystalline silicon solar modules including high insolation climates in which our modules provide a superior temperature coefficient humid environments in which our modules provide a superior spectral response and markets that favor the superior sustainability profile of our pv solar technology to the extent our production capacity expands in future periods we have the potential to extend our focus to additional geographic markets 

united states multiple markets within the united states which accounted for 68 of our 2020 net sales exemplify favorable characteristics for a solar market including i sizeable electricity demand particularly around growing population centers and industrial areas ii strong demand for renewable energy generation and iii abundant solar resources in those areas and applications in which these factors are more pronounced our pv solar energy solutions 

compete favorably on an economic basis with traditional forms of energy generation the market penetration of pv solar is also impacted by certain federal and state support programs including the federal investment tax credit as described below under “support programs” 

japan japan’s electricity markets have various characteristics which make them attractive markets for pv solar energy in particular japan has few domestic fossil fuel resources and relies heavily on fossil fuel imports following the fukushima earthquake in 2011 the country introduced certain initiatives to limit its reliance on nuclear power accordingly the japanese government announced a longterm goal of dramatically increasing installed solar power capacity and provided various incentives for solar power installations in recent years we have partnered with local companies to develop construct sell and operate various pv solar power systems which are expected to mitigate japan’s dependence on fossil fuel imports and nuclear power in 2020 we completed the sale of multiple projects in japan totaling 116 mw ac and expect to continue providing om services to such projects in the future we continue to pursue other utilityscale project development om and module sale opportunities in the country 

europe  most markets across europe reflect strong demand for pv solar energy due to its ability to compete economically with more traditional forms of energy generation in particular france germany greece italy the netherlands portugal and spain are all running tenders in which utilityscale pv solar projects can bid for capacity such tenders and other recent market developments indicate the potential for further growth in the demand for pv solar energy beyond the region’s installed generation capacity of approximately 135 gw dc  due to the covid19 pandemic the market growth in europe has slowed and the utilityscale market has experienced some delays in both tenders and installations we continue to pursue module sales activities in many of the countries mentioned above 

india india continues to represent one of the largest and fastest growing markets for pv solar energy with an installed generation capacity of over 36 gw dc and over 20 gw dc of new procurement programs announced in addition the government has established aggressive renewable energy targets which include increasing the country’s solar capacity to 100 gw ac by 2022 and the overall renewable energy target of 450 gw dc of installed capacity by 2030 these targets along with various policy and regulatory measures help create significant and sustained demand for pv solar energy accordingly we expect to continue selling modules to market participants to address the region’s energy needs in 2020 we completed the sale of our anantapur and tungabhadra projects located in telangana and karnataka respectively which total 40 mw ac  in addition we continue to maintain our strong module presence in india with approximately 2 gw dc of installed modules 

support programs 

although we compete in many markets that do not require solarspecific government subsidies or support programs our net sales and profits remain subject in the near term to variability based on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives such as quotas renewable portfolio standards and tendering systems in addition to these support programs financial incentives for pv solar energy generation may include tax and production incentives additionally to address the nearterm business disruption caused by the covid19 pandemic many governments have proposed policies or support programs intended to stimulate their respective economies such support programs may include additional incentives for renewable energy projects including pv solar power systems over several years although we expect to become less impacted by and less dependent on these forms of government support over time such programs continue to influence the demand for pv solar energy around the world 

in europe renewable energy targets in conjunction with tenders for utilityscale pv solar and other support measures have contributed to growth in pv solar markets renewable energy targets prescribe how much energy consumption must come from renewable sources while incentive policies and competitive tender policies are intended to support new supply development by providing certainty to investors various european union 

“eu” directives on renewable energy have set targets for all eu member states in support of the recently revised goal of a 55 share of energy from renewable sources in the eu by 2030 

tax incentive programs exist in the united states at both the federal and state level and can take the form of investment and production tax credits accelerated depreciation and sales and property tax exemptions and abatements at the federal level investment tax credits for business and residential solar systems have gone through several cycles of enactment and expiration since the 1980s in 2015 the us congress extended the 30 federal energy investment tax credit “itc” for both residential and commercial solar installations through 2019 among other requirements such credits require projects to have commenced construction by a certain date which may be achieved by certain qualifying procurement activities accordingly projects that commenced construction in 2019 were eligible for the 30 itc the itc stepped down to 26 for projects that commenced construction in 2020 in december 2020 the us congress extended the 26 itc through 2022 as part of its covid19 relief efforts as a result of this extension the itc will step down to 22 for projects that commence construction in 2023 and 10 for projects that commence construction thereafter the itc has been an important economic driver of solar installations and qualifying procurement activities in the united states and its extension has contributed to greater mediumterm demand the positive impact of the itc depends to a large degree on the availability of tax equity for project financing and any significant reduction in the availability of tax equity in the future could make it more difficult to develop and construct projects requiring financing 

the majority of states in the united states have also enacted legislation adopting renewable portfolio standard “rps” mechanisms under an rps regulated utilities and other load serving entities are required to procure a specified percentage of their total retail electricity sales to enduser customers from eligible renewable resources such as solar energy generation facilities by a specified date some programs may further require that a specified portion of the total percentage of renewable energy must come from solar generation facilities or other technologies rps mechanisms and other legislation vary significantly from state to state particularly with respect to the percentage of renewable energy required to achieve the state’s rps the definition of eligible renewable energy resources and the extent to which renewable energy credits qualify for rps compliance 

measured in terms of the volume of renewable electricity required to meet its rps mandate california’s rps program is one of the most significant in the united states in addition to serving as a template for other states the california market for renewable energy has historically been a key region for first solar and has led the western united states in renewable energy demand for the past several years first enacted in 2002 california’s rps statute has been amended several times to increase the overall percentage requirement as well as to accelerate the target date for program compliance pursuant to the passage of sb100 by the california legislature in 2018 the california rps program requires utilities and other obligated load serving entities to procure 60 of their total retail electricity demand from eligible renewable resources by 2030 and 100 of such electricity demand from carbonfree resources by 2045 

various proposed and contemplated environmental and tax policies may create regulatory uncertainty in the renewable energy sector including the solar energy sector and may lead to a reduction or removal of various clean energy programs and initiatives designed to curtail climate change for more information about the risks associated with these potential government actions see item 1a “risk factors – the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives tax incentives renewable energy targets and other support for ongrid solar electricity applications or other public policies such as tariffs or other trade remedies imposed on solar cells and modules could negatively impact demand andor price levels for our solar modules and systems and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales or increase our costs thereby adversely impacting our operating results” 

business segments 

we operate our business in two segments our modules segment involves the design manufacture and sale of cdte solar modules which convert sunlight into electricity thirdparty customers of our modules segment include integrators and operators of pv solar power systems our second segment is our systems segment through which we provide power plant solutions in certain markets which include i project development ii engineering procurement and construction “epc” services and iii om services we may provide any combination of individual products and services within such capabilities including with respect to epc services by contracting with third parties depending upon the customer and market opportunity our systems segment customers include utilities independent power producers commercial and industrial companies and other system owners as part of our systems segment we may also temporarily own and operate certain of our systems for a period of time based on strategic opportunities or market factors see note 20 “segment and geographical information” to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our business segments 

modules business 

solar modules 

since the inception of first solar our flagship module has used our advanced thin film semiconductor technology in april 2018 we commenced commercial production of our series 6 module technology which represents the latest generation of our flagship module each series 6 module is a glass laminate approximately 4ft x 6ft 123cm x 201cm in size that encapsulates thin film semiconductor materials at the end of 2020 our series 6 modules had an average power output of 439 watts our modules offer up to 8 more energy than certain crystalline silicon solar modules of equivalent nameplate capacity and generally include antireflective coated glass which enhances energy production our module semiconductor structure is a singlejunction polycrystalline thin film that uses cdte as the absorption layer cdte has absorption properties that are well matched to the solar spectrum and can deliver competitive wattage using approximately 12 of the amount of semiconductor material used to manufacture conventional crystalline silicon modules due to its minimal thickness our thinfilm cdte semiconductor technology is also immune to cell cracking and its resulting power output loss a common failure often observed in crystalline silicon modules caused by poor manufacturing handling weather or other conditions 

manufacturing process 

we manufacture our solar modules on integrated production lines in an automated proprietary and continuous process which includes the following three stages i the deposition stage ii the cell definition and treatment stage and iii the assembly and test stage in the deposition stage panels of transparent oxidecoated glass are robotically loaded onto the production line where they are cleaned lasermark identified with a serial number heated and coated with thin layers of cdte and other semiconductor materials using our proprietary vapor transport deposition technology after which the semiconductorcoated plates are cooled rapidly to increase glass strength in the cell definition and treatment stage we use highspeed lasers to transform the large continuous semiconductor coating on the glass plate into a series of interconnected cells that deliver the desired current and voltage output in this stage we also treat the semiconductor film using proprietary chemistries and processes to improve the device’s performance and we apply a metal sputtered back contact in the assembly and test stage we apply busbars interlayer material and a rear glass cover sheet that is laminated to encapsulate the device we then apply antireflective coating material to the substrate glass to further improve the module’s performance by increasing its ability to absorb sunlight finally junction boxes termination wires and an undermount frame are applied to complete the assembly 

we maintain a robust quality and reliability assurance program that monitors critical process parameters and measures product performance to ensure that industry and more stringent internal standards are met we also conduct acceptance testing for electrical leakage visual quality and power measurement on a solar simulator prior to preparing a module for shipment the quality and reliability tests complement production surveillance with an 

ongoing monitoring program subjecting production modules to accelerated life stress testing to help ensure ongoing conformance to requirements of the international electrotechnical commission and underwriters laboratories inc these programs help assure delivery of power and performance in the field with a high level of product quality and reliability

our rd model differentiates us from much of our competition due to its vertical integration from advanced research to product development manufacturing and applications we continue to devote substantial resources to our rd efforts which generally focus on continually improving the wattage and energy yield of our solar modules we also focus our rd activities on continuously improving module durability and manufacturing efficiencies including throughput improvement volume ramp and material cost reduction based on publicly available information we are one of the leaders in rd investment among pv solar module manufacturers maintaining a rate of innovation that enables rapid wattage gains and cost reductions 

in the course of our rd activities we explore various technologies in our efforts to sustain competitive differentiation in our modules we primarily conduct our rd activities and qualify process and product improvements for full production at our perrysburg ohio plant and then use a systematic process to propagate them to our other production lines we believe that our systematic approach to technology change management provides continuous improvements and ensures uniform adoption across our production lines in addition our production lines are replicas or near replicas of each other and as a result a process or production improvement on one line can be rapidly and reliably deployed to other production lines 

we regularly produce research cells in our laboratories some of which are tested for performance and certified by independent labs such as the national renewable energy laboratory cell efficiency measures the proportion of light converted to electricity in a single solar cell at standard test conditions our research cells are produced using laboratory equipment and methods and are not intended to be representative of our manufacturing capability our module conversion efficiency has improved on average more than half a percent every year for the last ten years we currently hold two world records for cdte pv cell efficiency achieving an independently certified research cell efficiency of 221 and an aperture area module efficiency of 190 we believe that our record cells demonstrate a potential longterm module efficiency entitlement of over 25 that is achievable using our commercialscale manufacturing equipment 

customers 

during 2020 we sold the majority of our solar modules not included in our systems projects to integrators and operators of systems in the united states and france and such thirdparty module sales represented approximately 64 of our total net sales during 2020 longroad energy nextera energy and softbank each accounted for more than 10 of our modules business net sales 

we continue to focus on key geographic markets particularly in areas with abundant solar resources and sizable electricity demand and additional customer relationships to diversify our customer base we also collaborate with providers of community solar solutions which address the residential and small business sectors to provide a broad range of customers with access to competitively priced solar energy regardless of the suitability of their rooftops community solar utilizes relatively small groundmounted installations that provide clean energy to utilities which then offer consumers the ability to buy into a specific community installation and benefit from the solar power generated by that resource the demand for such offerings continues to build as states across the country are enacting community solar policies and utilities are looking to diversify their energy generation portfolio in order to meet customer demand for affordable clean energy we also collaborate with providers of community choice aggregation programs which allow cities and counties to purchase power on behalf of residents and businesses to provide clean energy options at competitive prices our expertise in module technology and utilityscale generation 

paired with community solar andor community choice aggregation allows residential power consumers to “go solar” including those who live in apartment buildings or whose home rooftops cannot accommodate solar panels 

the wholesale commercial and industrial market also represents a promising opportunity for the widespread adoption of pv solar technology as corporations undertake certain sustainability commitments the demand for corporate renewables continues to accelerate with corporations worldwide committing to the re100 campaign a collaborative global initiative of influential businesses committed to 100 renewable electricity we believe we also have a competitive advantage in the commercial and industrial market due to many customers’ sensitivity to the sustainability experience bankability and financial viability of their suppliers and geographically diverse operating locations with our sustainability advantage strong development expertise financial strength and global footprint we are well positioned to meet these needs 

competition 

the solar energy and renewable energy sectors are highly competitive and continually evolving as participants in these sectors strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete within the larger electric power industry we face intense competition for sales of solar modules which has resulted in and may continue to result in reduced average selling prices and loss of market share with respect to our modules business our primary sources of competition are crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers in addition we expect to compete with future entrants into the pv solar industry and existing market participants that offer new or differentiated technological solutions for example many crystalline silicon cell and wafer manufacturers have transitioned from lower efficiency back surface field “bsf” multicrystalline cells the legacy technology against which we have generally competed to higher efficiency passivated emitter rear contact “perc” monocrystalline cells at competitive cost structures additionally while conventional solar modules including the solar modules we produce are monofacial meaning their ability to produce energy is a function of direct and diffuse irradiance on their front side certain manufacturers of monocrystalline perc modules offer bifacial modules that also capture diffuse irradiance on the back side of a module within the larger electric power industry we compete with companies that currently offer or are developing other renewable energy technologies including wind hydroelectric geothermal biomass and tidal technologies as well as traditional energy generation sources 

certain of our existing or future competitors may have direct or indirect access to sovereign capital which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time among pv solar module manufacturers the principal methods of competition include sales price per watt wattage through a larger form factor or an improved conversion efficiency energy yield reliability warranty terms and customer payment terms our results of operations could be adversely affected if competitors reduce module pricing to levels below their costs bid aggressively low prices for module sale agreements or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time we believe the solar industry may from time to time experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity exceeds global demand and that such periods will also put pressure on pricing which could adversely affect our results of operations for additional information see item 1a “risk factors – competition in solar markets globally and across the solar value chain is intense and could remain that way for an extended period of time an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may continue to cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations” 

raw materials 

our cdte module manufacturing process uses approximately 30 types of raw materials and components to construct a solar module one critical raw material in our production process is cdte other raw materials and components that are critical to our manufacturing process include front glass coated with transparent conductive oxide other semiconductor materials organics such as photo resist tempered back glass frames packaging components such as interlayer cord platecord plate cap lead wire and solar connectors before we use these materials and components 

in our manufacturing process a supplier must undergo rigorous qualification procedures and we continually evaluate new suppliers as part of our cost reduction roadmaps when possible we attempt to use suppliers that can provide a raw material supply source that is near our manufacturing locations reducing the cost and lead times for such materials several of our key raw materials and components are either singlesourced or sourced from a limited number of suppliers 

solar module collection and recycling 

we are committed to extended producer responsibility and take into account the environmental impact of our products over their entire life cycle as part of such efforts we previously established the solar industry’s first global comprehensive module collection and recycling program our module recycling process is designed to maximize the recovery of materials including the glass and encapsulated semiconductor material for use in new modules or other products and enhances the sustainability profile of our modules approximately 90 of each collected first solar module can be recycled into materials for reuse for certain legacy customer sales contracts that were covered under this program which has since been discontinued we agreed to pay the costs for the collection and recycling of qualifying solar modules and the end users agreed to notify us disassemble their solar power systems package the solar modules for shipment and revert ownership rights over the modules back to us at the end of the modules’ service lives we currently have recycling facilities operating at each of our manufacturing facilities in the united states malaysia and vietnam and at our former manufacturing facility location in germany 

the eu’s waste electrical and electronic equipment “weee” directive places the obligation of recycling including collection treatment and environmentally sound disposal of electrical and electronic equipment products upon producers and is applicable to all pv solar modules in eu member states for modules covered under our program that were previously sold into and installed in the eu we continue to maintain a commitment to cover the estimated collection and recycling costs consistent with our historical program additionally as a result of the transposition of the weee directive by the eu member states we have adjusted our recycling offerings as required in various eu member states to ensure compliance with specific eu member state weee regulations 

solar module warranties 

we provide a limited pv solar module warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for up to 12 years we also typically warrant that modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 98 of their labeled power output rating during the first year with the warranty coverage reducing by a degradation factor every year thereafter throughout the limited power output warranty period of up to 30 years among other things our solar module warranty also covers the resulting power output loss from cell cracking for additional information on our solar module warranty programs refer to item 1a “risk factors – problems with product quality or performance may cause us to incur significant andor unexpected contractual damages andor warranty and related expenses damage our market reputation and prevent us from maintaining or increasing our market share” 

systems business 

project development 

project development activities generally include i selecting securing and maintaining the project site ii obtaining the requisite interconnection and transmission studies iii executing an interconnection agreement iv obtaining environmental and landuse permits and v entering into a power purchase agreement “ppa” with an offtaker for the power to be generated by the project the sequence of such development activities varies by international location and in certain locations may begin by initially bidding for ppa or offtake agreements these activities culminate in receiving the right to construct and operate a pv solar power system 

depending on the market opportunity or geographic location we may acquire projects in various stages of development or acquire project companies from developers in order to complete the development process construct a system incorporating our modules and sell the system to a longterm owner we may also collaborate with local partners in connection with these project development activities depending on the type of project or geographic location ppas or feedintariff “fit” structures define the price and terms the utility or customer will pay for power produced from the project depending primarily on the location stage of development upon our acquisition of the project andor other site attributes the development cycle typically ranges from one to two years but may be as long as five years we may be required to incur significant costs for preliminary engineering permitting legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built if there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals we may be forced to incur additional costs or impair our project assets and the termination rights of the offtaker under the ppa may be triggered 

following an evaluation of the longterm cost structure competitiveness and riskadjusted returns of our us project development business we have determined it is in the best interest of our stockholders to pursue the sale of this business on january 24 2021 we entered into an agreement with omers for the sale of our us project development operations which comprises the business of developing contracting for the construction of and selling utilityscale pv solar power systems the transaction includes our approximately 10 gw ac utilityscale solar project pipeline including the advancedstage horizon madison ridgely rabbitbrush and oak trail projects that are expected to commence construction in the next two years the 30 mw ac barilla solar project which is operational and certain other equipment in addition omers has agreed to certain module purchase commitments the completion of the transaction is contingent on a number of closing conditions including the receipt of regulatory approval from ferc the expiration of the mandatory waiting period under us antitrust laws a review of the transaction by cfius and other customary closing conditions assuming satisfaction of such closing conditions we expect the sale to be completed in the first half of 2021 

epc services 

epc services generally include i engineering design and related services ii bos procurement and iii construction contracting and management in 2019 we transitioned from an internal epc service model in the united states to an external model in which we leverage the capabilities of thirdparty epc services in providing power plant solutions to our systems segment customers the shift to an external epc service model in the united states aligns with our typical model in international markets and is facilitated in part by our series 6 module technology and its improved bos compatibility for systems we constructed we typically provided limited warranties for defects in engineering design installation and bos part workmanship for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a system or a block within the system for certain systems we constructed we have also provided an energy performance test during the first or second year of a system’s operation to demonstrate that the actual energy generation for the applicable year meets or exceeds the modeled energy expectation after certain adjustments such as irradiance weather module degradation soiling curtailment and other conditions that may affect a system’s energy output but are unrelated to quality design or construction 

om services 

our typical om service arrangements involve the performance of standard activities associated with operating and maintaining a pv solar power system we perform such activities pursuant to the scope of services outlined in the underlying contract these activities are considered necessary to optimize system performance and comply with ppas other agreements and regulations although the scope of our services varies by contract and jurisdiction our om service arrangements generally include 247 system monitoring compliance with various project agreements andor regulatory agencies energy forecasting performance engineering analysis regular performance reporting turnkey maintenance services including spare parts and corrective maintenance repair warranty management and environmental services as part of our om services we also typically provide an effective availability guarantee which stipulates that a system will be available to generate a certain percentage of total possible energy during a 

specific period after adjusting for factors outside our control as the service provider such as weather curtailment outages force majeure and other conditions that may affect system availability 

following an evaluation of the longterm cost structure competitiveness and riskadjusted returns of our om services business we received an offer to purchase certain portions of the business and determined it is in the best interest of our stockholders to pursue this transaction as a result in august 2020 we entered into an agreement with clairvest for the sale of our north american om operations the completion of the transaction is contingent on a number of closing conditions including the receipt of certain thirdparty consents and other customary closing conditions assuming satisfaction of such closing conditions we expect the sale to be completed in the first half of 2021 

customers 

our systems customers consist of utilities independent power producers commercial and industrial companies and other system owners such as investors who are looking for longterm investment vehicles that are expected to generate consistent returns such customers may purchase completed systems which include our pv solar modules or any combination of development epc andor om services we also seek to provide innovative power plant solutions to facilitate the adoption and optimize the use of our technology during 2020 the substantial majority of our systems business sales were in the united states and japan and the principal customers of our systems business were goldman sachs renewable power smfl mirai partners and mitsui  co who each accounted for more than 10 of our systems business net sales 

competition 

with respect to our systems business we face competition from other providers of renewable energy solutions including developers of pv solar power systems and developers of other forms of renewable energy projects such as wind hydroelectric geothermal biomass and tidal projects we may also compete with other developers that integrate energy storage solutions with pv solar or wind projects thereby enabling system owners to better align the delivery of energy with periods of peak demand to the extent other solar module manufacturers become more vertically integrated we expect to face increased competition from such companies as well certain current or potential future competitors may have a low cost of capital andor access to sovereign capital the decline in module prices over the last several years has increased interest in solar energy worldwide and there are limited barriers to entry in certain parts of the pv solar value chain depending on the geographic market accordingly competition at the system level can be intense thereby exerting downward pressure on systemlevel selling prices industrywide see item 1a “risk factors – competition at the system level can be intense thereby potentially exerting downward pressure on systemlevel profit margins industrywide which could reduce our profitability and adversely affect our results of operations” 

own and operate 

from time to time we may temporarily own and operate or retain interests in certain of our systems for a period of time based on strategic opportunities or market factors the ability to do so provides certain potential benefits including greater control over the sales process and offering a lower risk profile to project buyers as of december 31 2020 we owned and operated a number of systems in various geographic markets including chile india the united states and the asiapacific region for more information about the economics of such ownership and the impacts on our liquidity see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources” 

intellectual property 

our success depends in part on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technology and to conduct our business without infringing on the proprietary rights of others we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks and trade secrets as well as associate and thirdparty confidentiality agreements to safeguard our intellectual property we regularly file patent applications to protect inventions arising from our rd activities and are currently pursuing patent applications in the united states and other countries our patent applications and any future patent applications may not result in a patent being issued with the scope of the claims we seek or at all and any patents we may receive may be challenged invalidated or declared unenforceable in addition we have registered andor have applied to register trademarks and service marks in the united states and a number of foreign countries for “first solar” 

with respect to proprietary knowhow that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce we rely on among other things trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests we believe that many elements of our pv solar module manufacturing processes including our unique materials sourcing involve proprietary knowhow technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications including technical processes equipment designs algorithms and procedures we have taken security measures to protect these elements our rd personnel have entered into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us these agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our associates to assign to us all of the inventions designs and technologies they develop during the course of their employment with us we also require our customers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose sensitive aspects of our modules technology or business plans we have not been subject to any material intellectual property infringement or misappropriation claims 

regulatory environmental health and safety matters 

we are subject to various federal state local and international laws and regulations relating to modules systems and services and are often subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with national and local ordinances relating to building codes safety environmental protection land acquisition utility interconnection and metering and other matters our systems business is also subject to regulatory oversight and liability if we fail to operate our pv solar power systems in compliance with electric reliability rules the impact of these laws and requirements may increase our overall costs and may delay prevent or increase the cost of manufacturing pv modules or the construction and operation of the systems we intend to build as we operate in the us and internationally we are also subject to the application of us trade laws and trade laws of other countries such tariffs and policies or any other us or global trade remedies or other trade barriers that apply to us given our global operations may directly or indirectly affect our business financial condition and results of operations see item 1a “risk factors – existing regulations and policies changes thereto and new regulations and policies may present technical regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of pv solar products or systems which may significantly reduce demand for our modules systems or services” 

we are also subject to the application of various antibribery laws some of which prohibit improper payments to government and nongovernment persons and entities and others eg the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” and the uk bribery act that extend their application to activities outside their country of origin we compete against companies for contracts in china india south america and the middle east which require substantial government contact and where norms can differ from us standards and not all competitors are subject to compliance with the same antibribery laws see item 1a risk factors – “we could be adversely affected by any violations of the fcpa the uk bribery act and other foreign antibribery laws” 

we are also subject to various federal state local and international laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the use management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes occupational health and safety and the cleanup of contaminated sites our operations include the use handling storage transportation generation and disposal of hazardous 

materials and wastes therefore we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions and costs arising from thirdparty property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations or noncompliance with environmental permits required for our operations we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety requirements and do not expect to incur material expenditures for environmental and occupational health and safety controls in the foreseeable future however future developments such as the implementation of new more stringent laws and regulations more aggressive enforcement policies or the discovery of unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see item 1a “risk factors – environmental obligations and liabilities could have a substantial negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations”

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the following information together with the other information in this annual report on form 10k before buying shares of our stock if any of the following risks or uncertainties occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our stock could decline 

summary of risk factors 

the following is a summary of the principal risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations and make an investment in our stock speculative or risky you should read this summary together with the more detailed description of each risk factor contained below 

risks related to our markets and customers 

• competition in solar markets globally and across the solar value chain is intense and could remain that way for an extended period of time an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may continue to cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand if our competitors reduce module pricing to levels near or below their manufacturing costs or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time or if demand for pv modules does not grow sufficiently to justify the current production supply our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

• pv solar and related technologies may not be suitable for continued adoption at economically attractive rates of return sufficient additional demand for solar modules related technologies and systems may not develop or may take longer to develop than we anticipate causing our net sales and profit to flatten or decline and threatening our ability to sustain profitability 

• the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives tax incentives renewable energy targets and other support for ongrid solar electricity applications or other public policies could negatively impact demand andor price levels for our solar modules and systems the imposition of tariffs on our products could materially increase our costs to perform under our contracts with customers which could adversely affect our results of operations 

• an increase in interest rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets including a reduction in total tax equity availability could make it difficult for customers to finance the cost of a pv solar power system and could reduce the demand for our modules or systems andor lead to a reduction in the average selling price for such offerings 

risks related to our operations manufacturing and technology 

• we face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules if global supply exceeds global demand it could lead to a further reduction in the average selling price for pv solar modules which could reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations 

• problems with product quality or performance may cause us to incur significant andor unexpected contractual damages andor warranty and related expenses damage our market reputation and prevent us from maintaining or increasing our market share 

• our failure to further refine our technology reduce module manufacturing and bos costs and develop and introduce improved pv products could render our solar modules or systems uncompetitive and reduce our net sales profitability andor market share 

• several of our key raw materials components particularly cdte and manufacturing equipment are either singlesourced or sourced from a limited number of suppliers and their failure to perform could cause manufacturing delays and impair our ability to deliver solar modules to customers in the required quality and quantities and at a price that is profitable to us 

risks related to our systems business 

• project development or construction activities may not be successful projects under development may not receive required permits real property rights ppas interconnection and transmission arrangements or financing or construction may not commence or proceed as scheduled which could increase our costs and impair our ability to recover our investments 

• we may be unable to acquire or lease land obtain necessary interconnection and transmission rights andor obtain the approvals licenses permits and electric transmission grid interconnection and transmission rights necessary to build and operate pv solar power systems in a timely and cost effective manner and regulatory agencies local communities labor unions tribes or other third parties may delay prevent or increase the cost of construction and operation of the system we intend to build 

• we may not be able to obtain longterm contracts for the sale of power produced by our projects at prices and on other terms favorable to attract financing and other investments adversely affecting our results of operations 

• lack of transmission capacity availability potential upgrade costs to the transmission grid and other system constraints could significantly impact our ability to build pv solar power systems and generate solar electricity power sales 

risks related to regulations 

• existing regulations and policies changes thereto and new regulations and policies may present technical regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of pv solar products or systems which may significantly reduce demand for our modules systems or services 

risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

• the extent to which the covid19 pandemic could impact us is highly uncertain and will depend largely on the severity and duration of the pandemic measures taken to contain the spread of the virus and policies implemented by governmental authorities to ease restrictions in a phased manner 

general risk factors 

• if our longlived assets or project related assets become impaired we may be required to record significant charges to earnings 

• our credit agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business 

risks related to our markets and customers 

competition in solar markets globally and across the solar value chain is intense and could remain that way for an extended period of time an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may continue to cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in the aggregate we believe manufacturers of solar cells and modules have significant installed production capacity relative to global demand and the ability for additional capacity expansion for example we estimate that in 2020 approximately 50 gw dc of capacity was added by solar module manufacturers primarily but not exclusively in asia we believe the solar industry may from time to time experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity exceeds global demand and that such periods will continue to put pressure on pricing during the past several years industry average selling prices per watt have declined in many markets at times significantly both at the module and system levels as competitors have reduced prices to sell inventories worldwide there may be additional pressure on global demand and average selling prices in the future resulting from fluctuating demand in certain major solar markets such as china if our competitors reduce module pricing to levels near or below their manufacturing costs or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time or if demand for pv modules does not grow sufficiently to justify the current production supply our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

if pv solar and related technologies are not suitable for continued adoption at economically attractive rates of return or if sufficient additional demand for solar modules related technologies and systems does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate our net sales and profit may flatten or decline and we may be unable to sustain profitability 

in comparison to traditional forms of energy generation the solar energy market continues to be at a relatively early stage of development if utilityscale pv solar technology proves unsuitable for continued adoption at economically attractive rates of return or if additional demand for solar modules and systems fails to develop sufficiently or takes longer to develop than we anticipate we may be unable to grow our business or generate sufficient net sales to sustain profitability in addition demand for solar modules related technologies and systems in our targeted markets may develop to a lesser extent than we anticipate many factors may affect the viability of continued adoption of utilityscale pv solar technology in our targeted markets as well as the demand for solar modules and systems generally including the following 

• costeffectiveness of the electricity generated by pv solar power systems compared to conventional energy sources such as natural gas which fuel source may be subject to significant price fluctuations from time to time and other renewable energy sources such as wind geothermal and hydroelectric 

• changes in tax trade remedies and other public policy as well as changes in economic market and other conditions that affect the price of and demand for conventional energy resources nonsolar renewable energy resources eg wind and hydroelectric and energy efficiency programs and products including increases or decreases in the prices of natural gas coal oil and other fossil fuels and in the prices of competing renewable resources 

• the extent of competition barriers to entry and overall conditions and timing related to the development of solar in new and emerging market segments such as commercial and industrial customers community solar community choice aggregators and other customer segments 

• availability substance and magnitude of support programs including federal state and local government subsidies incentives targets and renewable portfolio standards among other policies and programs to accelerate the development of the solar industry 

• performance reliability and availability of energy generated by pv solar power systems compared to conventional and other nonsolar renewable energy sources and products particularly conventional energy generation capable of providing 24hour nonintermittent baseload power 

• the development functionality scale cost and timing of energy storage solutions and 

• changes in the amount and priorities of capital expenditures by end users of solar modules and systems eg utilities which capital expenditures tend to decrease when the economy slows or when interest rates increase thereby resulting in redirection away from solar generation to development of competing forms of electric generation and to distribution eg smart grid transmission and energy efficiency measures 

the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives tax incentives renewable energy targets and other support for ongrid solar electricity applications or other public policies such as tariffs or other trade remedies imposed on solar cells and modules could negatively impact demand andor price levels for our solar modules and systems and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales or increase our costs thereby adversely impacting our operating results 

although we believe that solar energy will experience widespread adoption in those applications where it competes economically with traditional forms of energy without any support programs in certain markets our net sales and profits remain subject to variability based on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives federal state and local governmental bodies in many countries have provided subsidies in the form of fits rebates tax incentives and other incentives to end users distributors system integrators and manufacturers of pv solar products many of these support programs expire phase out over time require renewal by the applicable authority or may be amended a summary of certain recent developments in the major government support programs that may impact our business appears under item 1 “business – support programs” to the extent these support programs are reduced earlier than previously expected or are changed retroactively such changes could negatively impact demand andor price levels for our solar modules and systems lead to a reduction in our net sales and adversely impact our operating results another consideration in the us market and to a lesser extent in other global markets is the effect of governmental landuse planning policies and environmental policies on utilityscale pv solar development the adoption of restrictive landuse designations or environmental regulations that proscribe or restrict the siting of utilityscale solar facilities could adversely affect the marginal cost of such development 

changes or threatened changes in us regulatory policy may subject us to significant risks including the following 

• a reduction or removal of clean energy programs and initiatives and the incentives they provide may diminish the market for future solar energy offtake agreements slow the retirement of aging fossil fuel plants including the retirements of coal generation plants and reduce the ability for solar project developers to compete for offtake agreements which may reduce pv solar module sales 

• any limitations on the value or availability to potential investors of tax incentives that benefit solar energy projects such as the itc and accelerated depreciation deductions could result in reducing such investors’ economic returns causing a reduction in the availability of affordable financing thereby reducing demand for pv solar modules and 

• any effort to overturn federal and state laws regulations or policies that are supportive of solar energy generation or that remove costs or other limitations on other types of electricity generation that compete with solar energy projects could negatively impact our ability to compete with traditional forms of electricity generation and materially and adversely affect our business 

application of us trade laws or trade laws of other countries may also impact either directly or indirectly our operating results in some instances the application of trade laws is currently beneficial to the company and changes in their application could have an adverse impact 

for example the united states currently imposes different types of tariffs andor other trade remedies on certain imported crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules and cells from various countries these tariffs include a global safeguard measure imposed pursuant to section 201 of the trade act of 1974 that provides for tariffs on imported crystalline silicon solar modules and a tariffrate quota on imported crystalline silicon solar cells between february 2021 and february 2022 the tariff rate is 18 for imported crystalline silicon photovoltaic modules and imported crystalline silicon solar cells above the tariff rate quota thin film solar cell products such as our cdte technology are specifically excluded from the tariffs the positive impact of this measure on our operating results was reduced by a tariff exclusion for imports of bifacial modules that the us trade representative granted in june 2019 and that the us president withdrew in october 2020 further changes to the measure including as a result of pending litigation challenging the withdrawal of the exclusion could further impact our operating results in addition the united states currently imposes antidumping and countervailing duties on certain imported crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells and modules from china and taiwan such antidumping and countervailing duties can change over time pursuant to annual reviews conducted by the us department of commerce and a decline in duty rates could have an adverse impact on our operating results 

in other instances the application of us trade laws has had or could have an adverse impact on our operating results by increasing our costs or limiting the competitiveness of our products examples include tariffs the united states imposes on certain imported aluminum and steel articles generally at rates of 10 and 25 respectively under section 232 of the trade expansion act of 1962 and potential tariffs on imports of goods from vietnam under section 301 of the tariff act of 1974 if such tariffs are imposed on solar modules imported from vietnam it could negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

internationally in july 2018 the indian government imposed a safeguard measure on solar cells and modules imported from various countries including member countries of the organisation for economic cooperation and development “oecd” china and malaysia for a twoyear period starting at 25 through july 2019 and declining by five percentage points in each subsequent sixmonth period in july 2020 the indian government announced an extension to the safeguard duty regime at a revised rate of 149 through december 2020 and declining to 145 through july 2021 these duties are applicable to imports from member countries of the oecd china vietnam and thailand but imports from malaysia have been exempted from the revised safeguard measures 

such tariffs and policies or any other us or global trade remedies or other trade barriers may directly or indirectly affect us or global markets for solar energy and our business financial condition and results of operations these examples show that established markets for pv solar development face uncertainties arising from policy regulatory and governmental constraints while the expected potential of the markets we are targeting is significant policy promulgation and market development are especially vulnerable to governmental inertia political instability the imposition or lowering of trade remedies and other trade barriers geopolitical risk fossil fuel subsidization potentially stringent localization requirements and limited available infrastructure 

an increase in interest rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets including a reduction in total tax equity availability could make it difficult for customers to finance the cost of a pv solar power system and could reduce the demand for our modules or systems andor lead to a reduction in the average selling price for such offerings 

many of our customers and our systems business depend on debt andor equity financing to fund the initial capital expenditure required to develop build andor purchase a pv solar power system as a result an increase in interest rates or a reduction in the supply of project debt financing or tax equity investments could reduce the number of solar projects that receive financing or otherwise make it difficult for our customers or our systems business to secure the financing necessary to develop build purchase or install a pv solar power system on favorable terms or at all and thus lower demand for our solar modules which could limit our growth or reduce our net sales see the risk factor entitled “the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives tax incentives renewable energy targets and other support for ongrid solar electricity applications or other public 

policies such as tariffs or other trade remedies imposed on solar cells and modules could negatively impact demand andor price levels for our solar modules and systems and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales or increase our costs thereby adversely impacting our operating results” for additional information in addition we believe that a significant percentage of our customers install systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt an increase in interest rates could lower an investor’s return on investment in a system increase equity return requirements or make alternative investments more attractive relative to pv solar power systems and in each case could cause these customers to seek alternative investments 

we may be unable to fully execute on our longterm strategic plans which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we face numerous difficulties in executing on our longterm strategic plans particularly in new foreign jurisdictions including the following 

• difficulty in competing against companies who may have greater financial resources andor a more effective or established localized business presence andor an ability to operate with minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time 

• difficulty in competing successfully with other technologies such as bifacial modules and ntype monocrystalline wafers and cells 

• difficulty in accurately prioritizing geographic markets that we can most effectively and profitably serve with our pv solar offerings including miscalculations in overestimating or underestimating addressable market demand 

• adverse public policies in countries we operate in andor are pursuing including local content requirements the imposition of trade remedies or capital investment requirements 

• business climates such as that in china that may have the effect of putting foreign companies at a disadvantage relative to domestic companies 

• unstable economic social andor operating environments in foreign jurisdictions including social unrest currency inflation and interest rate uncertainties 

• the possibility of applying an ineffective commercial approach to targeted markets including product offerings that may not meet market needs 

• difficulty in generating sufficient sales volumes at economically sustainable profitability levels 

• difficulty in timely identifying attracting training and retaining qualified sales technical and other personnel in geographies targeted for expansion 

• difficulty in maintaining proper controls and procedures as we expand our business operations in terms of geographical reach including transitioning certain business functions to lowcost geographies with any material control failure potentially leading to reputational damage and loss of confidence in our financial reporting 

• difficulty in competing successfully for market share in overall solar markets as a result of the success of companies participating in the global rooftop pv solar market which is a segment in which we do not have significant historical experience 

• difficulty in establishing and implementing a commercial and operational approach adequate to address the specific needs of the markets we are pursuing 

• difficulty in identifying effective local partners and developing any necessary partnerships with local businesses on commercially acceptable terms 

• difficulty in balancing market demand and manufacturing production in an efficient and timely manner potentially causing our manufacturing capacity to be constrained in some future periods or oversupplied in others and 

• difficulty in obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals to consummate the sale of our us project development business 

refer also to the risk factors entitled “our substantial international operations subject us to a number of risks including unfavorable political regulatory labor and tax conditions in the united states andor foreign countries” and “the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives tax incentives renewable energy targets and other support for ongrid solar electricity applications or other public policies such as tariffs or other trade remedies imposed on solar cells and modules could negatively impact demand andor price levels for our solar modules and systems and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales or increase our costs thereby adversely impacting our operating results” 

the loss of any of our large customers or the inability of our customers and counterparties to perform under their contracts with us could significantly reduce our net sales and negatively impact our results of operations 

our customers include integrators and operators of systems utilities independent power producers commercial and industrial companies and other system owners who may experience intense competition at the system level thereby constraining the ability for such customers to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability the loss of any of our large customers their inability to perform under their contracts or their default in payment could significantly reduce our net sales andor adversely impact our operating results while our contracts with customers typically have certain firm purchase commitments and may include provisions for the payment of amounts to us in certain events of contract termination these contracts may be subject to amendments made by us or requested by our customers these amendments may reduce the volume of modules to be sold under the contract adjust delivery schedules or otherwise decrease the expected revenue under these contracts although we believe that we can mitigate this risk in part by reallocating modules to other customers if the need arises we may be unable in whole or in part to do so on similar terms or at all we may also mitigate this risk by requiring some form of payment security from our customers such as parent guarantees bank guarantees surety bonds or commercial letters of credit however in the event the providers of such payment security fail to perform their obligations our operating results could be adversely impacted 

we may be unable to profitably provide new solar offerings or achieve sufficient market penetration with such offerings 

we may expand our portfolio of offerings to include solutions that build upon our core competencies but for which we have not had significant historical experience including variations in our traditional product offerings or other offerings related to commercial and industrial customers and community solar we cannot be certain that we will be able to ascertain and allocate the appropriate financial and human resources necessary to grow these business areas we could invest capital into growing these businesses but fail to address market or customer needs or otherwise not experience a satisfactory level of financial return also in expanding into these areas we may be competing against companies that previously have not been significant competitors such as companies that currently have substantially more experience than we do in the residential commercial and industrial or other targeted offerings if we are 

unable to achieve growth in these areas our overall growth and financial performance may be limited relative to our competitors and our operating results could be adversely impacted 

risks related to our operations manufacturing and technology 

we face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules if global supply exceeds global demand it could lead to a further reduction in the average selling price for pv solar modules  which could reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations 

the solar and renewable energy industries are highly competitive and are continually evolving as participants strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete with the larger electric power industry within the global pv solar industry we face intense competition from crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers existing or future solar module manufacturers might be acquired by larger companies with significant capital resources thereby further intensifying competition with us in addition the introduction of a low cost disruptive technology could adversely affect our ability to compete which could reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations 

even if demand for solar modules continues to grow the rapid manufacturing capacity expansion undertaken by many module manufacturers in china and certain parts of southeast asia particularly manufacturers of crystalline silicon cells modules and wafers has created and may continue to cause periods of structural imbalance in which supply exceeds demand see the risk factor entitled “competition in solar markets globally and across the solar value chain is intense and could remain that way for an extended period of time an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may continue to cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations” for additional information in addition we believe any significant decrease in the cost of silicon feedstock or polysilicon would reduce the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon modules and lead to further pricing pressure for solar modules and potentially an oversupply of solar modules we also believe many crystalline silicon cell and wafer manufacturers have substantially transitioned from lower efficiency bsf multicrystalline cells the legacy technology against which we have generally competed in our markets to higher efficiency perc monocrystalline cells at competitive cost structures as a result we expect that in the near future our primary competition will be monocrystalline perc based modules with higher conversion efficiencies additionally while conventional solar modules including the solar modules we produce are monofacial meaning their ability to produce energy is a function of direct and diffuse irradiance on their front side certain manufacturers of monocrystalline perc solar modules offer bifacial modules that also capture diffuse irradiance on the back side of a module such technology can improve the overall energy production of a module relative to nameplate frontside efficiency when applied in certain applications and bos configurations which could potentially lower the overall levelized cost of electricity “lcoe” meaning the net present value of a system’s total life cycle costs divided by the quantity of energy that is expected to be produced over the system’s life of a system when compared to systems using conventional solar modules including the modules we produce additionally we believe that our competitors are evaluating the possibility of transitioning from ptype to ntype monocrystalline wafers and cells if successful such transition would further increase the efficiency and energy yield of their product finally many of our competitors are promoting modules with larger overall area based on the use of larger silicon wafers while the transition to such larger wafers would increase nameplate wattage we believe the associated production cost would not improve significantly 

during any such period our competitors could decide to reduce their sales prices in response to competition even below their manufacturing costs in order to generate sales and may do so for a sustained period other competitors may have direct or indirect access to sovereign capital which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time as a result we may be unable to sell our solar modules or systems at attractive prices or for a profit during any period of excess supply of solar modules which would reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations additionally we may decide to lower our average selling 

prices to certain customers in certain markets in response to competition which could also reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations 

problems with product quality or performance may cause us to incur significant andor unexpected contractual damages andor warranty and related expenses damage our market reputation and prevent us from maintaining or increasing our market share 

we perform a variety of module quality and life tests under different environmental conditions upon which we base our assessments of future module performance over the duration of the warranty however if our thin film solar modules perform below expectations we could experience significant warranty and related expenses damage to our market reputation and erosion of our market share with respect to our modules we provide a limited warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for up to 12 years we also typically warrant that modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 98 of their labeled power output rating during the first year with the warranty coverage reducing by a degradation factor every year thereafter throughout the limited power output warranty period of up to 30 years among other things our solar module warranty also covers the resulting power output loss from cell cracking as an alternative form of our standard limited module power output warranty we have also offered an aggregated or systemlevel limited module performance warranty this systemlevel limited module performance warranty is designed for utilityscale systems and provides 25year systemlevel energy degradation protection this warranty represents a practical expedient to address the challenge of identifying from the potential millions of modules installed in a utilityscale system individual modules that may be performing below warranty thresholds by focusing on the aggregate energy generated by the system rather than the power output of individual modules the systemlevel limited module performance warranty is typically calculated as a percentage of a system’s expected energy production adjusted for certain actual site conditions with the warranted level of performance declining each year in a linear fashion but never falling below 80 during the term of the warranty as a result of these warranty programs we bear the risk of product warranty claims long after we have sold our solar modules and recognized net sales 

if any of the assumptions used in estimating our module warranties prove incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses which could adversely impact our financial position operating results and cash flows although we have taken significant precautions to avoid a manufacturing excursion from occurring any manufacturing excursions including any commitments made by us to take remediation actions in respect of affected modules beyond the stated remedies in our warranties could adversely impact our reputation financial position operating results and cash flows 

although our module performance warranties extend for up to 30 years our oldest solar modules manufactured during the qualification of our pilot production line have only been in use since 2001 accordingly our warranties are based on a variety of quality and life tests that enable predictions of durability and future performance these predictions however could prove to be materially different from the actual performance during the warranty period causing us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective solar modules or provide financial remuneration in the future for example our solar modules could suffer various failure modes including breakage delamination corrosion or performance degradation in excess of expectations and our manufacturing operations or supply chain could be subject to materials or process variations that could cause affected modules to fail or underperform compared to our expectations these risks could be amplified as we implement design and process changes in connection with our efforts to improve our products and accelerate module wattage as part of our longterm strategic plans in addition if we increase the number of installations in extreme climates we may experience increased failure rates due to deployment into such field conditions any widespread product failures may damage our market reputation cause our net sales to decline require us to repair or replace the defective modules or provide financial remuneration and result in us taking voluntary remedial measures beyond those required by our standard warranty terms to enhance customer satisfaction which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

in resolving claims under both the limited defect and power output warranties we typically have the option of either repairing or replacing the covered modules or under the limited power output warranty providing additional 

modules to remedy the power shortfall or making certain cash payments however historical versions of our module warranty did not provide a refund remedy consequently we may be obligated to repair or replace the covered modules under such historical programs as our manufacturing process may change from timetotime in accordance with our technology roadmap we may elect to stop production of older versions of our modules that would constitute compatible replacement modules in some jurisdictions our inability to provide compatible replacement modules could potentially expose us to liabilities beyond the limitations of our module warranties which could adversely impact our reputation financial position operating results and cash flows 

for pv solar power systems constructed for customers we typically provide limited warranties for defects in engineering design installation and bos part workmanship for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a system or a block within the system in resolving claims under such bos warranties we have the option of remedying the defect through repair or replacement as with our modules these warranties are based on a variety of quality and life tests that enable predictions of durability and future performance any failures in bos equipment or system construction beyond our expectations may also adversely impact our reputation financial position operating results and cash flows 

in addition our contracts with customers may include provisions with particular product specifications minimum wattage requirements and specified delivery schedules these contracts may be terminated or we may incur significant liquidated damages or other damages if we fail to perform our contractual obligations in addition our costs to perform under these contracts may exceed our estimates which could adversely impact our profitability any failures to comply with our contracts for the sale of our modules could adversely impact our reputation financial position operating results and cash flows 

our failure to further refine our technology reduce module manufacturing and bos costs and develop and introduce improved pv products could render our solar modules or systems uncompetitive and reduce our net sales profitability andor market share 

we need to continue to invest significant financial resources in rd to continue to improve our module conversion efficiencies lower the lcoe of our pv solar power systems and otherwise keep pace with technological advances in the solar industry however rd activities are inherently uncertain and we could encounter practical difficulties in commercializing our research results we seek to continuously improve our products and processes including for example certain planned improvements to our series 6 module technology and manufacturing capabilities such as the implementation of our copper replacement or “cure” program or the increase to our module form factor which we refer to as “series 6 plus” and the resulting changes carry potential risks in the form of delays performance additional costs or other unintended contingencies in addition our significant expenditures for rd may not produce corresponding benefits other companies are developing a variety of competing pv technologies including advanced multicrystalline silicon cells perc or advanced ptype crystalline silicon cells highefficiency ntype crystalline silicon cells bifacial solar modules copper indium gallium diselenide thin films amorphous silicon thin films and new emerging technologies such as hybrid perovskites which could produce solar modules or systems that prove more costeffective or have better performance than our solar modules or systems 

in addition other companies could potentially develop a highly reliable renewable energy system that mitigates the intermittent power generation drawback of many renewable energy systems or offer other valueadded improvements from the perspective of utilities and other system owners in which case such companies could compete with us even if the lcoe associated with such new systems is higher than that of our systems as a result our solar modules or systems may be negatively differentiated or rendered obsolete by the technological advances of our competitors which would reduce our net sales profitability andor market share in addition we often forward price our products and services in anticipation of future cost reductions and technology improvements and thus an inability to further refine our technology and execute our module technology and cost reduction roadmaps could adversely affect our operating results 

some of our manufacturing equipment is customized and sole sourced if our manufacturing equipment fails or if our equipment suppliers fail to perform under their contracts we could experience production disruptions and be unable to satisfy our contractual requirements 

some of our manufacturing equipment including manufacturing equipment related to the production of our series 6 modules is customized to our production lines based on designs or specifications that we provide to equipment manufacturers which then undertake a specialized process to manufacture the custom equipment as a result the equipment is not readily available from multiple vendors and would be difficult to repair or replace if it were to become delayed damaged or stop working if any piece of equipment fails production along the entire production line could be interrupted in addition the failure of our equipment manufacturers to supply equipment in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms could delay our expansion or conversion plans otherwise disrupt our production schedule andor increase our manufacturing costs all of which would adversely impact our operating results 

several of our key raw materials and components are either singlesourced or sourced from a limited number of suppliers and their failure to perform could cause manufacturing delays and impair our ability to deliver solar modules to customers in the required quality and quantities and at a price that is profitable to us 

our failure to obtain raw materials and components that meet our quality quantity and cost requirements in a timely manner could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture our solar modules or increase our manufacturing costs several of our key raw materials and components are either singlesourced or sourced from a limited number of suppliers as a result the failure of any of our suppliers to perform could disrupt our supply chain and adversely impact our operations in addition some of our suppliers are smaller companies that may be unable to supply our increasing demand for raw materials and components as we expand our business we may be unable to identify new suppliers or qualify their products for use on our production lines in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms a constraint on our production may result in our inability to meet our capacity plans andor our obligations under our customer contracts which would have an adverse impact on our business additionally reductions in our production volume may put pressure on suppliers resulting in increased material and component costs 

a disruption in our supply chain for cdte could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture solar modules and could adversely impact our profitability and longterm growth prospects 

a key raw material used in our module production process is a cdte compound tellurium one of the main components of cdte is mainly produced as a byproduct of copper refining and therefore its supply is largely dependent upon demand for copper our supply of cdte could be limited if any of our current suppliers or any of our future suppliers fail to perform or are unable to acquire an adequate supply of tellurium in a timely manner or at commercially reasonable prices if our current suppliers or any of our future suppliers cannot obtain sufficient tellurium they could substantially increase prices or be unable to perform under their contracts furthermore if our competitors begin to use or increase their demand for tellurium our requirements for tellurium increase new applications for tellurium become available or adverse trade laws or policies restrict our ability to obtain tellurium from foreign vendors or make doing so cost prohibitive the supply of tellurium and related cdte compounds could be reduced and prices could increase as we may be unable to pass such increases in the costs of our raw materials through to our customers a substantial increase in tellurium prices or any limitations in the supply of tellurium could adversely impact our profitability and longterm growth objectives 

our future success depends on our ability to effectively balance manufacturing production with market demand convert existing production facilities to support new product lines decrease our cost per watt and when necessary continue to build new manufacturing plants over time in response to market demand all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties 

our future success depends on our ability to effectively balance manufacturing production with market demand convert existing production facilities to support new product lines decrease our cost per watt and increase our manufacturing capacity in a costeffective and efficient manner if we cannot do so we may be unable to decrease our cost per watt maintain our competitive position sustain profitability expand our business or create longterm shareholder value our ability to decrease our cost per watt expand production capacity or convert existing production facilities to support new product lines is subject to significant risks and uncertainties including the following 

• failure to reduce manufacturing material labor or overhead costs 

• an inability to increase production throughput or the average power output per module 

• failure to effectively manage logistics costs associated with the shipping handling storage and distribution of our modules 

• delays and cost overruns as a result of a number of factors many of which may be beyond our control such as our inability to secure successful contracts with equipment vendors 

• our custombuilt equipment taking longer and costing more to manufacture than expected and not operating as designed 

• delays or denial of required approvals by relevant government authorities 

• an inability to hire qualified staff 

• failure to execute our expansion or conversion plans effectively 

• difficulty in balancing market demand and manufacturing production in an efficient and timely manner potentially causing our manufacturing capacity to be constrained in some future periods or oversupplied in others and 

• incurring manufacturing asset writedowns writeoffs and other charges and costs which may be significant during those periods in which we idle slow down shut down convert or otherwise adjust our manufacturing capacity 

if our estimates regarding the future costs of collecting and recycling cdte solar modules covered by our solar module collection and recycling program are incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses and face a significant unplanned cash burden 

as necessary we fund any incremental amounts for our estimated collection and recycling obligations on an annual basis based on the estimated costs of collecting and recycling covered modules estimated rates of return on our restricted marketable securities and an estimated solar module life of 25 years less amounts already funded in prior years we estimate the cost of our collection and recycling obligations based on the present value of the expected future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules which includes estimates for the cost of packaging materials the cost of freight from the solar module installation sites to a recycling center material labor and capital costs and byproduct credits for certain materials recovered during the recycling process we base these estimates on our experience collecting and recycling solar modules and certain assumptions regarding costs at the time the 

solar modules will be collected and recycled if our estimates prove incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses and could also face a significant unplanned cash burden at the time we realize our estimates are incorrect or end users return their modules which could adversely affect our operating results in addition participating end users can return their modules covered under the collection and recycling program at any time as a result we could be required to collect and recycle covered cdte solar modules earlier than we expect 

our failure to protect our intellectual property rights may undermine our competitive position and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against thirdparty allegations of infringement may be costly 

protection of our proprietary processes methods and other technology is critical to our business failure to protect and monitor the use of our existing intellectual property rights could result in the loss of valuable technologies we rely primarily on patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property we regularly file patent applications to protect certain inventions arising from our rd and are currently pursuing such patent applications in various countries in accordance with our strategy for intellectual property in that jurisdiction our existing patents and future patents could be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents or if patents are issued to us such patents may not be sufficient to provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies 

we also rely on unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position although we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our associates and third parties to protect our intellectual property such confidentiality agreements are limited in duration and could be breached and may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary manufacturing expertise adequate remedies may not be available in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise in addition others may obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or legal means the failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes equipment technology trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise methods and compounds could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries especially any developing countries into which we may expand our operations in some countries we have not applied for patent trademark or copyright protection 

third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary technologies or other intellectual property rights which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology can be difficult and expensive additionally litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others we cannot ensure that the outcome of such potential litigation will be in our favor and such litigation may be costly and may divert management attention and other resources away from our business an adverse determination in any such litigation may impair our intellectual property rights and may harm our business prospects and reputation in addition we have no insurance coverage against such litigation costs and would have to bear all costs arising from such litigation to the extent we are unable to recover them from other parties 

if any future production lines are not built in line with committed schedules it may adversely affect our future growth plans if any future production lines do not achieve operating metrics similar to our existing production lines our solar modules could perform below expectations and cause us to lose customers 

if we are unable to systematically replicate our production lines over time and achieve operating metrics similar to our existing production lines our manufacturing capacity could be substantially constrained our manufacturing costs per watt could increase and our growth could be limited such factors may result in lower net sales and lower net income than we anticipate for instance future production lines could produce solar modules that have lower conversion efficiencies higher failure rates andor higher rates of degradation than solar modules from our existing 

production lines and we could be unable to determine the cause of the lower operating metrics or develop and implement solutions to improve performance 

our substantial international operations subject us to a number of risks including unfavorable political regulatory labor and tax conditions in the united states andor foreign countries 

we have significant manufacturing development sales and marketing operations both within and outside the united states and expect to continue to expand our operations worldwide as a result we are subject to the legal political social tax and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions 

risks inherent to international operations include but are not limited to the following 

• difficulty in enforcing agreements in foreign legal systems

our business in foreign markets requires us to respond to rapid changes in market conditions in these countries our overall success as a global business depends in part on our ability to succeed in differing legal regulatory economic social and political conditions we may not be able to timely develop and implement policies and strategies that will be effective in each location where we do business 

risks related to our systems business 

project development or construction activities may not be successful projects under development may not receive required permits real property rights ppas interconnection and transmission arrangements or financing or construction may not commence or proceed as scheduled which could increase our costs and impair our ability to recover our investments 

the development and construction of solar energy generation facilities and other energy infrastructure projects involve numerous risks we may be required to spend significant sums for land and interconnection rights preliminary engineering permitting legal services and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built success in developing a particular project is contingent upon among other things 

• obtaining financeable land rights including land rights for the project site transmission lines and environmental mitigation 

• entering into financeable arrangements for the purchase of the electrical output capacity ancillary services and renewable energy attributes generated by the project 

• receipt from governmental agencies of required environmental landuse and construction and operation permits and approvals

• payment of ppa interconnection and other deposits some of which are nonrefundable 

• providing required payment and performance security for the development of the project such as through the provision of letters of credit and 

• timely implementation and satisfactory completion of construction 

successful completion of a particular project may be adversely affected delayed andor rendered infeasible by numerous factors including 

• delays in obtaining and maintaining required governmental permits and approvals including appeals of approvals obtained 

• potential permit and litigation challenges from project stakeholders including local residents environmental organizations labor organizations tribes and others who may oppose the project 

• in connection with any such permit and litigation challenges grants of injunctive relief to stop development andor construction of a project

• cost or schedule impacts arising from changes in federal state or local landuse or regulatory policies 

• changes in electric utility procurement practices 

• risks arising from potential transmission grid congestion limited transmission capacity and grid reliability constraints 

• project delays that could adversely impact our ability to maintain interconnection rights 

• additional complexities when conducting project development or construction activities in foreign jurisdictions either on a standalone basis or in collaboration with local business partners including operating in accordance with the fcpa and applicable local laws and customs 

• unfavorable tax treatment or adverse changes to tax policy

• adverse environmental and geological conditions 

• force majeure and other events out of our control 

• climate change and 

• change in law risks 

if we fail to complete the development of a solar energy project fail to meet one or more agreed upon target construction milestone dates fail to achieve systemlevel capacity or fail to meet other contract terms we may be subject to forfeiture of significant deposits under ppas or interconnection agreements or termination of such agreements incur significant liquidated damages penalties andor other obligations under other project related agreements and may not be able to recover our investment in the project if we are unable to complete the development of a solar energy project we may impair some or all of these capitalized investments which would have an adverse impact on our net income in the period in which the loss is recognized 

we may be unable to acquire or lease land obtain necessary interconnection and transmission rights andor obtain the approvals licenses permits and electric transmission grid interconnection and transmission rights necessary to build and operate pv solar power systems in a timely and cost effective manner and regulatory agencies local communities labor unions tribes or other third parties may delay prevent or increase the cost of construction and operation of the system we intend to build 

in order to construct and operate our pv solar power systems we need to acquire or lease land and rights of way obtain interconnection rights negotiate agreements with affected transmission systems and obtain all necessary federal state county local and foreign approvals licenses and permits as well as rights to interconnect the systems to the transmission grid and transmit energy generated from the system we may be unable to acquire the land or lease interests needed may not obtain or maintain satisfactory interconnection rights may have difficulty reaching agreements with affected transmission systems andor incur unexpected network upgrade costs may not receive or retain the requisite approvals permits licenses and interconnection and transmission rights or may encounter other problems that could delay or prevent us from successfully constructing and operating such systems 

many of our proposed projects are located on or require access through public lands administered by federal and state agencies pursuant to competitive public leasing and rightofway procedures and processes our projects may also be located on tribal land pursuant to land agreements that must be approved by tribal governments and federal agencies the authorization for the use construction and operation of systems and associated transmission facilities on federal state tribal and private lands will also require the assessment and evaluation of mineral rights private rightsofway and other easements environmental agricultural cultural recreational and aesthetic impacts and the likely mitigation of adverse impacts to these and other resources and uses the inability to obtain the required permits and other federal state local and tribal approvals and any excessive delays in obtaining such permits and approvals due for example to litigation or thirdparty appeals could potentially prevent us from successfully constructing and operating such systems in a timely manner and could result in the potential forfeiture of any deposit we have made with respect to a given project moreover project approvals subject to project modifications and conditions including mitigation requirements and costs could affect the financial success of a given project changing regulatory requirements and the discovery of unknown site conditions could also affect the financial success of a given project 

in addition local labor unions may increase the cost of project development in california and elsewhere we may also be subject to labor unavailability andor increased union labor requirements due to multiple simultaneous projects in a geographic region 

we may not be able to obtain longterm contracts for the sale of power produced by our projects at prices and on other terms favorable to attract financing and other investments  with regard to projects for which electricity is or will be sold on an open contract basis rather than under a ppa our results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent prevailing spot electricity prices decline in an unexpected manner 

obtaining longterm contracts for the sale of power produced by our projects at prices and on other terms favorable to us is essential for obtaining financing and commencing construction of our projects we must compete for ppas against other developers of solar and renewable energy projects this intense competition for ppas has resulted in downward pressure on ppa pricing for newly contracted projects in addition we believe the solar industry may experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand that put downward pressure on module pricing this downward pressure on module pricing also creates downward pressure on ppa pricing for newly contracted projects see the risk factor entitled “competition at the system level can be intense thereby potentially exerting downward pressure on systemlevel profit margins industrywide which could reduce our profitability and adversely affect our results of operations” for additional information if falling ppa pricing results in forecasted project revenue that is insufficient to generate returns anticipated to be demanded in the project sale market our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

other sources of power such as natural gasfired power plants have historically been cheaper than the cost of solar power and certain types of generation projects such as natural gasfired power plants can deliver power on a firm basis the inability to compete successfully against other power producers or otherwise enter into ppas favorable to us would negatively affect our ability to develop and finance our projects and negatively impact our revenue in addition the availability of ppas is dependent on utility and corporate energy procurement practices that could evolve and shift allocation of market risks over time in addition ppa availability and terms are a function of a number of economic regulatory tax and public policy factors which are also subject to change furthermore certain of our projects may be scheduled for substantial completion prior to the commencement of a longterm ppa with a major offtaker in which case we would be required to enter into a stubperiod ppa for the intervening time period or sell down the project we may not be able to do either on terms that are commercially attractive to us finally the electricity from certain of our projects is or is expected to be sold on an open contract basis for a period of time rather than under a ppa if prevailing spot electricity prices relating to any such project were to decline in an unexpected manner such project may decline in value and our results of operations could otherwise be adversely affected 

even if we are able to obtain ppas favorable to us the ability of our offtake counterparties to fulfill their contractual obligations to us depends in part on their creditworthiness these counterparties such as our investorowned utility counterparties in the state of california which may have liability for damages associated with california’s recent wildfires could suffer a deterioration of their creditworthiness or become and in one case has become subject to bankruptcy insolvency or liquidation proceedings or otherwise for example in january 2019 pge corporation and pacific gas and electric company filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of title 11 of the united states code in the us bankruptcy court for the northern district of california if one or more of our counterparties becomes subject to bankruptcy insolvency or liquidation proceedings or if the creditworthiness of any counterparty deteriorates we could experience an underpayment or nonpayment under ppa agreements and our ability to attract debt or equity financing for our projects could be impaired 

lack of transmission capacity availability potential upgrade costs to the transmission grid and other system constraints could significantly impact our ability to build pv solar power systems and generate solar electricity power sales 

in order to deliver electricity from our pv solar power systems to our customers our projects generally need to connect to the transmission grid the lack of available capacity on the transmission grid could substantially impact our projects and cause reductions in project size delays in project implementation increases in costs from transmission upgrades and potential forfeitures of any deposit we have made with respect to a given project in addition there could be unexpected costs required to complete transmission and network upgrades that adversely 

impact the economic viability of our pv solar power systems these transmission and network issues and costs as well as issues relating to the availability of large equipment such as transformers and switchgear could significantly impact our ability to interconnect our systems to the transmission grid build such systems and generate solar electricity sales 

competition at the system level can be intense thereby potentially exerting downward pressure on systemlevel profit margins industrywide which could reduce our profitability and adversely affect our results of operations 

the significant decline in pv solar module prices over the last several years continues to create a challenging environment for module manufacturers but it has also helped drive demand for solar electricity worldwide aided by such lower module prices our customers and potential customers have in many cases been willing and able to bid aggressively for new projects and ppas using low cost assumptions for modules bos parts installation maintenance and other costs as the basis for such bids relatively low barriers to entry for solar project developers including those we compete with have led to depending on the market and other factors intense competition at the system level which may result in an environment in which systemlevel pricing falls rapidly thereby further increasing demand for solar energy solutions but constraining the ability for project developers and diversified companies such as first solar to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability accordingly while we believe our system offerings and experience are positively differentiated in many cases from that of our competitors we may fail to correctly identify our competitive position we may be unable to develop or maintain a sufficient magnitude of new system projects at economically attractive rates of return and we may not otherwise be able to achieve meaningful profitability under our longterm strategic plans 

depending on the market opportunity we may be at a disadvantage compared to potential systemlevel competitors for example certain of our competitors may have a stronger andor more established localized business presence in a particular geographic region certain of our competitors may be larger entities that have greater financial resources and greater overall brand name recognition than we do and as a result may be better positioned to impact customer behavior or adapt to changes in the industry or the economy as a whole certain competitors may also have direct or indirect access to sovereign capital andor other incentives which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time 

additionally depending on the geographic area certain potential customers may still be in the process of educating themselves about the points of differentiation among various available providers of pv solar energy solutions including a company’s proven overall experience and bankability system design and optimization expertise grid interconnection and stabilization expertise and proven om capabilities if we are unable over time to meaningfully differentiate our offerings at scale or if available competitive pricing is prioritized over the value we believe is added through our system offerings and experience from the viewpoint of our potential customer base our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

following an evaluation of the longterm cost structure competitiveness and riskadjusted returns of our om services business we received an offer to purchase certain portions of the business and determined it is in the best interest of our stockholders to pursue this transaction as a result in august 2020 we entered into an agreement with clairvest for the sale of our north american om operations the completion of the transaction is contingent on a number of closing conditions including the receipt of certain thirdparty consents and other customary closing conditions assuming satisfaction of such closing conditions we expect the sale to be completed in the first half of 2021 

following an evaluation of the longterm cost structure competitiveness and riskadjusted returns of our us project development business we have determined it is in the best interest of our stockholders to pursue the sale of this business on january 24 2021 we entered into an agreement with omers for the sale of our us project development operations which comprises the business of developing contracting for the construction of and selling utilityscale pv solar power systems the transaction includes our approximately 10 gw ac utilityscale solar project pipeline including the advancedstage horizon madison ridgely rabbitbrush and oak trail projects that are 

expected to commence construction in the next two years the 30 mw ac barilla solar project which is operational and certain other equipment in addition omers has agreed to certain module purchase commitments the completion of the transaction is contingent on a number of closing conditions including the receipt of regulatory approval from ferc the expiration of the mandatory waiting period under us antitrust laws a review of the transaction by cfius and other customary closing conditions assuming satisfaction of such closing conditions we expect the sale to be completed in the first half of 2021 

our systems business is largely dependent on us and third parties arranging financing from various sources which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms or in insufficient amounts 

the construction of large utilityscale solar power projects in many cases requires project financing including nonrecourse project specific debt financing in the bank loan market and institutional debt capital markets uncertainties exist as to whether our planned projects will be able to access the debt markets in a magnitude sufficient to finance their construction if we or purchasers of our projects are unable to arrange such financing or if it is only available on unfavorable terms we may be unable to fully execute our systems business plans in addition we generally expect to sell interests in our projects by raising project equity capital from taxoriented strategic industry and other equity investors such equity sources may not be available or may only be available in insufficient amounts or on unfavorable terms in which case our ability to sell interests in our projects may be delayed or limited and our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected uncertainty in or adverse changes to tax policy or tax law including the amount of itc or accelerated depreciation and any limitations on the value or availability to potential investors of tax incentives that benefit solar energy projects such as the itc and accelerated depreciation deductions as well as the reduction of the us corporate income tax rate to 21 under the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” which could reduce the value of these tax related incentives may reduce project values or negatively affect our ability to timely secure equity investment for our projects 

depending on prevailing conditions in the credit markets interest rates and other factors such financing may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms or in insufficient amounts if third parties are limited in their ability to access financing to support their purchase of system construction services from us we may not realize the cash flows that we expect from such sales which could adversely affect our ability to invest in our business andor generate revenue see also the risk factor above entitled “an increase in interest rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets including a reduction in total tax equity availability could make it difficult for customers to finance the cost of a pv solar power system and could reduce the demand for our modules or systems andor lead to a reduction in the average selling price for such offerings  ” 

developing solar power projects may require significant upfront investment prior to the signing of sales contracts which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

solar power project development cycles which span the time between the identification of a site location and the construction of a system vary substantially and can take years to mature as a result of these long project development cycles we may need to make significant upfront investments of resources including for example payments for land rights large transmission and ppa deposits or other payments which may be nonrefundable in advance of the signing of sales contracts receiving cash proceeds or recognizing any revenue our potential inability to enter into sales contracts with customers on favorable terms after making such upfront investments could cause us to forfeit certain nonrefundable payments or otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations furthermore we may become constrained in our ability to simultaneously fund our other business operations and these systems investments through our long project development cycles 

our liquidity may also be adversely affected to the extent the project sales market weakens and we are unable to sell interests in our solar projects on pricing timing and other terms commercially acceptable to us in such a scenario we may choose to continue to temporarily own and operate certain solar projects for a period of time after which interests in the projects may be sold to third parties 

we may be subject to unforeseen costs liabilities or obligations when providing om services in addition certain of our om agreements include provisions permitting the counterparty to terminate the agreement without cause 

we may provide ongoing om services to system owners under separate service agreements pursuant to which we generally perform standard activities associated with operating a pv solar power system including 247 monitoring and control compliance activities energy forecasting and scheduled and unscheduled maintenance our costs to perform these services are estimated at the time of entering into the om agreement for a particular project and these are reflected in the price we charge our customers including certain agreements which feature fixed pricing should our estimates of om costs prove inaccurate including any unexpected serial defects unavailability of parts or increases in inflation labor or bos costs our growth strategy and results of operations could be adversely affected because of the potentially longterm nature of these om agreements the adverse impacts on our results of operations could be significant up to our limitation of liability capped under the terms of the agreements in addition certain of our om agreements include provisions permitting the counterparty to terminate the agreement without cause or for convenience the exercise of such termination rights or the use of such rights as leverage to renegotiate terms and conditions of an om agreement including pricing terms could adversely impact our results of operations we may also be subject to substantial costs in the event we do not achieve certain thresholds under the effective availability guarantees included in our om agreements 

following an evaluation of the longterm cost structure competitiveness and riskadjusted returns of our om services business we received an offer to purchase certain portions of the business and determined it is in the best interest of our stockholders to pursue this transaction as a result in august 2020 we entered into an agreement with clairvest for the sale of our north american om operations the completion of the transaction is contingent on a number of closing conditions including the receipt of certain thirdparty consents and other customary closing conditions assuming satisfaction of such closing conditions we expect the sale to be completed in the first half of 2021 

our systems business is subject to regulatory oversight and liability if we fail to operate pv solar power systems in compliance with electric reliability rules 

the ongoing om services that we provide for system owners may subject us to regulation by the north american electric reliability corporation “nerc” or its designated regional representative as a generator operator “gop” under electric reliability rules filed with ferc our failure to comply with the reliability rules applicable to gops could subject us to substantial fines by nerc subject to ferc’s review in addition the system owners that receive our om services may be regulated by nerc as generator owners “go” and we may incur liability for go violations and fines levied by nerc subject to ferc’s review based on the terms of our om agreements as a system owner and operator we may in the future be subject to regulation by nerc as a go 

risks related to regulations 

existing regulations and policies changes thereto and new regulations and policies may present technical regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of pv solar products or systems which may significantly reduce demand for our modules systems or services 

the market for electricity generation products is heavily influenced by federal state local and foreign government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry as well as policies promulgated by electric utilities these regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and interconnection of customerowned electricity generation in the united states and in a number of other countries these regulations and policies have been modified in the past and may be modified again in the future these regulations and policies could deter enduser purchases of pv solar products or systems and investment in the rd of pv solar technology for example without a mandated regulatory exception for pv solar power systems system owners are often charged interconnection or standby fees for putting distributed power generation on the electric utility grid to the extent these interconnection standby fees are applicable to pv solar power systems it is likely that they would increase the cost of such systems which could make the systems less desirable thereby adversely affecting our business financial condition and results of operations in addition with respect to utilities that utilize a peakhour pricing policy or timeofuse pricing methods whereby the price of electricity is adjusted based on electricity supply and demand electricity generated by pv solar power systems currently benefits from competing primarily with expensive peakhour electricity rather than the less expensive average price of electricity modifications to the peakhour pricing policies of utilities such as to a flat rate for all times of the day would require pv solar power systems to have lower prices in order to compete with the price of electricity from other sources which could adversely impact our operating results 

our modules systems and services are often subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with national and local ordinances relating to building codes safety environmental protection utility interconnection and metering and other matters and tracking the requirements of individual jurisdictions is complex any new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to our modules systems or services may result in significant additional expenses to us or our customers and as a result could cause a significant reduction in demand for our modules systems or services in addition any regulatory compliance failure could result in significant management distraction unplanned costs andor reputational damage 

we could be adversely affected by any violations of the fcpa the uk bribery act and other foreign antibribery laws  

the fcpa generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business other countries in which we operate also have antibribery laws some of which prohibit improper payments to government and nongovernment persons and entities and others eg the fcpa and the uk bribery act extend their application to activities outside their country of origin our policies mandate compliance with all applicable antibribery laws we currently operate in and may further expand into key parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices in addition due to the level of regulation in our industry our operations in certain jurisdictions including china india south america and the middle east require substantial government contact either directly by us or through intermediaries over whom we have less direct control such as subcontractors agents and partners such as joint venture partners where norms can differ from us standards although we have implemented policies procedures and in certain cases contractual arrangements designed to facilitate compliance with these antibribery laws our officers directors associates subcontractors agents and partners may take actions in violation of our policies procedures contractual arrangements and antibribery laws any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could subject us and such persons to criminal andor civil penalties or other sanctions potentially by government prosecutors from more than one country which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and reputation 

environmental obligations and liabilities could have a substantial negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations involve the use handling generation processing storage transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations at the national state local and international levels these environmental laws and regulations include those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the use management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites and occupational health and safety as we expand our business into foreign jurisdictions worldwide our environmental compliance burden may continue to increase both in terms of magnitude and complexity we have incurred and may continue to incur significant costs in complying with these laws and regulations in addition violations of or liabilities under environmental laws or permits may result in restrictions being imposed on our operating activities or in our being subject to substantial fines penalties criminal proceedings thirdparty property damage or personal injury claims cleanup costs or other costs while we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements future developments such as more aggressive enforcement policies the implementation of new more stringent laws and regulations or the discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our solar modules contain cdte and other semiconductor materials elemental cadmium and certain of its compounds are regulated as hazardous materials due to the adverse health effects that may arise from human exposure based on existing research the risks of exposure to cdte are not believed to be as serious as those relating to exposure to elemental cadmium due to cdte’s limited bioavailability in our manufacturing operations we maintain engineering controls to minimize our associates’ exposure to cadmium compounds and require our associates who handle cadmium compounds to follow certain safety procedures including the use of personal protective equipment such as respirators chemical goggles and protective clothing relevant studies and thirdparty peer reviews of our technology have concluded that the risk of exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds from our endproducts is negligible in addition the risk of exposure is further minimized by the encapsulated nature of these materials in our products the physical properties of cadmium compounds used in our products and the recycling or responsible disposal of our modules while we believe that these factors and procedures are sufficient to protect our associates end users and the general public from adverse health effects that may arise from cadmium exposure we cannot ensure that human or environmental exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds used in our products will not occur any such exposure could result in future thirdparty claims against us damage to our reputation and heightened regulatory scrutiny which could limit or impair our ability to sell and distribute our products the occurrence of future events such as these could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the use of cadmium or cadmium compounds in various products is also coming under increasingly stringent governmental regulation future regulation in this area could impact the manufacturing sale collection and recycling of solar modules and could require us to make unforeseen environmental expenditures or limit our ability to sell and distribute our products for example european union directive 201165eu on the restriction of the use of hazardous substances “rohs” in electrical and electronic equipment the “rohs directive” restricts the use of certain hazardous substances including cadmium and its compounds in specified products other jurisdictions such as china have adopted similar legislation or are considering doing so currently pv solar modules are explicitly excluded from the scope of rohs article 2 as adopted by the european parliament and the council in june 2011 the next general review of the rohs directive is scheduled for 2021 involving a broader discussion of the existing scope in preparation for the next rohs revision the european commission has started a number of preregulatory studies and assessments relating to the addition of new substances to the existing rohs framework as well as the revision and optimization of the exemption process it is unclear to what extent the existing scope exclusions will be discussed or maintained in future directives if pv modules were to be included in the scope of future rohs revisions without an exemption or exclusion we would be required to redesign our solar modules to reduce cadmium and other affected hazardous substances to the maximum allowable concentration thresholds in the rohs directive in order to continue to offer them for sale within the eu as such actions would be 

impractical this type of regulatory development would effectively close the eu market to us which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic could materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

the covid19 pandemic has continued to have an unprecedented impact on the united states malaysia and other countries throughout the world including those in which we do business or have operations although as of the date of this filing we have not been materially impacted by the covid19 pandemic the pandemic could materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations in the future the extent to which the covid19 pandemic could impact us continues to be highly uncertain and cannot be predicted and will depend largely on subsequent developments including the severity and duration of the pandemic measures taken to contain the spread of the virus such as restrictions on travel and gatherings of people and temporary closures of or limitations on businesses and other commercial activities and the timing and nature of policies implemented by governmental authorities to ease such measures 

as a result of the covid19 pandemic and these related containment measures and reopening policies we may be subject to significant risks which have the potential to materially and adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations including the following 

• the continued economic disruption caused by the covid19 pandemic may result in a longterm tightening of the supply of capital in global financial markets including in the united states a reduction in total tax equity availability which could make it difficult for purchasers of our modules or our development projects to secure the debt or equity capital necessary to finance a pv solar power system thereby delaying or reducing demand for our modules or these projects 

• purchasers of pv modules may delay module procurement in response to the covid19 pandemic which may result in additional pressure on global demand and average selling prices for modules and may exacerbate structural imbalances between global pv module supply and demand 

• we may at any time be ordered by governmental authorities or we may determine based on our understanding of the recommendations or orders of governmental authorities that we have to curtail or cease business operations or activities including manufacturing 

• the failure of our suppliers or vendors to supply materials or equipment or the failure of our vendors to install repair or replace our specialized equipment due to the covid19 pandemic related containment measures or limitations on logistics providers’ ability to operate may idle slowdown shutdown or otherwise cause us to adjust our manufacturing capacity we have incurred manufacturing charges associated with the ongoing covid19 pandemic 

• the covid19 pandemic and related containment measures may result in us incurring delays in obtaining or failing to obtain the approvals or rights that are required for our development projects to proceed such as permitting interconnection or land usage approvals or rights and the covid19 pandemic and related containment measures may delay or prevent the performance by third parties of activities related to the development of these projects such as interconnection engineering procurement construction and other activities 

• we perform substantial rd to continue to improve our module wattage or conversion efficiency lower our module cost per watt lower the overall lcoe of our pv solar power systems and otherwise keep pace with technological advances in the solar industry the covid19 pandemic and related containment 

measures including the unavailability of our personnel and thirdparty partners who are engaged in rd activities may inhibit our rd efforts or our ability to timely advance or commercialize these efforts and 

• in response to the covid19 pandemic the vast majority of our associates who are capable of performing their function remotely are telecommuting ie working from home while we have instituted security measures to minimize the likelihood and impact of a cybersecurity incident with respect to associates utilizing technological communications tools these measures may be inadequate to prevent a cybersecurity breach because of the unprecedented number of associates continuously using these tools recently there have been reports of a surge in widespread cyberattacks during the covid19 pandemic any increase in the frequency or scope of cyberattacks during the covid19 pandemic may exacerbate the aforementioned cybersecurity risks in addition while we have among other things established enhanced cleaning procedures at our facilities and protocols for responding when our associates are infected we cannot assure these will be sufficient to mitigate the risks faced by our work force or the liability we may face as a result of any outbreaks of covid19 

if the severity and duration of the covid19 pandemic does not abate and related containment measures are not lifted are eased more slowly than anticipated or are reinstituted many of the other risks described herein may have a significant impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

general risk factors 

if our longlived assets or project related assets become impaired we may be required to record significant charges to earnings 

we may be required to record significant charges to earnings should we determine that our longlived assets or project related assets are impaired such charges may have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations we review longlived and project related assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable we consider a project commercially viable or recoverable if it is anticipated to be sold for a profit once it is either fully developed or fully constructed or if the expected operating cash flows from future power generation exceed the cost basis of the asset if our projects are not considered commercially viable we would be required to impair the respective assets 

our credit agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business 

we may be unable to respond to changes in business and economic conditions engage in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us and obtain additional financing if needed because the senior secured credit facility made available under our amended and restated credit agreement with several financial institutions as lenders and jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent the “revolving credit facility” and certain of our project financing arrangements contain and other future debt agreements may contain covenant restrictions that limit our ability to among other things 

• incur additional debt assume obligations in connection with letters of credit or issue guarantees 

• create liens 

• enter into certain transactions with our affiliates 

• sell certain assets and 

• declare or pay dividends make other distributions to stockholders or make other restricted payments 

under our revolving credit facility and certain of our project financing arrangements we are also subject to certain financial covenants our ability to comply with covenants under our credit agreements is dependent on our future performance or the performance of specifically financed projects which will be subject to many factors some of which are beyond our control including prevailing economic conditions in addition our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under these agreements and any of our other future debt agreements which if not cured or waived could permit the holders thereof to accelerate such debt and could cause crossdefaults under our other facility agreements and the possible acceleration of debt under such agreements as well as crossdefaults under certain of our key project and operational agreements and could also result in requirements to post additional security instruments to secure future obligations in addition certain events that occur within the company or in the industry or the economy as a whole may constitute material adverse effects under these agreements if it is determined that a material adverse effect has occurred the lenders can under certain circumstances restrict future borrowings or accelerate the due date of outstanding amounts if any of our debt is accelerated we may experience crossdefaults under our other debt or operational agreements which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

cyberattacks or other breaches of our information systems or those of third parties with which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations rely on our computer systems hardware software and networks as well as those of third parties with which we do business to securely process store and transmit proprietary confidential and other information including intellectual property we also rely heavily on these information systems to operate our manufacturing lines and pv solar power plants these information systems may be compromised by cyberattacks computer viruses and other events that could be materially disruptive to our business operations and could put the security of our information and that of the third parties with which we do business at risk of misappropriation or destruction in recent years such cyber incidents have become increasingly frequent and sophisticated targeting or otherwise affecting a wide range of companies while we have instituted security measures to minimize the likelihood and impact of a cyber incident there is no assurance that these measures or those of the third parties with which we do business will be adequate in the future if these measures fail valuable information may be lost our manufacturing development construction om and other operations may be disrupted we may be unable to fulfill our customer obligations and our reputation may suffer for example any cyber incident affecting our automated manufacturing lines could adversely affect our ability to produce solar modules or otherwise affect the quality and performance of the modules produced we may also be subject to litigation regulatory action remedial expenses and financial losses beyond the scope or limits of our insurance coverage these consequences of a failure of security measures could individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as a result of the covid19 pandemic the vast majority of our associates who are capable of performing their function remotely are telecommuting which may exacerbate the aforementioned cybersecurity risks see the risk factor entitled “the covid19 pandemic could materially impact our business financial condition and results of operations” 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future business combinations or acquisition transactions and integration of business combinations may disrupt our business and management 

we have made several acquisitions in prior years and in the future we may acquire additional companies project pipelines products equity interests or technologies or enter into joint ventures or other strategic initiatives we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such business combinations or acquisitions and each transaction has numerous risks which may include the following 

• difficulty in assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired or partner company 

• difficulty in effectively integrating the acquired products or technologies with our current products or technologies 

• difficulty in achieving profitable commercial scale from acquired technologies 

• difficulty in maintaining controls procedures and policies during the transition and integration 

• disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and associates from other opportunities and challenges due to integration issues 

• difficulty integrating the acquired or partner company’s accounting management information and other administrative systems 

• difficulty managing joint ventures with our partners potential litigation with joint venture partners and reliance upon joint ventures that we do not control 

• inability to retain key technical and managerial personnel of the acquired business 

• inability to retain key customers vendors and other business partners of the acquired business 

• inability to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses as a result of insufficient capital resources or otherwise 

• incurring acquisitionrelated costs or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets that could impact our operating results 

• potential impairment of our relationships with our associates customers partners distributors or thirdparty providers of products or technologies 

• potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant issues with product quality legal and financial liabilities among other things 

• potential inability to assert that internal controls over financial reporting are effective 

• potential inability to obtain or obtain in a timely manner approvals from governmental authorities which could delay or prevent such acquisitions and 

• potential delay in customer purchasing decisions due to uncertainty about the direction of our product offerings 

mergers and acquisitions of companies are inherently risky and ultimately if we do not complete the integration of acquired businesses successfully and in a timely manner we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions to the extent anticipated which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations in addition we may seek to dispose of our interests in acquired companies project pipelines products or technologies we may not recover our initial investment in such interests in part or at all which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our future success depends on our ability to retain our key associates and to successfully integrate them into our management team 

we are dependent on the services of our executive officers and other members of our senior management team the loss of one or more of these key associates or any other member of our senior management team could have a 

material adverse effect on our business we may not be able to retain or replace these key associates and may not have adequate succession plans in place several of our current key associates including our executive officers are subject to employment conditions or arrangements that contain postemployment noncompetition provisions however these arrangements permit the associates to terminate their employment with us upon little or no notice 

if we are unable to attract train and retain key personnel our business may be materially and adversely affected 

our future success depends to a significant extent on our ability to attract train and retain management operations sales and technical personnel including personnel in foreign jurisdictions recruiting and retaining capable personnel particularly those with expertise in the pv solar industry across a variety of technologies are vital to our success there is substantial competition for qualified technical personnel and while we continue to benchmark our organization against the broad spectrum of business in our market space to remain economically competitive there can be no assurances that we will be able to attract and retain our technical personnel if we are unable to attract and retain qualified associates or otherwise experience unexpected labor disruptions within our business we may be materially and adversely affected 

we may be exposed to infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties which if determined adversely to us could cause us to pay significant damage awards or prohibit us from the manufacture and sale of our solar modules or the use of our technology 

our success depends largely on our ability to use and develop our technology and knowhow without infringing or misappropriating the intellectual property rights of third parties the validity and scope of claims relating to pv solar technology patents involve complex scientific legal and factual considerations and analysis and therefore may be highly uncertain we may be subject to litigation involving claims of patent infringement or violation of intellectual property rights of third parties the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits patent opposition proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings can be both costly and time consuming and may significantly divert the efforts and resources of our technical and management personnel an adverse determination in any such litigation or proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liability to third parties require us to seek licenses from third parties which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all or pay ongoing royalties require us to redesign our solar modules or subject us to injunctions prohibiting the manufacture and sale of our solar modules or the use of our technologies protracted litigation could also result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of our solar modules until the resolution of such litigation 

currency translation and transaction risk may negatively affect our results of operations 

although our reporting currency is the us dollar we conduct certain business and incur costs in the local currency of most countries in which we operate as a result we are subject to currency translation and transaction risk for example certain of our net sales in 2020 were denominated in foreign currencies such as japanese yen and euro and we expect to continue to have net sales denominated in foreign currencies in the future joint ventures or other business arrangements with strategic partners outside the united states have involved and in the future may involve significant investments denominated in local currencies changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar could affect our results of operations and result in exchange gains or losses we cannot accurately predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations 

we could also expand our business into emerging markets many of which have an uncertain regulatory environment relating to currency policy conducting business in such emerging markets could cause our exposure to changes in exchange rates to increase due to the relatively high volatility associated with emerging market currencies and potentially longer payment terms for our proceeds 

our ability to hedge foreign currency exposure is dependent on our credit profile with the banks that are willing and able to do business with us deterioration in our credit position or a significant tightening of the credit market 

conditions could limit our ability to hedge our foreign currency exposures and therefore result in exchange gains or losses 

unanticipated changes in our tax provision the enactment of new tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the jurisdictions in which we operate in march 2020 the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the “cares act” was signed into law the changes included in the cares act are broad and complex and the final effects of the cares act may differ from the amounts provided elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k possibly materially due to among other things changes in regulations related to the cares act any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the cares act any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the cares act or actions we may take as a result of the cares act additionally longstanding international tax laws that determine each country’s jurisdictional tax rights in crossborder international trade continue to evolve as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting reporting requirements recommended by the oecd as these and other tax laws and regulations change our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we are subject to potential tax examinations in various jurisdictions and taxing authorities may disagree with our interpretations of us and foreign tax laws and may assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these examinations in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however the outcome of tax examinations cannot be predicted with certainty therefore the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of such examinations could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision which could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

in addition our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure losses of tax holidays changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings among countries with tax holidays or differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process any changes in our effective tax rate may materially and adversely impact our results of operations 

we have been and may be subject to or involved in litigation or threatened litigation the outcome of which may be difficult to predict and which may be costly to defend divert management attention require us to pay damages or restrict the operation of our business 

from time to time we have been and may be subject to disputes and litigation with and without merit that may be costly and which may divert the attention of our management and our resources in general whether or not any dispute actually proceeds to litigation the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict moreover complaints filed against us may not specify the amount of damages that plaintiffs seek and we therefore may be unable to estimate the possible range of damages that might be incurred should these lawsuits be resolved against us even if we are able to estimate losses related to these actions the ultimate amount of loss may be materially higher than our estimates any resolution of litigation or threatened litigation could involve the payment of damages or expenses by us which may be significant involve an agreement with terms that restrict the operation of our business or adversely impact our ability to proceed with the construction or sale of a given project even if any future lawsuits are not resolved against us the costs of defending such lawsuits may be significant these costs may exceed the dollar limits of our insurance policies or may not be covered at all by our insurance policies because the price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile we can provide no assurance that additional securities or other litigation will not be filed against us in the future see note 13 “commitments and contingencies – legal proceedings” to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our legal proceedings 

changes in or any failure to comply with privacy laws regulations and standards may adversely affect our business 

personal privacy and data security have become significant issues in the united states europe and in many other jurisdictions in which we operate the regulatory framework for privacy and security issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future furthermore federal state or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted and may in the future adopt laws and regulations affecting data privacy all of which may be subject to invalidation by relevant foreign judicial bodies industry organizations also regularly adopt and advocate for new standards in this area 

in the united states these include rules and regulations promulgated or pending under the authority of federal agencies state attorneys general legislatures and consumer protection agencies internationally many jurisdictions in which we operate have established their own data security and privacy legal framework with which we relevant suppliers and customers must comply for example the general data protection regulation a broadbased data privacy regime enacted by the european parliament which became effective in may 2018 imposes new requirements on how we collect process transfer and store personal data and also imposes additional obligations potential penalties and risk upon our business additionally the california consumer privacy act which became effective in january 2020 imposes similar data privacy requirements in many jurisdictions enforcement actions and consequences for noncompliance are also rising in addition to government regulation privacy advocates and industry groups may propose new and different selfregulatory standards that either legally or contractually apply to us although we have implemented policies procedures and in certain cases contractual arrangements designed to facilitate compliance with applicable privacy and data security laws and standards any inability or perceived inability to adequately address privacy and security concerns even if unfounded or comply with applicable privacy and data security laws regulations and policies could result in additional fines costs and liabilities to us damage our reputation inhibit sales and adversely affect our business

executive overview 

we are a leading global provider of pv solar energy solutions we design manufacture and sell pv solar modules with an advanced thin film semiconductor technology and also develop and sell pv solar power systems that primarily use the modules we manufacture additionally in certain markets we provide om services to system owners we have substantial ongoing rd efforts focused on various technology innovations we are the world’s largest thin film pv solar module manufacturer and one of the world’s largest pv solar module manufacturers 

certain of our financial results and other key operational developments for the year ended december 31 2020 include the following 

• net sales for 2020 decreased by 11 to 27 billion compared to 31 billion in 2019 the decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to the completion of substantially all construction activities at the sun streams phoebe sunshine valley rosamond seabrook and lake hancock projects in 2019 the sale of the beryl and little bear projects in 2019 and lower construction activities at the ga solar 4 project in the current period partially offset by the sale of the ishikawa american kings miyagi anamizu tungabhadra and anantapur projects in 2020 and an increase in the volume of modules sold to third parties 

• gross profit increased 72 percentage points to 251 during 2020 from 179 during 2019 primarily due to higher gross profit on thirdparty module sales and improved throughput of our manufacturing facilities from the successful ramp of various series 6 manufacturing lines partially offset by the higher benefit from reductions to our product warranty liability in the prior period and an impairment loss for certain module manufacturing equipment 

• during late 2020 we completed the capacity expansion of our manufacturing facility in perrysburg ohio as of december 31 2020 we had 63 gw dc of total installed series 6 nameplate production capacity across all our facilities we produced 61 gw dc of solar modules during 2020 which represented a 59 increase in series 6 module production from 2019 the increase in series 6 production was primarily driven by the production capacity added in 2019 at our second facility in ho chi minh city vietnam and our facility in lake township ohio as well as higher throughput at various facilities we expect to produce between 74 gw dc and 76 gw dc of series 6 modules during 2021 

• in response to the covid19 pandemic governmental authorities have recommended or ordered the limitation or cessation of certain business or commercial activities in jurisdictions in which we operate including the united states malaysia and vietnam at this time such limitations have had limited effect on our series 6 manufacturing facilities however these orders are subject to continuous revision and our 

understanding of the applicability of these orders and any potential exemptions may change at any time to enable the continuity of our operations we have implemented a wide range of safety measures intended to inhibit the spread of covid19 at our manufacturing administrative and other sites and facilities 

• following an evaluation of the longterm cost structure competitiveness and riskadjusted returns of our om services business we received an offer to purchase certain portions of the business and determined it is in the best interest of our stockholders to pursue this transaction as a result in august 2020 we entered into an agreement with clairvest for the sale of our north american om operations the completion of the transaction is contingent on a number of closing conditions including the receipt of certain thirdparty consents and other customary closing conditions assuming satisfaction of such closing conditions we expect the sale to be completed in the first half of 2021 

• following an evaluation of the longterm cost structure competitiveness and riskadjusted returns of our us project development business we have determined it is in the best interest of our stockholders to pursue the sale of this business on january 24 2021 we entered into an agreement with omers for the sale of our us project development operations which comprises the business of developing contracting for the construction of and selling utilityscale pv solar power systems the transaction includes our approximately 10 gw ac utilityscale solar project pipeline including the advancedstage horizon madison ridgely rabbitbrush and oak trail projects that are expected to commence construction in the next two years the 30 mw ac barilla solar project which is operational and certain other equipment in addition omers has agreed to certain module purchase commitments the completion of the transaction is contingent on a number of closing conditions including the receipt of regulatory approval from ferc the expiration of the mandatory waiting period under us antitrust laws a review of the transaction by cfius and other customary closing conditions assuming satisfaction of such closing conditions we expect the sale to be completed in the first half of 2021 

• in january 2020 we entered into a memorandum of understanding “mou” to settle a class action lawsuit filed in 2012 in the united states district court for the district of arizona hereafter “arizona district court” against the company and certain of our current and former officers and directors the “class action” pursuant to the mou we paid a total of 350 million to settle the claims brought on behalf of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired the company’s shares during a specified period in exchange for mutual releases and a dismissal with prejudice of the complaint upon court approval of the settlement the settlement contained no admission of liability wrongdoing or responsibility by any of the parties the arizona district court entered an order in june 2020 that granted final approval of the settlement and dismissed the class action with prejudice 

• in june 2020 we entered into an agreement in principle to settle certain claims filed in 2015 in the arizona district court by putative stockholders that opted out of the class action the “optout action” in july 2020 the parties executed a definitive settlement agreement pursuant to which we agreed to pay a total of 19 million in exchange for mutual releases and a dismissal with prejudice of the optout action the agreement contained no admission of liability wrongdoing or responsibility by any of the parties in july 2020 first solar funded the settlement and the parties filed a joint stipulation of dismissal in september 2020 the arizona district court entered an order dismissing the case with prejudice 

market overview 

the solar industry continues to be characterized by intense pricing competition both at the module and system levels in particular module average selling prices in many global markets have declined in recent years and are expected to continue to decline in the future furthermore the covid19 pandemic has adversely affected certain purchasers of modules and systems which may result in additional pressure on demand and average selling prices in the aggregate we believe manufacturers of solar cells and modules have significant installed production capacity relative to global demand and the ability for additional capacity expansion accordingly we believe the solar 

industry may from time to time experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity exceeds global demand and that such periods will also put pressure on pricing which may be exacerbated by the covid19 pandemic’s disruption of the global economy additionally intense competition at the system level may result in an environment in which pricing falls rapidly thereby potentially increasing demand for solar energy solutions but constraining the ability for project developers and diversified module manufacturers to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability in light of such market realities we continue to focus on our strategies and points of differentiation which include our advanced module technology our manufacturing process our diversified capabilities our financial viability and the sustainability advantage of our modules and systems 

global solar markets continue to expand and develop in part aided by demand elasticity resulting from declining average selling prices both at the module and system levels which have promoted the widespread adoption of solar energy as a result of such market opportunities we are expanding our manufacturing capacity and developing solar projects in certain markets as we execute on our utilityscale project pipeline see the tables under “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – systems project pipeline” for additional information about projects within our advancedstage pipeline although we expect a meaningful portion of our future consolidated net sales operating income and cash flows to be derived from such projects we expect thirdparty module sales to continue to have a more significant impact on our operating results as we expand capacity and leverage the benefits of our series 6 module technology 

lower industry module and system pricing is expected to contribute to diversification in global electricity generation and further demand for solar energy over time however declining average selling prices may adversely affect our results of operations to the extent we have not already entered into contracts for future module or system sales our results of operations could also be adversely affected if competitors reduce pricing to levels below their costs bid aggressively low prices for module sale agreements or ppas or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time for certain of our competitors such actions may be enabled by their direct or indirect access to sovereign capital or other forms of stateowned support in certain markets in california and elsewhere an oversupply imbalance at the grid level may reduce shorttomedium term demand for new solar installations relative to prior years lower ppa pricing and lower margins on module and system sales to such markets however we believe the effects of such imbalance can be mitigated by modern solar power plants and energy storage solutions that offer a flexible operating profile thereby promoting greater grid stability and enabling a higher penetration of solar energy we continue to address these uncertainties in part by executing on our module technology improvements partnering with grid operators and utility companies and implementing certain other cost reduction initiatives 

we face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules and developers of solar power projects solar module manufacturers compete with one another on price and on several module value attributes including wattage through a larger form factor or an improved conversion efficiency energy yield and reliability and developers of systems compete on various factors such as net present value return on equity and lcoe many crystalline silicon cell and wafer manufacturers have transitioned from lower efficiency bsf multicrystalline cells the legacy technology against which we have generally competed to higher efficiency perc monocrystalline cells at competitive cost structures additionally while conventional solar modules including the solar modules we produce are monofacial meaning their ability to produce energy is a function of direct and diffuse irradiance on their front side certain manufacturers of monocrystalline perc modules offer bifacial modules that also capture diffuse irradiance on the back side of a module the cost effective manufacture of bifacial perc modules has been enabled in part by the expansion of inexpensive crystal growth and diamond wire saw capacity in china bifaciality compromises nameplate efficiency but by converting both front and rear side irradiance such technology may improve the overall energy production of a module relative to nameplate efficiency when applied in certain applications which after considering the incremental bos and other costs could potentially lower the overall lcoe of a system when compared to systems using conventional solar modules including the modules we produce 

we believe we are among the lowest cost module manufacturers in the solar industry on a module cost per watt basis based on publicly available information this cost competitiveness allows us to compete favorably in markets 

where pricing for modules and systems is highly competitive our cost competitiveness is based in large part on our advanced thinfilm semiconductor technology module wattage or conversion efficiency proprietary manufacturing process which enables us to produce a cdte module in a matter of hours using a continuous and highly automated industrial manufacturing process as opposed to a batch process and our focus on operational excellence in addition our cdte modules use approximately 12 of the amount of semiconductor material that is used to manufacture conventional crystalline silicon solar modules the cost of polysilicon is a significant driver of the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules and the timing and rate of change in the cost of silicon feedstock and polysilicon could lead to changes in solar module pricing levels in recent years polysilicon consumption per cell has been reduced through various initiatives such as the adoption of diamond wire saw technology which have contributed to declines in our relative manufacturing cost competitiveness over conventional crystalline silicon module manufacturers 

in terms of energy yield in many climates our cdte solar modules provide an energy production advantage over crystalline silicon solar modules of equivalent efficiency rating for example our cdte solar modules provide a superior temperature coefficient which results in stronger system performance in typical high insolation climates as the majority of a system’s generation on average occurs when module temperatures are well above 25°c standard test conditions in addition our cdte solar modules provide a superior spectral response in humid environments where atmospheric moisture alters the solar spectrum relative to laboratory standards our cdte solar modules also provide a better partial shading response than conventional crystalline silicon solar modules which may experience significantly lower energy generation than cdte solar modules when partial shading occurs as a result of these and other factors our pv solar modules typically produce more annual energy in real world field conditions than conventional modules with the same nameplate capacity furthermore our thinfilm cdte semiconductor technology is immune to cell cracking and its resulting power output loss a common failure often observed in crystalline silicon modules caused by poor manufacturing handling weather or other conditions 

while our modules and systems are generally competitive in cost reliability and performance attributes there can be no guarantee such competitiveness will continue to exist in the future to the same extent or at all any declines in the competitiveness of our products could result in further declines in the average selling prices of our modules and systems and additional margin compression we continue to focus on enhancing the competitiveness of our solar modules and systems by accelerating progress along our module technology and cost reduction roadmaps 

certain trends and uncertainties 

we believe that our business financial condition and results of operations may be favorably or unfavorably impacted by the following trends and uncertainties see item 1a “risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for discussions of other risks that may affect us 

our longterm strategic plans are focused on our goal to create longterm shareholder value through a balance of growth profitability and liquidity in executing such plans we are focusing on providing utilityscale pv solar energy solutions in key geographic markets that we believe have a compelling need for massscale pv solar electricity including markets throughout the united states japan europe india and certain other strategic markets while these markets are expected to exhibit strong longterm demand for solar energy the economic disruption caused by the covid19 pandemic has adversely affected nearterm demand for electricity at the grid level as a result such temporary decline in load may adversely affect demand for specific forms of generation such as our pv solar energy solutions depending on the severity and duration of the economic disruption given these market dynamics we continue to focus on opportunities in which our pv solar energy solutions compete directly with traditional forms of energy generation on an lcoe or similar basis or complement such generation offerings these opportunities include the retirement and replacement of aging fossil fuelbased generation resources with utilityscale pv solar energy solutions for example cumulative global retirements of coal generation plants are expected to approximate 900 gw dc by 2040 representing a significant increase in the potential market for solar energy 

this focus on our core module and utilityscale offerings exists within a current market environment that includes rooftop and distributed generation solar particularly in the united states while it is unclear how rooftop and distributed generation solar might impact our core utilityscale based offerings over the next several years we believe that utilityscale solar will continue to be a compelling offering for companies with technology and cost leadership and will continue to represent an increasing portion of the overall electricity generation mix however our module offerings in certain international markets may be driven in part by future demand for rooftop and distributed generation solar solutions 

our ability to provide utilityscale offerings on economically attractive terms depends in part on market factors outside our control such as the availability of debt andor equity financing including in the united states tax equity financing interest rate fluctuations domestic or international trade policies and government support programs adverse changes in these factors could increase the cost of utilityscale systems which could reduce demand for such systems and limit the number of potential buyers for example we generally sell projects we have developed within our systems business to purchasers that depend on financing to fund the initial capital expenditures required to develop build andor purchase a system although governments and central banks around the world have implemented significant measures to support capital markets the economic disruption caused by the covid19 pandemic may result in a longterm tightening of the supply of capital in global financial markets including in the united states a reduction in total tax equity availability a reduction in the supply of project debt or equity financing including in the united states tax equity financing caused by the covid19 pandemic could make it difficult for our customers to secure the financing necessary to develop build purchase or install systems similarly purchasers of modules may cease or significantly reduce business operations cease or delay module procurement encounter an inability to obtain financing including due to a reduction in the supply of project debt financing or equity investments including in the united states tax equity financing conserve capital resources or take other actions in response to the covid19 pandemic which may reduce demand and average selling prices for our modules 

in certain markets demand for our utilityscale offerings may be affected by specific regulations or policies of governmental bodies or utility regulators for example in june 2020 the japanese legislature enacted an amendment to the electricity business law enforcement order for the ministry of economy trade and industry of japan which among other things is expected to invalidate the feedintariff certificates for projects that fail to achieve construction plan acceptance submit an interconnection application andor achieve commercial operation within a set period of time following dates specified in their respective certificates the amendment which becomes effective in april 2022 applies to all projects regardless of generation type and is intended to release grid capacity reserved for delayed projects to enable other newly developed projects to utilize such capacity at a lower cost of electricity to consumers the deadline by which a project must achieve construction plan acceptance submit an interconnection application andor achieve commercial operation varies by project but is no earlier than march 2023 any deadlines that precede the expected construction plan acceptance andor commercial operation dates of our various projects in japan could adversely affect the value of such projects and our ability to secure any related project financing 

we intend to focus our resources in those markets and energy applications in which solar power can be a leastcost bestfit energy solution particularly in regions with significant current or projected electricity demand relatively high existing electricity prices strong demand for renewable energy generation and high solar resources as a result we closely evaluate and monitor the appropriate level of resources required to support such markets and their associated sales opportunities we have dedicated and intend to continue to dedicate significant capital and human resources to reduce the total installed cost of pv solar energy and to ensure that our solutions integrate well into the overall electricity ecosystem of each specific market 

creating or maintaining a market position in certain strategically targeted markets and energy applications also requires us to adapt to new and changing market conditions including changes in the market set of potential buyers of our modules and solar projects market environments with few potential project buyers and a higher cost of capital would generally exert downward pressure on the potential revenue from such offerings whereas conversely market environments with many potential project buyers and a lower cost of capital would likely have a favorable 

impact on the potential revenue from such offerings for example the emergence of utilityowned generation has increased the number of potential project buyers as such utility customers benefit from a potentially low cost of capital available through ratebased utility investments given their longterm ownership profile utilityowned generation customers typically seek to partner with diversified and stable companies that can provide a broad spectrum of utilityscale generation solutions including reliable pv solar technology thereby mitigating their longterm ownership risks 

on occasion we may elect to develop partially contracted or uncontracted systems for which there is a partial or no ppa with an offtaker such as a utility but rather an intent to sell some portion of the electricity produced by the system on an open contract basis until the system is sold expected revenue from projects without a ppa for the full offtake of the system is subject to greater variability and uncertainty based on market factors and is typically lower than projects with a ppa for the full offtake of the system furthermore all system pricing is affected by the pricing of energy to be sold on an open contract basis following the termination of the ppa ie merchant pricing curves and changes in market assumptions regarding future open contract sales including potential changes in energy demand caused by the covid19 pandemic may also result in significant variability and uncertainty in the value of our systems projects 

we continually evaluate forecasted global demand competition and our addressable market and seek to effectively balance manufacturing capacity with market demand and the nature and extent of our competition we continue to increase the nameplate production capacity of our existing manufacturing facilities by improving our production throughput increasing module wattage or conversion efficiency and improving manufacturing yield losses as we evaluate the potential for future capacity expansion we may also seek to further diversify our manufacturing presence although we have made no decisions to do so at this time such additional capacity and any other potential investments to add or otherwise modify our existing manufacturing capacity in response to market demand and competition may require significant internal and possibly external sources of capital and may be subject to certain risks and uncertainties described in item 1a “risk factors” including those described under the headings “our future success depends on our ability to effectively balance manufacturing production with market demand convert existing production facilities to support new product lines decrease our cost per watt and when necessary continue to build new manufacturing plants over time in response to market demand all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties” and “if any future production lines are not built in line with committed schedules it may adversely affect our future growth plans if any future production lines do not achieve operating metrics similar to our existing production lines our solar modules could perform below expectations and cause us to lose customers” 

in response to the covid19 pandemic governmental authorities have recommended or ordered the limitation or cessation of certain business or commercial activities in jurisdictions in which we do business or have operations while some of these orders permit the continuation of essential business operations or permit the performance of minimum business activities these orders are subject to continuous revision or may be revoked or superseded or our understanding of the applicability of these orders and exemptions may change at any time in addition due to contraction of the virus or concerns about becoming ill from the virus we may experience reductions in the availability of our operational workforce such as our manufacturing personnel as a result we may at any time be ordered by governmental authorities or we may determine based on our understanding of the recommendations or orders of governmental authorities or the availability of our personnel that we have to curtail or cease business operations or activities altogether including manufacturing fulfillment project development construction operating or maintenance operations or research and development activities at this time such limitations have had a limited effect on our manufacturing facilities and certain project construction activities and we have implemented a wide range of safety measures intended to enable the continuity of our operations and inhibit the spread of covid19 at our manufacturing administrative and other sites and facilities including those in the united states malaysia and vietnam 

to address the nearterm business disruption caused by the covid19 pandemic many governments have proposed policies or support programs intended to stimulate their respective economies such support programs may include additional incentives for renewable energy projects including pv solar power systems over several years while we 

compete in many markets that do not require solarspecific government subsidies or support programs our net sales and profits remain subject to variability based on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives 

systems project pipeline 

the following tables summarize as of february 25 2021 our approximately 13 gw ac advancedstage project pipeline the actual volume of modules installed in our projects will be greater than the project size in mw ac as module volumes required for a project are based upon mw dc  which will be greater than the mw ac size pursuant to a dcac ratio typically ranging from 11 to 14 such ratio varies across different projects due to many factors including ppa pricing and the location design and costs of the system projects are typically removed from our advancedstage project pipeline tables below once we substantially complete construction of the project and after substantially all of the associated project revenue is recognized a project or a portion of a project may also be removed from the tables below in the event the project is not able to be sold due to the changing economics of the project or other factors or we decide to temporarily own and operate the project based on strategic opportunities or market factors

results of operations 

the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 



segment overview 

we operate our business in two segments our modules segment involves the design manufacture and sale of cdte solar modules to third parties and our systems segment includes the development construction contracting and management operation maintenance and sale of pv solar power systems including any modules installed in such systems and any revenue from energy generated by such systems 

net sales 

modules business 

we generally price and sell our solar modules on a per watt basis during 2020 longroad energy  nextera energy and softbank each accounted for more than 10 of our modules business net sales and the majority of our solar modules were sold to integrators and operators of systems in the united states and france substantially all of our modules business net sales during 2020 were denominated in us dollars and euro we recognize revenue for module sales at a point in time following the transfer of control of the modules to the customer which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery depending on the terms of the underlying contracts the revenue recognition 

policies for module sales are further described in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements 

systems business 

during 2020 goldman sachs renewable power smfl mirai partners and mitsui  co each accounted for more than 10 of our systems business net sales and the majority of our systems business net sales were in the united states and japan substantially all of our systems business net sales during 2020 were denominated in us dollars and japanese yen we recognize revenue for sales of solar power systems using cost based input methods which result in revenue being recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred compared to the total estimated costs for a given contract we may also recognize revenue for the sale of a development project which excludes epc services or for the sale of a completed system when we enter into the associated sales contract with the customer the revenue recognition policies for our systems business are further described in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements 

the following table shows net sales by reportable segment for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 



net sales from our modules segment increased by 2759 million in 2020 primarily due to a 21 increase in the volume of watts sold partially offset by a 2 decrease in the average selling price per watt net sales from our systems segment decreased by 6277 million in 2020 primarily due to the completion of substantially all construction activities at the sun streams phoebe sunshine valley rosamond seabrook and lake hancock projects in 2019 the sale of the beryl and little bear projects in 2019 and lower construction activities at the ga solar 4 project in the current period partially offset by the sale of the ishikawa american kings miyagi anamizu tungabhadra and anantapur projects in 2020 

cost of sales 

modules business 

our modules business cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials and components for manufacturing solar modules such as glass transparent conductive coatings cdte and other thin film semiconductors laminate materials connector assemblies edge seal materials and frames in addition our cost of sales includes direct labor for the manufacturing of solar modules and manufacturing overhead such as engineering equipment maintenance quality and production control and information technology our cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing plant and equipment facilityrelated expenses environmental health and safety costs and costs associated with shipping warranties and solar module collection and recycling excluding accretion 

systems business 

for our systems business projectrelated costs include development costs legal consulting transmission upgrade interconnection permitting and other similar costs epc costs consisting primarily of solar modules inverters electrical and mounting hardware project management and engineering and construction labor and site specific costs 

the following table shows cost of sales by reportable segment for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 



cost of sales decreased 4832 million or 19 and decreased 72 percentage points as a percent of net sales when comparing 2020 with 2019 the decrease in cost of sales was driven by a 6201 million decrease in our systems segment cost of sales primarily due to the lower volume of projects under construction during the period such decrease in our systems segment cost of sales was partially offset by a 1369 million increase in our modules segment cost of sales primarily as a result of the following 

• higher costs of 2474 million from an increase in the volume of modules sold 

• an impairment loss of 174 million for certain module manufacturing equipment including framing and assembly tools which were no longer compatible with our longterm module technology roadmap 

• manufacturing related charges of 151 million associated with the ongoing covid19 pandemic and 

• a reduction to our product warranty liability of 800 million in 2019 due to revised module return rates partially offset by 

• a reduction to our product warranty liability of 197 million in 2020 due to lowerthanexpected settlements for our older series of module technology and revisions to projected settlements 

• lower underutilization and certain other charges associated with the initial ramp of certain series 6 manufacturing lines which decreased cost of sales by 617 million compared to 2019 

• a reduction in our module collection and recycling liability of 189 million primarily due to changes to the estimated timing of cash flows associated with capital labor and maintenance costs and updates to certain valuation assumptions and 

• continued module cost reductions which decreased cost of sales by 1572 million 

gross profit 

gross profit may be affected by numerous factors including the selling prices of our modules and systems our manufacturing costs project development costs bos costs the capacity utilization of our manufacturing facilities and foreign exchange rates gross profit may also be affected by the mix of net sales from our modules and systems businesses 

the following table shows gross profit for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 



gross profit increased 72 percentage points to 251 during 2020 from 179 during 2019 primarily due to higher gross profit on thirdparty module sales and improved throughput of our manufacturing facilities from the successful ramp of various series 6 manufacturing lines partially offset by the lower benefit from reductions to our product warranty liability and the impairment loss for certain module manufacturing equipment described above 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated costs professional fees insurance costs and other business development and selling expenses 

the following table shows selling general and administrative expense for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 



selling general and administrative expense in 2020 increased compared to 2019 primarily due to higher charges for impairments of certain project assets and an increase in professional fees partially offset by lower project development and travel expenses 

research and development 

research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated costs the cost of products materials and outside services used in our rd activities and depreciation and amortization expense associated with rd specific facilities and equipment we maintain a number of programs and activities to improve our technology and processes in order to enhance the performance and reduce the costs of our solar modules 

the following table shows research and development expense for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 



research and development expense in 2020 decreased compared to 2019 primarily as a result of lower employee compensation expense due to reductions in rd headcount for our systems business partially offset by increased material and module testing costs 

production startup 

production startup expense consists primarily of employee compensation and other costs associated with operating a production line before it is qualified for full production including the cost of raw materials for solar modules run through the production line during the qualification phase and applicable facility related costs costs related to equipment upgrades and implementation of manufacturing process improvements are also included in production startup expense as well as costs related to the selection of a new site related legal and regulatory costs and costs to maintain our plant replication program to the extent we cannot capitalize these expenditures in general we expect production startup expense per production line to be higher when we build an entirely new manufacturing facility compared with the addition or replacement of production lines at an existing manufacturing facility primarily due to the additional infrastructure investment required when building an entirely new facility 

the following table shows production startup expense for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 



during 2020 we incurred production startup expense for the transition to series 6 module manufacturing at our second facility in kulim malaysia and the capacity expansion of our manufacturing facility in perrysburg ohio during 2019 we incurred production startup expense at our new facility in lake township ohio and our second facility in ho chi minh city vietnam which commenced commercial production in early 2019 

litigation loss 

the following table shows litigation loss for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 



in january 2020 we entered into an mou to settle a class action lawsuit filed in 2012 in the arizona district court against the company and certain of our current and former officers and directors pursuant to the mou we agreed to pay a total of 350 million to settle the claims brought on behalf of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired the company’s shares during a specified period in exchange for mutual releases and a dismissal with prejudice of the complaint upon court approval of the settlement the settlement contains no admission of liability wrongdoing or responsibility by any of the parties as a result of the entry into the mou we accrued a loss for the abovereferenced settlement in 2019 and paid the 350 million settlement in january 2020 in june 2020 the arizona district court entered an order that granted final approval of the settlement and dismissed the class action with prejudice 

in june 2020 we entered into an agreement in principle to settle the claims in the optout action filed in 2015 in the arizona district court by putative stockholders that opted out of the class action in july 2020 the parties executed a definitive settlement agreement pursuant to which we agreed to pay a total of 19 million in exchange for mutual releases and a dismissal with prejudice of the optout action the agreement contains no admission of liability wrongdoing or responsibility by any of the parties in july 2020 first solar funded the settlement and the parties filed a joint stipulation of dismissal in september 2020 the arizona district court entered an order dismissing the case with prejudice as of december 31 2019 we had accrued 13 million of estimated losses for this action as a result of the settlement we accrued an incremental 6 million litigation loss during 2020 

see note 13 “commitments and contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on these matters 

foreign currency loss income net 

foreign currency loss income net consists of the net effect of gains and losses resulting from holding assets and liabilities and conducting transactions denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries’ functional currencies 

the following table shows foreign currency loss income net for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 



foreign currency loss increased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to higher costs associated with hedging activities related to our subsidiaries in japan and europe and differences between our economic hedge positions and the underlying exposures 

interest income 

interest income is earned on our cash cash equivalents marketable securities restricted cash and restricted marketable securities interest income also includes interest earned from notes receivable and late customer payments 

the following table shows interest income for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 



interest income during 2020 decreased compared to 2019 primarily due to lower interest rates on cash and cash equivalents and lower average balances and interest rates associated with time deposits and marketable securities 

interest expense net 

interest expense net is primarily comprised of interest incurred on longterm debt settlements of interest rate swap contracts and changes in the fair value of interest rate swap contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 815 we may capitalize interest expense to our project assets or property plant and equipment when such costs qualify for interest capitalization which reduces the amount of net interest expense reported in any given period 

the following table shows interest expense net for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 



interest expense net in 2020 decreased compared to 2019 primarily due to lower interest expense associated with project debt partially offset by higher amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs and a decrease in capitalized interest 

other expense income net 

other expense income net is primarily comprised of miscellaneous items and realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities and restricted marketable securities 

the following table shows other expense income net for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 



other expense net increased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to lower realized gains from sales of restricted marketable securities and expected credit losses associated with certain notes receivable partially offset by prior period charges associated with certain letter of credit arrangements and the impairment of a strategic investment see note 7 “consolidated balance sheet details” to our consolidated financial statements for further information about the allowance for credit losses for our notes receivable 

income tax benefit expense 

income tax expense or benefit deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect our best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which we operate principally japan malaysia and vietnam significant judgments and estimates are required to determine our consolidated income tax expense the statutory federal corporate income tax rate in the united states is 21 and the tax rates in japan malaysia and vietnam are 306 24 and 20 respectively in malaysia we have been granted a longterm tax holiday scheduled to expire in 2027 pursuant to which substantially all of our income earned in malaysia is exempt from income tax conditional upon our continued compliance with certain employment and investment thresholds in vietnam we have been granted a tax incentive scheduled to expire at the end of 2025 pursuant to which income earned in vietnam is subject to reduced tax rates 

the following table shows income tax benefit expense for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 



our tax rate is affected by recurring items such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions the rate is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from period to period income tax benefit increased by 1018 million during 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to a tax benefit from the effect of tax law changes associated with the cares act the reversal of uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of the statute of limitations and the release of the valuation allowance associated with our vietnamese subsidiary due to its current year operating income partially offset by higher pretax income 

equity in earnings net of tax 

equity in earnings net of tax represents our proportionate share of the earnings or losses from equity method investments as well as any gains or losses on the sale or disposal of such investments 

the following table shows equity in earnings net of tax for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 



equity in earnings net of tax in 2020 was consistent with equity in earnings net of tax in 2019 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2020 we believe that our cash cash equivalents marketable securities cash flows from operating activities contracts with customers for the future sale of solar modules and advancedstage project pipeline will be sufficient to meet our working capital capital expenditure and systems project investment needs for at least the next 12 months as needed we also believe we will have adequate access to the capital markets in addition we have availability under our revolving credit facility under which we have made no borrowings as of december 31 2020 we monitor our working capital to ensure we have adequate liquidity both domestically and internationally 

we intend to maintain appropriate debt levels based upon cash flow expectations our overall cost of capital and expected cash requirements for operations such as systems project development activities in certain international regions however our ability to raise capital on terms commercially acceptable to us could be constrained if there is insufficient lender or investor interest due to companyspecific industrywide or broader market concerns such as a tightening of the supply of capital due to the covid19 pandemic and related containment measures any incremental debt financings could result in increased debt service expenses andor restrictive covenants which could limit our ability to pursue our strategic plans 

as of december 31 2020 we had 17 billion in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities compared to 22 billion as of december 31 2019 the decrease in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities was primarily driven by purchases of property plant and equipment the 350 million settlement payment associated with our prior class action lawsuit the timing of cash receipts from certain thirdparty module sales for which proceeds were received in late 2019 prior to the step down in the us investment tax credit from 30 to 26 and other operating expenditures partially offset by cash proceeds from the sale and construction of certain systems projects as of december 31 2020 and 2019 11 billion and 09 billion respectively of our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries and was primarily based in us dollar japanese yen and indian rupee denominated holdings 

we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed if certain international funds were needed for our operations in the united states we may be required to accrue and pay certain us and foreign taxes to repatriate such funds we maintain the intent and ability to permanently reinvest our accumulated earnings outside the united states with the exception of our subsidiaries in canada and germany in addition changes to foreign government banking regulations may restrict our ability to move funds among various jurisdictions under certain circumstances which could negatively impact our access to capital resulting in an adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources 

we continually evaluate forecasted global demand and seek to balance our manufacturing capacity with such demand we continue to increase the nameplate production capacity of our existing manufacturing facilities by improving our production throughput increasing module wattage or conversion efficiency and improving manufacturing yield losses during 2021 we expect to spend 425 million to 475 million for capital expenditures including upgrades to machinery and equipment that we believe will further increase our module wattage and expand capacity and throughput at our manufacturing facilities 

we also expect to commit significant working capital to purchase various raw materials used in our module manufacturing process our failure to obtain raw materials and components that meet our quality quantity and cost requirements in a timely manner could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture our solar modules or increase our manufacturing costs accordingly we may enter into longterm supply agreements to mitigate potential risks related to the procurement of key raw materials and components and such agreements may be noncancelable or cancelable with a significant penalty for example we have entered into longterm supply agreements for the purchase of certain specified minimum volumes of substrate glass and cover glass for our pv solar modules our remaining purchases under these supply agreements are expected to be approximately 18 billion of substrate glass and 410 million of cover glass we have the right to terminate these agreements upon payment of specified 

termination penalties which in aggregate are up to 390 million as of december 31 2020 and decline over the remaining supply periods 

our systems business is expected to continue to have significant liquidity requirements in the future from time to time we enter into commercial commitments in the form of letters of credit bank guarantees and surety bonds to provide financial and performance assurance to third parties the majority of which support our systems projects our revolving credit facility provides us with a sublimit of 4000 million to issue letters of credit subject to certain additional limits depending on the currencies of such letters of credit the net amount of our project assets and related portions of deferred revenue and longterm debt which approximates our net capital investment in the development and construction of systems projects was 2606 million as of december 31 2020 solar power project development cycles which span the time between the identification of a site location and the commercial operation of a system vary substantially and can take many years to mature as a result of these long project cycles and strategic decisions to finance the development of certain projects using our working capital we may need to make significant upfront investments of resources in advance of the receipt of any cash from the sale of such projects delays in construction or in completing the sale of our systems projects that we are selffinancing may also impact our liquidity in certain circumstances we may need to finance construction costs exclusively using working capital if project financing becomes unavailable due to marketwide regional or other concerns 

from time to time we may develop projects in certain markets around the world where we may hold all or a significant portion of the equity in a project for several years given the duration of these investments and the currency risk relative to the us dollar in some of these markets we continue to explore local financing alternatives should these financing alternatives be unavailable or too cost prohibitive we could be exposed to significant currency risk and our liquidity could be adversely impacted 

additionally we may elect to retain an ownership interest in certain systems projects after they become operational if we determine it would be of economic and strategic benefit to do so if for example we cannot sell a system at economics that are attractive to us or potential customers are unwilling to assume the risks and rewards typical of system ownership we may instead elect to temporarily own and operate such system until we can sell it on economically attractive terms the decision to retain ownership of a system impacts our liquidity depending upon the size and cost of the project as of december 31 2020 we had 2434 million of net pv solar power systems that had been placed in service primarily in international markets we have elected and may in the future elect to enter into temporary or longterm project financing to reduce the impact on our liquidity and working capital with regard to such systems 

from time to time we may be party to legal matters and claims against us in january 2020 we entered into an mou to settle a class action lawsuit filed in the arizona district court pursuant to the mou among other things we agreed to pay a total of 350 million to settle the claims in the lawsuit in exchange for mutual releases and dismissal with prejudice of the complaint upon court approval of the settlement in february 2020 we subsequently entered into a stipulation and agreement of settlement the “settlement agreement” with certain named plaintiffs on terms and conditions that were consistent with the mou pursuant to the settlement agreement among other things i we contributed 350 million in cash to a settlement fund that will be used to pay all settlement fees and expenses attorneys’ fees and expenses and cash payments to members of the settlement class and ii the settlement class has agreed to release us the other defendants named in the class action and certain of their respective related parties from any and all claims concerning based on arising out of or in connection with the class action the settlement agreement contained no admission of liability wrongdoing or responsibility by any of the parties on june 30 2020 the arizona district court entered an order granting final approval of the settlement and dismissed the class action with prejudice 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes key cash flow activity for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 in thousands 



operating activities 

the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities during 2020 was primarily driven by the 350 million settlement payment associated with our prior class action lawsuit as described above and the timing of cash receipts from certain thirdparty module sales for which proceeds were received in late 2019 prior to the step down in the us investment tax credit partially offset by higher cash proceeds from the sale of systems projects in japan and the united states 

investing activities 

the decrease in net cash used in investing activities during 2020 was primarily due to lower purchases of property plant and equipment 

financing activities 

the increase in net cash used in financing activities during 2020 was primarily due to the repayment of the ishikawa credit agreement partially offset by proceeds from borrowings under project specific debt financings associated with the construction of certain projects in japan 

contractual obligations 

the following table presents the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of december 31 2020 in thousands excluding certain obligations we expect to transfer to clairvest upon the closing of the sale of our north american om business and to omers upon the closing of the sale of our us project development business 



—————————— 

1 includes estimated cash interest to be paid over the remaining terms of the underlying debt interest payments are based on fixed and floating rates as of december 31 2020 

2 purchase obligations represent agreements to purchase goods or services including open purchase orders and contracts with fixed volume commitments that are noncancelable or cancelable with a significant penalty purchase obligations for our longterm supply agreements for the purchase of substrate glass and cover glass represent specified termination penalties which are up to 390 million in the aggregate under the agreements our remaining purchases under these supply agreements are expected to be approximately 18 billion of substrate glass and 410 million of cover glass 

3 in connection with business or project acquisitions we may agree to pay additional amounts to the selling parties upon achievement of certain milestones see note 13 “commitments and contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements for further information 

4 includes expected letter of credit fees and unused revolver fees 

we have excluded 54 million of unrecognized tax benefits from the amounts presented above as the timing of such obligations is uncertain 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2020 we had no offbalance sheet debt or similar obligations other than financial assurance related instruments and operating leases which are not classified as debt we do not guarantee any thirdparty debt see note 13 “commitments and contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements for further information about our financial assurance related instruments 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 3 “recent accounting pronouncements” to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of recent accounting pronouncements 

critical accounting estimates 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “us gaap” we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of reported assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment in the selection of the appropriate assumptions for making these estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty we base our judgments and estimates on our historical experience our forecasts and other available information as appropriate the actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results our future results of operations will be affected our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements the accounting policies that require the most significant judgment and estimates include the following 

revenue recognition – solar power system sales andor epc services  we recognize revenue for the sale of a development project which excludes epc services or for the sale of a completed system when we enter into the associated sales contract with the customer for epc services or sales of solar power systems with epc services we generally recognize revenue over time as our performance creates or enhances an energy generation asset controlled by the customer furthermore the sale of a solar power system combined with epc services represents a single performance obligation for the development and construction of a single generation asset for such arrangements we recognize revenue and gross profit as work is performed using cost based input methods for which we determine our progress toward contract completion based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs including solar module costs of the contract  such revenue recognition is also dependent in part on our customers’ commitment to perform their obligations under the contract which is typically measured through the receipt of cash deposits or other forms of financial security issued by creditworthy financial institutions or parent entities 

cost based input methods of revenue recognition are considered a faithful depiction of our efforts to satisfy longterm construction contracts and therefore reflect the transfer of goods to a customer under such contracts costs incurred that do not contribute to satisfying our performance obligations “inefficient costs” are excluded from our input methods of revenue recognition as the amounts are not reflective of our transferring control of the system to the customer costs incurred toward contract completion may include costs associated with solar modules direct materials labor subcontractors and other indirect costs related to contract performance we recognize solar module and direct material costs as incurred when such items have been installed in a system 

cost based input methods of revenue recognition require us to make estimates of net contract revenues and costs to complete our projects in making such estimates significant judgment is required to evaluate assumptions related to the amount of net contract revenues including the impact of any performance incentives liquidated damages and other payments to customers significant judgment is also required to evaluate assumptions related to the costs to complete our projects including materials labor contingencies and other system costs if the estimated total costs on any contract including any inefficient costs are greater than the net contract revenues we recognize the entire estimated loss in the period the loss becomes known the cumulative effect of revisions to estimates related to net contract revenues or costs to complete contracts are recorded in the period in which the revisions to estimates are identified and the amounts can be reasonably estimated the effect of the changes on future periods are recognized as if the revised estimates had been used since revenue was initially recognized under the contract such revisions could occur in any reporting period and the effects may be material depending on the size of the contracts or the changes in estimates 

as part of our solar power system sales we conduct performance testing of a system prior to substantial completion to confirm the system meets its operational and capacity expectations noted in the epc agreement in addition we may provide an energy performance test during the first or second year of a system’s operation to demonstrate that the actual energy generation for the applicable period meets or exceeds the modeled energy expectation after certain adjustments these tests are based on meteorological energy and equipment performance data measured at the system’s location as well as certain projections of such data over the remaining measurement period in certain instances a bonus payment may be received at the end of the applicable test period if the system performs above a specified level conversely if there is an underperformance event with regards to these tests we may incur liquidated damages as a percentage of the epc contract price such performance guarantees represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data becomes available and only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of any incremental revenue will not occur 

revenue recognition – operations and maintenance we recognize revenue for standard recurring om services over time as customers receive and consume the benefits of such services costs of om services are expensed in the period in which they are incurred as part of our om service offerings we typically offer an effective availability guarantee which stipulates that a system will be available to generate a certain percentage of total possible energy during a specific period after adjusting for factors outside our control as the service provider these tests are based on meteorological energy and equipment performance data measured at the system’s location as well as certain projections of such data over the remaining measurement period if system availability exceeds a contractual threshold we may receive a bonus payment or if system availability falls below a separate threshold we may incur liquidated damages for certain lost energy under the ppa such bonuses or liquidated damages represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated and recognized over time as customers receive and consume the benefits of the om services 

accrued solar module collection and recycling liability we previously established a module collection and recycling program which has since been discontinued to collect and recycle modules sold and covered under such program once the modules reach the end of their service lives for legacy customer sales contracts that were covered under this program we recognized expense at the time of sale for the estimated cost of our obligations to collect and recycle such modules we estimate the cost of our collection and recycling obligations based on the present value of the expected future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules which includes estimates for the cost of 

packaging materials the cost of freight from the solar module installation sites to a recycling center material labor and capital costs and byproduct credits for certain materials recovered during the recycling process we base these estimates on our experience collecting and recycling solar modules and certain assumptions regarding costs at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled in the periods between the time of sale and the related settlement of the collection and recycling obligation we accrete the carrying amount of the associated liability and classify the corresponding expense within “selling general and administrative” expense on our consolidated statements of operations we periodically review our estimates of expected future recycling costs and may adjust our liability accordingly 

product warranties we provide a limited pv solar module warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for up to 12 years we also typically warrant that modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 98 of their labeled power output rating during the first year with the warranty coverage reducing by a degradation factor every year thereafter throughout the limited power output warranty period of up to 30 years among other things our solar module warranty also covers the resulting power output loss from cell cracking 

as an alternative form of our standard limited module power output warranty we have also offered an aggregated or systemlevel limited module performance warranty this systemlevel limited module performance warranty is designed for utilityscale systems and provides 25year systemlevel energy degradation protection this warranty represents a practical expedient to address the challenge of identifying from the potential millions of modules installed in a utilityscale system individual modules that may be performing below warranty thresholds by focusing on the aggregate energy generated by the system rather than the power output of individual modules the systemlevel limited module performance warranty is typically calculated as a percentage of a system’s expected energy production adjusted for certain actual site conditions with the warranted level of performance declining each year in a linear fashion but never falling below 80 during the term of the warranty 

in addition to our limited solar module warranties described above for pv solar power systems we construct we typically provide limited warranties for defects in engineering design installation and bos part workmanship for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a system or a block within the system 

when we recognize revenue for module or system sales we accrue liabilities for the estimated future costs of meeting our limited warranty obligations we make and revise these estimates based primarily on the number of our solar modules under warranty installed at customer locations our historical experience with and projections of warranty claims and our estimated permodule replacement costs we also monitor our expected future module performance through certain quality and reliability testing and actual performance in certain field installation sites in general we expect the return rates for our newer series of module technology to be lower than our older series we estimate that the return rate for such newer series of module technology will be less than 1 

income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the united states its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations such tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant taxing authorities we make judgments and interpretations regarding the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining our provision for income taxes and also make estimates about when in the future certain items are expected to affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions disputes over interpretations of tax laws may be settled with the relevant taxing authority upon examination or audit we regularly evaluate the likelihood of assessments in each of our taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and future examinations and we record tax liabilities as appropriate 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements we calculate our income tax provision based on our interpretation of the tax laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business this requires us to estimate our current tax obligations assess uncertain tax positions and assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities we must also assess the likelihood that each of our deferred tax assets will be realized to 

the extent we believe that realization of any of our deferred tax assets is not more likely than not we establish a valuation allowance when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a reporting period we generally record a corresponding tax expense conversely to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed which generally reduces our overall income tax expense 

we establish liabilities for potential additional taxes based on our assessment of the outcome of our tax positions once established we adjust these liabilities when additional information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring an adjustment significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the actual cost of a tax assessment fine or penalty may ultimately be materially different from our recorded liabilities if any 

we continually explore initiatives to better align our tax and legal entity structure with the footprint of our global operations and recognize the tax impact of these initiatives including changes in the assessment of uncertain tax positions indefinite reinvestment exception assertions and the realizability of deferred tax assets in the period when we believe all necessary internal and external approvals associated with such initiatives have been obtained or when the initiatives are materially complete 

asset impairments we assess longlived assets classified as “held and used” including our property plant and equipment pv solar power systems project assets operating lease assets and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances arise including consideration of technological obsolescence that may indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable and these assessments require significant judgment in determining whether such events or changes have occurred these events or changes in circumstances may include a significant decrease in the market price of a longlived asset a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset is being used or in its physical condition a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of a longlived asset an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a longlived asset a currentperiod operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of such losses or a projection of future losses associated with the use of a longlived asset or a current expectation that more likely than not a longlived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss longlived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and we must also exercise judgment in assessing such groupings and levels 

when impairment indicators are present we compare undiscounted future cash flows including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value to the asset group’s carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset group to its carrying value fair value is generally determined by considering i internally developed discounted cash flows for the asset group ii thirdparty valuations andor iii information available regarding the current market value for such assets if the fair value of an asset group is determined to be less than its carrying value an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and such projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency exchange risk 

cash flow exposure we expect certain of our subsidiaries to have future cash flows that will be denominated in currencies other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies changes in the exchange rates between the functional currencies of our subsidiaries and the other currencies in which they transact will cause fluctuations in the cash flows we expect to receive or pay when these cash flows are realized or settled accordingly we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of these forecasted cash flows these foreign exchange forward 

contracts qualify for accounting as cash flow hedges in accordance with asc 815 and we designated them as such we initially report unrealized gains or losses for such contracts in “accumulated other comprehensive loss” and subsequently reclassify amounts into earnings when the hedged transaction occurs and impacts earnings for additional details on our derivative hedging instruments and activities see note 8 “derivative financial instruments” to our consolidated financial statements 

certain of our international operations such as our manufacturing facilities in malaysia and vietnam pay a portion of their operating expenses including associate wages and utilities in local currencies which exposes us to foreign currency exchange risk for such expenses our manufacturing facilities are also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk for purchases of certain equipment from international vendors to the extent we expand into new markets particularly emerging markets our total foreign currency exchange risk in terms of both size and exchange rate volatility and the number of foreign currencies we are exposed to could increase significantly 

for the year ended december 31 2020 22 of our net sales were denominated in foreign currencies including japanese yen and euro as a result we have exposure to foreign currencies with respect to our net sales which has historically represented one of our primary foreign currency exchange risks a 10 change in the us dollar to japanese yen and euro exchange rates would have had an aggregate impact on our net sales of 538 million excluding the effect of our hedging activities 

transaction exposure many of our subsidiaries have assets and liabilities primarily cash receivables deferred taxes payables accrued expenses and solar module collection and recycling liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies changes in the exchange rates between the functional currencies of our subsidiaries and the other currencies in which these assets and liabilities are denominated will create fluctuations in our reported consolidated statements of operations and cash flows we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other financial instruments to economically hedge assets and liabilities against the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations the gains and losses on such foreign exchange forward contracts will economically offset all or part of the transaction gains and losses that we recognize in earnings on the related foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities for additional details on our economic hedging instruments and activities see note 8 “derivative financial instruments” to our consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2020 a 10 change in the us dollar relative to our primary foreign currency exposures would not have had a significant impact to our net foreign currency income or loss including the effect of our hedging activities 

interest rate risk 

variable rate debt exposure we are exposed to interest rate risk as certain of our project specific debt financings have variable interest rates exposing us to variability in interest expense and cash flows see note 12 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our longterm debt borrowing rates an increase in relevant interest rates would increase the cost of borrowing under certain of our project specific debt financings if such variable interest rates changed by 100 basis points our interest expense for the year ended december 31 2020 would have changed by 12 million including the effect of our hedging activities 

customer financing exposure we are also indirectly exposed to interest rate risk because many of our customers depend on debt financings to purchase modules or systems an increase in interest rates could make it challenging for our customers to obtain the capital necessary to make such purchases on favorable terms or at all such factors could reduce demand or lower the price we can charge for our modules and systems thereby reducing our net sales and gross profit in addition we believe that a significant percentage of our customers purchase systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt an increase in interest rates could lower an investor’s return on investment in a system or make alternative investments more attractive relative to pv solar power systems which in either case could cause these endusers to seek alternative investments with higher riskadjusted returns 

marketable securities and restricted marketable securities exposure we invest in various debt securities which exposes us to interest rate risk the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal and provide liquidity while at the same time maximizing the return on our investments many of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk accordingly a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the market value of such investments to fluctuate for example if we hold a security that was issued with an interest rate fixed at the thenprevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate subsequently rises the market value of our investment may decline 

for the year ended december 31 2020 our marketable securities earned a return of 2 including the impact of fluctuations in the price of the underlying securities and had a weightedaverage maturity of 8 months as of the end of the period based on our investment positions as of december 31 2020 a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would have resulted in a 08 million change in the market value of our investment portfolio for the year ended december 31 2020 our restricted marketable securities earned a return of 19 including the impact of fluctuations in the price of the underlying securities and had a weightedaverage maturity of approximately 15 years as of the end of the period based on our restricted marketable securities positions as of december 31 2020 a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would have resulted in a 402 million change in the market value of our restricted marketable securities portfolio 

commodity and component risk 

we are exposed to price risks for the raw materials components services and energy costs used in the manufacturing and transportation of our solar modules and bos parts used in our systems additionally some of our raw materials and components are sourced from a limited number of suppliers or a single supplier we evaluate our suppliers using a robust qualification process in some cases we also enter into longterm supply contracts for raw materials and components accordingly we are exposed to price changes in the raw materials and components used in our solar modules and systems from time to time we may utilize derivative hedging instruments to mitigate such raw material price changes in addition the failure of a key supplier could disrupt our supply chain which could result in higher prices andor a disruption in our manufacturing or construction processes we may be unable to pass along changes in the costs of the raw materials and components for our modules and systems to our customers and may be in default of our delivery obligations if we experience a manufacturing or construction disruption 

credit risk 

we have certain financial and derivative instruments that subject us to credit risk these consist primarily of cash cash equivalents marketable securities accounts receivable restricted cash and investments notes receivable foreign exchange forward contracts and commodity swap contracts we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial and derivative instruments we place cash cash equivalents marketable securities restricted cash restricted marketable securities foreign exchange forward contracts and commodity swap contracts with various highquality financial institutions and limit the amount of credit risk from any one counterparty we continuously evaluate the credit standing of our counterparty financial institutions we monitor the financial condition of our customers and perform credit evaluations whenever considered necessary depending upon the sales arrangement we may require some form of payment security from our customers including but not limited to advance payments parent guarantees standby letters of credit bank guarantees surety bonds or commercial letters of credit we also have ppas that subject us to credit risk in the event our offtake counterparties are unable to fulfill their contractual obligations which may adversely affect our project assets and certain receivables accordingly we closely monitor the credit standing of existing and potential offtake counterparties to limit such risks

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate “internal control over financial reporting” as defined in exchange act rule 13a15f and 15d15f we also carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2020 based on the criteria established in internal control – integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us gaap based on such evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2020 the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2020 has also been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in its report which appears herein 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

we also carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of our “internal control over financial reporting” to determine whether any changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2020 that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting based on that evaluation there were no such changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2020 

limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

control systems no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control systems’ objectives are being met further the design of any system of controls must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of all controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within our company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of error or mistake control systems can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

 item 1 business 

company overview 

we are a leading global provider of comprehensive pv solar energy solutions we design manufacture and sell pv solar modules with an advanced thin film semiconductor technology and also develop and sell pv solar power systems that primarily use the modules we manufacture additionally we provide operations and maintenance “om” services to system owners we have substantial ongoing rd efforts focused on various technology innovations we are the world’s largest thin film pv solar module manufacturer and one of the world’s largest pv solar module manufacturers 

in addressing the overall global demand for electricity our highefficiency cdte modules which leverage our series 6 tm “series 6” module technology and power plant solutions compete favorably on an economic basis with traditional forms of energy generation and provide low cost electricity to end users our diverse capabilities facilitate the sale of these solutions and the adoption of our technology in key markets around the world we believe our strategies and points of differentiation provide the foundation for our leading industry position and enable us to remain one of the preferred providers of pv solar energy solutions 

business strategy 

differentiated technology 

as a fieldproven technology our cdte solar modules offer certain advantages over conventional crystalline silicon solar modules by delivering competitive efficiency higher realworld energy yield and longterm reliability proven to deliver up to 8 more usable energy per nameplate watt than monofacial crystalline silicon technologies in certain geographic markets and with a record of reliable system performance our cdte technology delivers more energy more consistently over the lifetime of a pv solar power system our series 6 module technology with its combination of high wattage low manufacturing costs a larger form factor and balance of systems “bos” component compatibility has further enhanced our competitive position since the launch of such technology in 2018 

in terms of energy yield in many climates our cdte solar modules provide an energy production advantage over most monofacial crystalline silicon solar modules of equivalent efficiency rating for example our cdte solar modules provide a superior temperature coefficient which results in stronger system performance in typical high insolation climates as the majority of a system’s generation on average occurs when module temperatures are well above 25°c standard test conditions in addition our cdte solar modules provide a superior spectral response in humid environments where atmospheric moisture alters the solar spectrum relative to laboratory standards our cdte solar modules also provide a better shading response than conventional crystalline silicon solar modules which may lose up to three times as much power as cdte solar modules when shading occurs as a result of these and other factors our pv solar modules typically produce more annual energy in real world field conditions than conventional modules with the same nameplate capacity 

manufacturing process 

our modules are manufactured in a highthroughput automated environment that integrates all manufacturing steps into a continuous flow line such manufacturing process eliminates the multiple supply chain operators and timeconsuming and resourceintensive batch processing steps that are used to produce crystalline silicon solar modules at the outset of the production of our modules a sheet of glass enters the production line and in a matter of hours is transformed into a completed module which is flash tested packaged and ready for shipment with more than 25 gw dc of modules sold worldwide we have a demonstrated history of manufacturing success and innovation we have a global manufacturing footprint with facilities based in the united states malaysia and vietnam 

diversified capabilities 

we are diversified across the solar value chain many of the efficiencies and capabilities that we deliver to our customers are not easily replicable for other industry participants that are not diversified in a similar manner accordingly our operational model offers pv solar energy solutions that benefit from our wide range of capabilities including advanced pv solar module manufacturing project development engineering and plant optimization grid integration and plant control systems construction services and om services 

financial viability 

we are committed to creating longterm shareholder value through a decisionmaking framework that delivers a balance of growth profitability and liquidity this framework has enabled us to fund our series 6 manufacturing and capacity expansion initiatives using cash flows generated by our operations despite substantial downward pressure on the price of solar modules and systems due to competition demand fluctuations and significant overcapacity in the industry our financial viability provides strategic optionality as we evaluate how to invest in our business and generate returns for our shareholders our financial viability and bankability also enable us to offer meaningful warranties which provide us with a competitive advantage relative to many of our peers in the solar industry in the context of project financing and offering pv solar energy solutions to longterm owners furthermore we expect our financial discipline and ability to manage operating costs to enhance our profitability as we continue to scale our business 

sustainability 

in addition to our financial commitments we are also committed to minimizing the environmental impacts and enhancing the social and economic benefits of our products across their life cycle from raw material sourcing through endoflife module recycling accordingly our modules and systems provide an ecologically leading solution to climate change energy security and water scarcity which also enables our customers to achieve their sustainability objectives on a lifecycle basis our thin film module technology has the fastest energy payback time smallest carbon footprint and lowest water use of any pv solar technology on the market 

the energy payback time which is the amount of time a system must operate to recover the energy required to produce it of our module technology is facilitated by our specialized manufacturing process in less than six months under high irradiance conditions our systems produce more energy than was required to create them this energy payback time represents a 50fold energy return on investment over a theoretical 25year system lifetime and an abundant net energy gain to the electricity grid our module technology also has a carbon footprint that is up to six times lower than the carbon footprint of conventional crystalline silicon modules and a fraction of the carbon footprint of conventional energy sources furthermore our module technology displaces up to 98 of greenhouse gas emissions and other air pollutants when replacing traditional forms of energy generation our modules also use up to 400 times less water per mw hour than conventional energy sources and up to 24 times less water than other pv solar modules in addition our industryleading recycling process further enhances our sustainability advantage by recovering approximately 90 of the glass for reuse in new glass products and over 90 of the semiconductor material for reuse in new modules 

offerings and capabilities 

we are focusing on markets and energy applications in which solar power can be a leastcost bestfit energy solution particularly in regions with high solar resources significant current or projected electricity demand andor relatively high existing electricity prices we differentiate our product offerings by geographic market and localize the solution as needed our consultative approach to our customers’ solar energy needs and capabilities results in customized solutions to meet their economic goals as a result we have designed our product and service offerings according to the following business areas 

 

 

 

following an evaluation of the longterm sustainable cost structure competitiveness and riskadjusted returns of our us project development business we have determined it is in the best interest of our stockholders to explore options for this business line this exploration may result in among other possibilities a partnership with a third party who possesses complimentary competencies or a sale of all or a portion of our us project development business this exploration of options for our us project development business is not subject to any definitive timetable and there can be no assurances that this process will result in any transaction 

market overview 

solar energy is one of the fastest growing forms of renewable energy with numerous economic and environmental benefits that make it an attractive complement to andor substitute for traditional forms of energy generation in recent years the price of pv solar power systems and accordingly the cost of producing electricity from such systems has dropped to levels that are competitive with or below the wholesale price of electricity in many markets this rapid price decline has opened new possibilities to develop systems in many locations with limited or no financial incentives other technological developments in the industry such as the advancement of energy storage capabilities have further enhanced the prospects of solar energy as an alternative to traditional forms of energy generation furthermore the fact that a pv solar power system requires no fuel provides a unique and valuable hedging benefit to owners of such systems relative to traditional energy generation assets once installed pv solar power systems can function for over 35 years 

with relatively less maintenance or oversight compared to many other forms of generation in addition to these economic benefits solar energy has substantial environmental benefits for example pv solar power systems generate no greenhouse gas or other emissions and use minimal amounts of water compared to traditional energy generation assets worldwide solar markets continue to develop aided by the above factors as well as demand elasticity resulting from declining industry average selling prices both at the module and system level which have made solar power one of the most economically attractive sources of energy 

module average selling prices in many global markets have declined in recent years and are expected to continue to decline to some degree in the future in the aggregate we believe manufacturers of solar cells and modules have significant installed production capacity relative to global demand and the ability for additional capacity expansion we believe the solar industry may from time to time experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity exceeds global demand and that such periods will continue to put pressure on pricing additionally intense competition at the system level may result in an environment in which pricing falls rapidly thereby further increasing demand for solar energy solutions but constraining the ability for project developers and diversified module manufacturers to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability in light of such market realities we are focusing on our strategies and points of differentiation which include our advanced module technology our manufacturing process our diversified capabilities our financial viability and the sustainability advantage of our modules and systems 

global markets 

we have established and continue to develop a global business presence energy markets are by their nature localized with different drivers and market forces impacting electricity generation and demand in a particular region or for a particular application accordingly our business is evolving worldwide and is shaped by the varying ways in which our offerings can be compelling and economically viable solutions to energy needs in various markets the following represent the key markets for our modules and systems 

the americas 

united states multiple markets within the united states which accounted for 87 of our 2019 net sales exemplify favorable characteristics for a solar market including i sizeable electricity demand particularly around growing population centers and industrial areas ii strong demand for renewable energy generation and iii abundant solar resources in those areas and applications in which these factors are more pronounced our pv solar energy solutions compete favorably on an economic basis with traditional forms of energy generation the market penetration of pv solar is also impacted by certain federal and state support programs including the federal investment tax credit as described below under “support programs” we have significant experience and a market leadership position in developing and operating utilityscale power plants in the united states particularly in california other western states and southeastern states currently our solar projects in the united states represent the majority of the advancedstage pipeline of projects that we are actively developing or constructing see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – systems project pipeline” for more information about these projects 

other americas outside the united states we have drawn on our industry expertise and module technology advantages to make inroads in certain central and south american markets accordingly we continue to pursue module sale opportunities in mexico and brazil while monitoring opportunities in other countries with high growth potential 

asiapacific 

australia australia is a promising region for pv solar energy with continued growth expected over the next several years much of this growth is being driven by several factors including an increased demand for ppas from australian commercial and industrial companies certain government programs and continued procurement from local utilities as well as the emergence of a merchant power market we continue to focus our efforts in the region on utilityscale project development including our selfdeveloped projects in queensland new south wales and victoria while increasing our om services and thirdparty module sales in june 2019 we completed the sale of our 87 mw ac beryl project located in new south wales 

japan japan’s electricity markets have various characteristics which make them attractive markets for pv solar energy in particular japan has few domestic fossil fuel resources and relies heavily on fossil fuel imports following the fukushima earthquake in 2011 the country introduced certain initiatives to limit its reliance on nuclear power accordingly the japanese government announced a longterm goal of dramatically increasing installed solar power capacity and provided various incentives for solar power installations in recent years we have partnered with local companies to develop construct and operate various pv solar power systems which are expected to mitigate japan’s dependence on fossil fuel imports and nuclear power in 2019 we commenced construction of a 38 mw ac project in kyoto prefecture a 17 mw ac project in ishikawa prefecture and an 11 mw ac project in ibaraki prefecture we continue to operate the 59 mw ac ishikawa project and provide om services to certain other projects we previously sold in 2018 we continue to pursue other utilityscale project development om and module sale opportunities in the region 

europe the middle east and india 

europe  most markets across europe reflect strong demand for pv solar energy due to its ability to compete economically with more traditional forms of energy generation in particular france germany greece italy the netherlands portugal and spain are all running tenders in which utilityscale pv solar projects can bid for capacity such tenders and other recent market developments indicate the potential for further growth in the demand for pv solar energy beyond the region’s installed generation capacity of approximately 135 gw dc  we continue to pursue module sales activities in many of the countries mentioned above 

the middle east the market potential for solar energy in the middle east continues to be driven by a combination of strong economic fundamentals aggressive tariff pricing abundant solar resources and robust policy egypt jordan oman qatar saudi arabia and the united arab emirates the “uae” have established utilityscale solar programs which are at varying degrees of maturity jordan and the uae lead the region with policy mechanisms designed to ramp up the amount of renewable energy in their generation portfolios while there are various motives for investing in solar energy including energy security diversification of generation portfolios and the minimization of domestic consumption of hydrocarbons the common factor is that the economics of pv solar energy have made it a compelling energy generation source we have sold approximately 400 mw dc of modules in the region and continue to pursue additional module sales opportunities 

india india continues to represent one of the largest and fastest growing markets for pv solar energy with an installed generation capacity of over 35 gw dc  another 12 gw dc of projects in development or construction and over 20 gw dc of new procurement programs announced in addition the government has established aggressive renewable energy targets which include increasing the country’s solar capacity to 100 gw ac by 2022 these targets along with various policy and regulatory measures help create significant and sustained demand for pv solar energy accordingly we expect to continue selling modules to local integrators and operators of systems to address the region’s energy needs we currently own and operate three projects with an aggregate capacity of 50 mw ac located in telangana and karnataka for which we have secured rights to sell power under separate 25year ppas to state owned electricity distribution 

companies in addition we continue to maintain our strong module presence in the region with approximately 2 gw dc of installed modules 

support programs 

although we compete in many markets that do not require solarspecific government subsidies or support programs our net sales and profits remain subject in the near term to variability based on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives such as quotas renewable portfolio standards and tendering systems in addition to these support programs financial incentives for pv solar energy generation may include tax and production incentives although we expect to become less impacted by and less dependent on these forms of government support over time such programs continue to influence the demand for pv solar energy around the world 

in europe renewable energy targets in conjunction with tenders for utilityscale pv solar and other support measures have contributed to growth in pv solar markets renewable energy targets prescribe how much energy consumption must come from renewable sources while incentive policies and competitive tender policies are intended to support new supply development by providing certainty to investors various european union “eu” directives on renewable energy have set targets for all eu member states in support of the current goal of a 32 share of energy from renewable sources in the eu by 2030  

tax incentive programs exist in the united states at both the federal and state level and can take the form of investment and production tax credits accelerated depreciation and sales and property tax exemptions and abatements at the federal level investment tax credits for business and residential solar systems have gone through several cycles of enactment and expiration since the 1980s in 2015 the us congress extended the 30 federal energy investment tax credit “itc” for both residential and commercial solar installations through 2019 among other requirements such credits require projects to have commenced construction by a certain date which may be achieved by certain qualifying procurement activities accordingly projects that commenced construction in 2019 were eligible for the 30 itc the credit will step down to 26 for projects that commence construction in 2020 22 for projects that commence construction in 2021 and 10 for projects that commence construction thereafter over the next several years we may advance the construction of various us systems projects or procure the associated modules or bos parts by specified dates for such projects to qualify for certain federal investment tax credits the itc has been an important economic driver of solar installations and qualifying procurement activities in the united states and its extension has contributed to greater mediumterm demand the positive impact of the itc depends to a large degree on the availability of tax equity for project financing and any significant reduction in the availability of tax equity in the future could make it more difficult to develop and construct projects requiring financing 

the majority of states in the united states have also enacted legislation adopting renewable portfolio standard “rps” mechanisms under an rps regulated utilities and other load serving entities are required to procure a specified percentage of their total retail electricity sales to enduser customers from eligible renewable resources such as solar energy generation facilities by a specified date some programs may further require that a specified portion of the total percentage of renewable energy must come from solar generation facilities or other technologies rps mechanisms and other legislation vary significantly from state to state particularly with respect to the percentage of renewable energy required to achieve the state’s rps the definition of eligible renewable energy resources and the extent to which renewable energy credits qualify for rps compliance 

measured in terms of the volume of renewable electricity required to meet its rps mandate california’s rps program is one of the most significant in the united states in addition to serving as a template for other states the california market for renewable energy has historically been a key region for first solar and has led the western united states in renewable energy demand for the past several years first enacted in 2002  california’s rps statute has been amended several times to increase the overall percentage requirement as well as to accelerate the target date for program compliance pursuant to the passage of sb100 by the california legislature in 2018 the california rps program now requires utilities and other obligated load serving entities to procure 60 of their total retail electricity demand from eligible renewable resources by 2030  

various proposed and contemplated environmental and tax policies may create regulatory uncertainty in the renewable energy sector including the solar energy sector and may lead to a reduction or removal of various clean energy programs and initiatives designed to curtail climate change for more information about the risks associated with these potential government actions see item 1a “risk factors – the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives tax incentives renewable energy targets and other support for ongrid solar electricity applications or other adverse public policies such as tariffs or other trade remedies imposed on solar cells and modules could negatively impact demand andor price levels for our solar modules and systems and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales thereby adversely impacting our operating results ” 

business segments 

we operate our business in two segments our modules segment involves the design manufacture and sale of cdte solar modules which convert sunlight into electricity thirdparty customers of our modules segment include integrators and operators of pv solar power systems our second segment is our systems segment through which we provide power plant solutions which include i project development ii engineering procurement and construction “epc” services and iii om services we may provide any combination of individual products and services within such capabilities including with respect to epc services by contracting with third parties depending upon the customer and market opportunity our systems segment customers include utilities independent power producers commercial and industrial companies and other system owners as part of our systems segment we may also temporarily own and operate certain of our systems for a period of time based on strategic opportunities or market factors see note 21 “segment and geographical information ” to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our business segments 

modules business 

solar modules 

since the inception of first solar our flagship module has used our advanced thin film semiconductor technology in april 2018 we commenced commercial production of our series 6 module technology which represents the latest generation of our flagship module each series 6 module is a glass laminate approximately 4ft x 6ft 123cm x 201cm in size that encapsulates thin film semiconductor materials at the end of 2019  our series 6 modules had an average power output of approximately 430 watts  our modules offer up to 8 more energy than monofacial crystalline silicon solar modules of equivalent nameplate capacity and generally include antireflective coated glass which further enhances energy production our module semiconductor structure is a singlejunction polycrystalline thin film that uses cdte as the absorption layer cdte has absorption properties that are well matched to the solar spectrum and can deliver competitive wattage using approximately 12 of the amount of semiconductor material used to manufacture conventional crystalline silicon modules due to its minimal thickness our thinfilm cdte semiconductor technology is also immune to cell cracking and its resulting power output loss a common failure often observed in crystalline silicon modules caused by adverse manufacturing handling weather or other conditions 

manufacturing process 

we manufacture our solar modules on integrated production lines in an automated proprietary and continuous process which includes the following three stages i the deposition stage ii the cell definition and treatment stage and iii the assembly and test stage in the deposition stage panels of transparent oxidecoated glass are robotically loaded onto the production line where they are cleaned lasermark identified with a serial number heated and coated with thin layers of cdte and other semiconductor materials using our proprietary vapor transport deposition technology after which the semiconductorcoated plates are cooled rapidly to increase glass strength in the cell definition and treatment stage we use highspeed lasers to transform the large continuous semiconductor coating on the glass plate into a series of interconnected cells that deliver the desired current and voltage output in this stage we also treat the semiconductor film using proprietary chemistries and processes to improve the device’s performance and we apply a metal sputtered back contact in the assembly and test stage we apply busbars interlayer material and a rear glass 

cover sheet that is laminated to encapsulate the device we then apply antireflective coating material to the substrate glass to further improve the module’s performance by increasing its ability to absorb sunlight finally junction boxes termination wires and an undermount frame for series 6 modules are applied to complete the assembly 

we maintain a robust quality and reliability assurance program that monitors critical process parameters and measures product performance to ensure that industry and more stringent internal standards are met we also conduct acceptance testing for electrical leakage visual quality and power measurement on a solar simulator prior to preparing a module for shipment the quality and reliability tests complement production surveillance with an ongoing monitoring program subjecting production modules to accelerated life stress testing to help ensure ongoing conformance to requirements of the international electrotechnical commission and underwriters laboratories inc these programs help assure delivery of power and performance in the field with a high level of product quality and reliability 

research and development 

our rd model differentiates us from much of our competition due to its vertical integration from advanced research to product development manufacturing and applications we continue to devote substantial resources to our rd efforts which generally focus on continually improving the wattage and energy yield of our solar modules we also focus our rd activities on continuously improving module durability and manufacturing efficiencies including throughput improvement volume ramp and material cost reduction based on publicly available information we are one of the leaders in rd investment among pv solar module manufacturers maintaining a rate of innovation that enables rapid wattage gains and cost reductions 

in the course of our rd activities we explore various technologies in our efforts to sustain competitive differentiation in our modules we primarily conduct our rd activities and qualify process and product improvements for full production at our perrysburg ohio plant and then use a systematic process to propagate them to our other production lines we believe that our systematic approach to technology change management provides continuous improvements and ensures uniform adoption across our production lines in addition our production lines are replicas or near replicas of each other and as a result a process or production improvement on one line can be rapidly and reliably deployed to other production lines 

we regularly produce research cells in our laboratories some of which are tested for performance and certified by independent labs such as the national renewable energy laboratory cell efficiency measures the proportion of light converted to electricity in a single solar cell at standard test conditions our research cells are produced using laboratory equipment and methods and are not intended to be representative of our manufacturing capability our module conversion efficiency has improved on average more than half a percent every year for the last ten years we currently hold two world records for cdte pv cell efficiency achieving an independently certified research cell efficiency of 221 and a full aperture area module efficiency of 186  we believe that our record cells demonstrate a potential longterm module efficiency entitlement of over 20 that is achievable using our commercialscale manufacturing equipment 

customers 

during 2019  we sold the majority of our solar modules not included in our systems projects to integrators and operators of systems in the united states and france  and such thirdparty module sales represented approximately 48 of our total net sales during 2019  cypress creek renewables  longroad energy  and nextera energy each accounted for more than 10 of our modules business net sales 

we continue to focus on key geographic markets particularly in areas with abundant solar resources and sizable electricity demand and additional customer relationships to diversify our customer base we also collaborate with providers of community solar solutions which address the residential and small business sectors to provide a broad range of customers with access to competitively priced solar energy regardless of the suitability of their rooftops community solar utilizes relatively small groundmounted installations that provide clean energy to utilities which 

then offer consumers the ability to buy into a specific community installation and benefit from the solar power generated by that resource the demand for such offerings continues to build as states across the country are enacting community solar policies and utilities are looking to diversify their energy generation portfolio in order to meet customer demand for affordable clean energy we also collaborate with providers of community choice aggregation programs which allow cities and counties to purchase power on behalf of residents and businesses to provide clean energy options at competitive prices our expertise in module technology and utilityscale generation paired with community solar andor community choice aggregation allows residential power consumers to “go solar” including those who live in apartment buildings or whose home rooftops cannot accommodate solar panels 

competition 

the solar energy and renewable energy sectors are highly competitive and continually evolving as participants in these sectors strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete within the larger electric power industry we face intense competition for sales of solar modules which has resulted in and may continue to result in reduced average selling prices and loss of market share with respect to our modules business our primary sources of competition are crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers in addition we expect to compete with future entrants into the pv solar industry and existing market participants that offer new or differentiated technological solutions for example many crystalline silicon cell and wafer manufacturers continue to transition from lower efficiency back surface field “bsf” multicrystalline cells the legacy technology against which we have generally competed in our markets to higher efficiency passivated emitter rear contact “perc” monocrystalline cells at competitive cost structures additionally while conventional solar modules including the solar modules we produce are monofacial meaning their ability to produce energy is a function of direct and diffuse irradiance on their front side certain manufacturers of monocrystalline perc modules are pursuing the commercialization of bifacial modules that also capture diffuse irradiance on the back side of a module we also face competition from semiconductor manufacturers and semiconductor equipment manufacturers or their customers that produce pv solar cells solar modules or turnkey production lines within the larger electric power industry we compete with companies that currently offer or are developing other renewable energy technologies including wind hydroelectric geothermal biomass and tidal technologies as well as traditional energy generation sources 

certain of our existing or future competitors may have direct or indirect access to sovereign capital which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time among pv solar module manufacturers the principal methods of competition include sales price per watt wattage or conversion efficiency energy yield reliability warranty terms and customer payment terms if competitors reduce module pricing to levels near or below their manufacturing costs or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time our results of operations could be adversely affected we believe the solar industry may from time to time experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity exceeds global demand and that such periods will put pressure on pricing which could adversely affect our results of operations for additional information see item 1a “risk factors – competition in solar markets globally and across the solar value chain is intense and could remain that way for an extended period of time an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may continue to cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations ” 

raw materials 

our cdte module manufacturing process uses approximately 30 types of raw materials and components to construct a solar module one critical raw material in our production process is cdte of the other raw materials and components the following are also critical to our manufacturing process front glass coated with transparent conductive oxide other semiconductor materials organics such as photo resist tempered back glass frames packaging components such as interlayer cord platecord plate cap lead wire and solar connectors before we use these materials and components in our manufacturing process a supplier must undergo rigorous qualification procedures and we continually evaluate new suppliers as part of our cost reduction roadmaps when possible we attempt to use suppliers that can provide a 

raw material supply source that is near our manufacturing locations reducing the cost and lead times for such materials several of our key raw materials and components are either singlesourced or sourced from a limited number of suppliers 

solar module collection and recycling 

we are committed to extended producer responsibility and take into account the environmental impact of our products over their entire life cycle as part of such efforts we previously established the solar industry’s first comprehensive module collection and recycling program our module recycling process is designed to maximize the recovery of materials including the glass and encapsulated semiconductor material for use in new modules or other products and enhances the sustainability profile of our modules approximately 90 of each collected first solar module can be recycled into materials for reuse for certain legacy customer sales contracts that were covered under this program we agreed to pay the costs for the collection and recycling of qualifying solar modules and the end users agreed to notify us disassemble their solar power systems package the solar modules for shipment and revert ownership rights over the modules back to us at the end of the modules’ service lives we currently have recycling facilities operating at each of our manufacturing facilities in the united states malaysia and vietnam and at our former manufacturing facility location in germany 

the eu’s waste electrical and electronic equipment “weee” directive places the obligation of recycling including collection treatment and environmentally sound disposal of electrical and electronic equipment products upon producers and is applicable to all pv solar modules in eu member states for modules covered under our program that were previously sold into and installed in the eu we continue to maintain a commitment to cover the estimated collection and recycling costs consistent with our historical program additionally as a result of the transposition of the weee directive by the eu member states we have adjusted our recycling offerings as required in various eu member states to ensure compliance with specific eu member state weee regulations 

solar module warranties 

we provide a limited pv solar module warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for approximately 10 years we also typically warrant that modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 98 of their labeled power output rating during the first year with the warranty coverage reducing by 05 every year thereafter throughout the approximate 25 year limited power output warranty period as an alternative form of our standard limited module power output warranty we also offer to certain customers an aggregated or systemlevel limited module performance warranty this systemlevel limited module performance warranty is designed for utilityscale systems and provides 25 year systemlevel energy degradation protection for additional information on our solar module warranty programs refer to item 1a “risk factors – problems with product quality or performance including our series 4 modules and series 6 modules may cause us to incur significant andor unexpected contractual damages andor warranty and related expenses damage our market reputation and prevent us from maintaining or increasing our market share ” 

systems business 

project development 

project development activities generally include i selecting securing and maintaining the project site ii obtaining the requisite interconnection and transmission studies iii executing an interconnection agreement iv obtaining environmental and landuse permits and v entering into a ppa with an offtaker for the power to be generated by the project the sequence of such development activities varies by international location and in certain locations may begin by initially bidding for ppa or offtake agreements these activities culminate in receiving the right to construct and operate a pv solar power system 

depending on the market opportunity or geographic location we may acquire projects in various stages of development or acquire project companies from developers in order to complete the development process construct a system 

incorporating our modules and sell the system to a longterm owner we may also collaborate with local partners in connection with these project development activities depending on the type of project or geographic location ppas or feedintariff “fit” structures define the price and terms the utility or customer will pay for power produced from the project depending primarily on the location stage of development upon our acquisition of the project andor other site attributes the development cycle typically ranges from one to two years but may be as long as five years we may be required to incur significant costs for preliminary engineering permitting legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built if there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals we may be forced to incur additional costs or impair our project assets and the termination rights of the offtaker under the ppa may be triggered 

following an evaluation of the longterm sustainable cost structure competitiveness and riskadjusted returns of our us project development business we have determined it is in the best interest of our stockholders to explore options for this business line this exploration may result in among other possibilities a partnership with a third party who possesses complimentary competencies or a sale of all or a portion of our us project development business this exploration of options for our us project development business is not subject to any definitive timetable and there can be no assurances that this process will result in any transaction 

epc services 

epc services generally include i engineering design and related services ii bos procurement iii advanced development of grid integration solutions and iv construction contracting and management depending on the customer and market need we may provide or subcontract with third parties to provide any combination of individual products and services within our capabilities we conduct performance testing of a system prior to substantial completion to confirm the system meets its operational and capacity expectations noted in the epc agreement for systems we construct we typically provide limited warranties for defects in engineering design installation and bos part workmanship for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a system or a block within the system we may also provide an energy performance test during the first or second year of a system’s operation to demonstrate that the actual energy generation for the applicable year meets or exceeds the modeled energy expectation after certain adjustments such as irradiance weather module degradation soiling curtailment and other conditions that may affect a system’s energy output but are unrelated to quality design or construction 

to further enhance the operational capabilities of utilityscale systems we may also provide energy storage solutions using advanced battery technology such storage solutions enable system owners to better align the delivery of energy with periods of peak demand thereby increasing a system’s overall value storage capabilities also allow pv solar plants to meet or exceed the peaking capabilities of fossil fuelbased plants at potentially lower costs our advanced plant control systems manage the operations of both the pv solar plant and its storage capabilities to ensure accurate delivery of requested power to the grid as part of our storage solutions we provide proprietary algorithms to design and simulate the optimal dispatch of a system depending on the customer and market needs including sitespecific weather conditions 

in september 2019 we announced our transition from an internal epc service model in the united states to an external model in which we expect to leverage the capabilities of thirdparty epc services in providing power plant solutions to our systems segment customers this transition is not expected to affect any projects currently under construction the shift to an external epc service model in the united states aligns with our typical model in international markets and is facilitated in part by our series 6 module technology and its improved bos compatibility 

om services 

our typical om service arrangements involve the performance of standard activities associated with operating and maintaining a pv solar power system we perform such activities pursuant to the scope of services outlined in the underlying contract these activities are considered necessary to optimize system performance and comply with ppas other agreements and regulations although the scope of our services varies by contract and jurisdiction our om 

service arrangements generally include 247 system monitoring certain ppa and other agreement compliance nerc compliance large generator interconnection agreement compliance energy forecasting performance engineering analysis regular performance reporting turnkey maintenance services including spare parts and corrective maintenance repair warranty management and environmental services as part of our om services we also typically provide an effective availability guarantee which stipulates that a system will be available to generate a certain percentage of total possible energy during a specific period after adjusting for factors outside our control as the service provider such as weather curtailment outages force majeure and other conditions that may affect system availability 

customers 

our systems customers consist of utilities independent power producers commercial and industrial companies and other system owners such as investors who are looking for longterm investment vehicles that are expected to generate consistent returns such customers may purchase completed systems which include our pv solar modules or any combination of development epc andor om services we also seek to provide innovative power plant solutions including grid integration and plant engineering services to facilitate the adoption and optimize the use of our technology during 2019  the substantial majority of our systems business sales were in the united states and australia  and the principal customers of our systems business were edp renewables  connectgen  and innergex renewable energy  who each accounted for more than 10 of our systems business net sales 

in certain markets the emergence of utilityowned generation has increased the number of potential project buyers as such utility customers benefit from a potentially low cost of capital available through ratebasing utility investments given their longterm ownership profile utilityowned generation customers typically seek to partner with diversified companies that can provide a broad spectrum of utilityscale generation solutions including reliable pv solar technology project development and construction and om services thereby mitigating their longterm ownership risks 

the wholesale commercial and industrial market also represents a promising opportunity given our utilityscale pv solar power system expertise the demand for corporate renewables continues to accelerate with corporations worldwide committing to the re100 campaign a collaborative global initiative of influential businesses committed to 100 renewable electricity we believe we also have a competitive advantage in the commercial and industrial market due to many customers’ sensitivity to the experience bankability and financial viability of their suppliers and geographically diverse operating locations with our strong development expertise financial strength and global footprint we are well positioned to meet these needs for example our 150 mw ac sun streams 2 project is expected to provide energy for certain microsoft corporation data centers and our recently sold 227 mw ac   muscle shoals 122 mw ac   cove mountain solar 2 and 58 mw ac   cove mountain solar 1 projects are expected to provide energy for certain facebook inc data centers through ppas with tennessee valley authority and pacificorp since our first corporate related ppa with apple inc we have contracted over 800 mw ac of ppas associated with corporate customers to support their renewable energy goals 

competition 

with respect to our systems business we face competition from other providers of renewable energy solutions including developers of pv solar power systems and developers of other forms of renewable energy projects such as wind hydroelectric geothermal biomass and tidal projects we may also compete with other developers that integrate energy storage solutions with pv solar or wind projects thereby enabling system owners to better align the delivery of energy with periods of peak demand to the extent other solar module manufacturers become more vertically integrated we expect to face increased competition from such companies as well certain current or potential future competitors may have a low cost of capital andor access to foreign capital the decline in module prices over the last several years has increased interest in solar energy worldwide and there are limited barriers to entry in certain parts of the pv solar value chain depending on the geographic market accordingly competition at the system level can be intense thereby exerting downward pressure on systemlevel selling prices industrywide see item 1a “risk factors – competition at the system level can be intense thereby potentially exerting downward pressure on systemlevel profit margins industrywide which could reduce our profitability and adversely affect our results of operations ” 

own and operate 

from time to time we may temporarily own and operate or retain interests in certain of our systems for a period of time based on strategic opportunities or market factors the ability to do so provides certain potential benefits including greater control over the sales process and offering a lower risk profile to project buyers as of december 31 2019  we owned and operated a number of systems in various geographic markets including chile india the united states and the asiapacific region as an owner and operator of certain systems in the united states we may be subject to the authority of the federal energy regulatory commission “ferc” as well as various other federal state and local regulatory bodies for more information about risks related to owning and operating such systems please see item 1a “risk factors – as an owner and operator of pv solar power systems that deliver electricity to the grid certain of our affiliated entities may be regulated as public utilities under us federal and state law which could adversely affect the cost of doing business and limit our growth ” for more information about the economics of such ownership and the impacts on our liquidity see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources” 

intellectual property 

our success depends in part on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technology and to conduct our business without infringing on the proprietary rights of others we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks and trade secrets as well as associate and thirdparty confidentiality agreements to safeguard our intellectual property we regularly file patent applications to protect inventions arising from our rd activities and are currently pursuing patent applications in the united states and other countries our patent applications and any future patent applications may not result in a patent being issued with the scope of the claims we seek or at all and any patents we may receive may be challenged invalidated or declared unenforceable in addition we have registered andor have applied to register trademarks and service marks in the united states and a number of foreign countries for “first solar” 

with respect to proprietary knowhow that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce we rely on among other things trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests we believe that many elements of our pv solar module manufacturing processes including our unique materials sourcing involve proprietary knowhow technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications including technical processes equipment designs algorithms and procedures we have taken security measures to protect these elements our rd personnel have entered into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us these agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our associates to assign to us all of the inventions designs and technologies they develop during the course of their employment with us we also require our customers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose sensitive aspects of our modules technology or business plans we have not been subject to any material intellectual property infringement or misappropriation claims 

environmental health and safety matters 

our operations include the use handling storage transportation generation and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes we are subject to various federal state local and international laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the use management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes occupational health and safety and the cleanup of contaminated sites therefore we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions and costs arising from thirdparty property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations or noncompliance with environmental permits required for our operations we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety requirements and do not expect to incur material expenditures for environmental and occupational health and safety controls in the foreseeable future however future developments such as the implementation of new more stringent laws and regulations more aggressive enforcement policies or the discovery of unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business 

financial condition or results of operations see item 1a “risk factors – environmental obligations and liabilities could have a substantial negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations ”

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the following information together with the other information in this annual report on form 10k before buying shares of our stock if any of the following risks or uncertainties occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our stock could decline 

risks related to our markets and customers 

competition in solar markets globally and across the solar value chain is intense and could remain that way for an extended period of time an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may continue to cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  

in the aggregate we believe manufacturers of solar cells and modules have significant installed production capacity relative to global demand and the ability for additional capacity expansion for example we estimate that in 2019 over 20 gw dc   of capacity was added by solar module manufacturers primarily but not exclusively in asia we believe the solar industry may from time to time experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity exceeds global demand and that such periods will continue to put pressure on pricing during the past several years industry average selling prices per watt have declined in many markets at times significantly both at the module and system levels as competitors have reduced prices to sell inventories worldwide there may be additional pressure on global demand and average selling prices in the future resulting from fluctuating demand in certain major solar markets such as china if our competitors reduce module pricing to levels near or below their manufacturing costs or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time or if demand for pv modules does not grow sufficiently to justify the current production supply our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

if pv solar and related technologies are not suitable for continued adoption at economically attractive rates of return or if sufficient additional demand for solar modules related technologies and systems does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate our net sales and profit may flatten or decline and we may be unable to sustain profitability 

in comparison to traditional forms of energy generation the solar energy market continues to be at a relatively early stage of development if utilityscale pv solar technology proves unsuitable for continued adoption at economically attractive rates of return or if additional demand for solar modules and systems fails to develop sufficiently or takes longer to develop than we anticipate we may be unable to grow our business or generate sufficient net sales to sustain profitability in addition demand for solar modules related technologies and systems in our targeted markets may develop to a lesser extent than we anticipate many factors may affect the viability of continued adoption of utilityscale pv solar technology in our targeted markets as well as the demand for solar modules and systems generally including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives tax incentives renewable energy targets and other support for ongrid solar electricity applications or other adverse public policies such as tariffs or other trade remedies imposed on solar cells and modules could negatively impact demand andor price levels for our solar modules and systems and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales thereby adversely impacting our operating results  

although we believe that solar energy will experience widespread adoption in those applications where it competes economically with traditional forms of energy without any support programs in certain markets our net sales and profits remain subject to variability based on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives federal state and local governmental bodies in many countries have provided subsidies in the form of fits rebates tax incentives and other incentives to end users distributors system integrators and manufacturers of pv solar products many of these support programs expire phase out over time require renewal by the applicable authority or may be amended a summary of certain recent developments in the major government support programs that may impact our business appears under item 1 “business – support programs” to the extent these support programs are reduced earlier than previously expected or are changed retroactively such changes could negatively impact demand andor price levels for our solar modules and systems lead to a reduction in our net sales and adversely impact our operating results another consideration in the us market and to a lesser extent in other global markets is the effect of governmental landuse planning policies and environmental policies on utilityscale pv solar development the adoption of restrictive landuse designations or environmental regulations that proscribe or restrict the siting of utilityscale solar facilities could adversely affect the marginal cost of such development 

in addition policies of the us presidential administration may create regulatory uncertainty in the renewable energy industry including the solar industry and our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected members of the us presidential administration including representatives of the us department of energy have made public statements that indicate that the administration may not be supportive of various clean energy programs and initiatives designed to curtail climate change for example in june 2017 the us president announced that the united states would withdraw from participation in the 2015 paris agreement on climate change mitigation in addition the administration has indicated that it may be supportive of overturning or modifying policies of or regulations enacted by the prior administration that placed limitations on gas and coal electricity generation mining andor exploration additionally in october 2017 the united states environmental protection agency “us epa” issued a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing to repeal the previous us presidential administration’s clean power plan “cpp” which established standards to limit carbon dioxide emissions from existing power generation facilities in june 2019 the us epa issued the final affordable clean energy “ace” rule and repealed the cpp under the ace rule 

emissions from electric utility generation facilities would be regulated only through the use of various “inside the fence” or onsite efficiency improvements and emission control technologies in contrast the cpp allowed facility owners to reduce emissions with “outside the fence” measures including those associated with renewable energy projects while the ace rule is currently subject to legal challenges and may be subject to future challenges the ultimate resolution of such challenges and the ultimate impact of the ace rule is uncertain as a result of the new ace rule and other policies or actions of the current us administration andor the us congress we may be subject to significant risks including the following 

 

 

 

application of us trade laws or trade laws of other countries may also impact either directly or indirectly our operating results for example in january 2018 following a petition filed by a usbased manufacturer of solar cells under sections 201 and 202 of the trade act of 1974 for global safeguard relief with the us international trade commission the “usitc” requesting among other things the imposition of certain tariffs on crystalline silicon solar cells imported into the united states and the establishment of a minimum price per watt on imported crystalline silicon solar modules the us president proclaimed tariffs on imported crystalline silicon modules and a tariffrate quota on imported crystalline silicon cells over a fouryear period with the tariff on modules and the tariff on cells above the first 25 gw dc of imports starting at 30 for the february 2018 to february 2019 period and declining by five percentage points in each subsequent 12month period thin film solar cell products such as our cdte technology are expressly excluded from the tariffs the office of the united states trade representative the “ustr” has also granted certain requests that particular types of solar products be excluded from the tariffs among these was an exclusion for bifacial solar modules that was issued on june 13 2019 in a notice published on october 9 2019 the ustr announced that 

it will withdraw the exclusion for bifacial solar modules effective october 28 2019 however on december 5 2019 the united states court of international trade overturned the announcement by issuing a preliminary injunction ordering the exclusion of bifacial solar modules from the tariffs on january 27 2020 the ustr announced a public comment process regarding the possible retention or withdrawal of the exclusion for bifacial solar modules but such process has been challenged at the united states court of international trade in addition the usitc has reviewed developments regarding the relevant domestic industry including its efforts to adjust to import competition and provided a report to the us president in february 2020 the usitc is also reviewing the probable effects of increasing the tariffrate quota for solar cells from 25 gw dc to 4 5 or 6 gw dc  and is scheduled to report its advice to the ustr in march 2020 such reports could serve as a basis for the us president to reduce modify or terminate the safeguard tariffs 

the united states has also imposed import tariffs in connection with other proceedings during 2018 and 2019 in march 2018 the us president proclaimed tariffs on certain imported aluminum and steel articles generally at rates of 10 and 25 respectively under section 232 of the trade expansion act of 1962 currently all countries except argentina australia canada and mexico are covered by the aluminum tariff and all countries except argentina australia brazil canada mexico and south korea are covered by the steel tariff in addition in may 2018 the us president proclaimed absolute quotas for the import of aluminum articles from argentina and the import of steel articles from argentina brazil and south korea in january 2020 the us president announced the expansion of tariffs under section 232 to cover certain derivative steel and aluminum articles separately in a series of actions during 2018 and 2019 that followed an investigation under section 301 of the trade act of 1974 the united states imposed tariffs on various articles imported from china at a rate of 25 including crystalline silicon solar cells and modules and various other articles in august 2019 the us president announced that the section 301 tariff on various products including crystalline silicon solar cells and modules would increase to 30 but such increase was later postponed in connection with uschina negotiations in december 2019 the united states and china announced a “phase one” economic and trade agreement whereby the us section 301 tariffs on various products including crystalline silicon solar cells and modules would remain at 25 while section 301 tariffs on certain other products would be lowered from 15 to 75 

internationally in july 2018 the indian government imposed a safeguard duty on solar cells and modules imported from various countries including member countries of the organisation for economic cooperation and development “oecd” china and malaysia for a twoyear period starting at 25 through july 2019 and declining by five percentage points in each subsequent sixmonth period in addition in march 2019 the indian government issued technical guidelines related to the enlistment of approved models and manufacturers of pv solar modules pursuant to the regulations after march 2020 all projects owned by the indian government or from which energy would be supplied to the government would be required to procure eligible components from these enlisted manufacturers the enlistment procedures have certain distinguishing criteria depending on whether a manufacturer is located inside or outside of india which may restrict our ability to access the indian market such tariffs and policies or any other us or global trade remedies or other trade barriers may directly or indirectly affect us or global markets for solar energy and our business financial condition and results of operations 

these examples show that established markets for pv solar development face uncertainties arising from policy regulatory and governmental constraints while the expected potential of the markets we are targeting is significant policy promulgation and market development are especially vulnerable to governmental inertia political instability the imposition of trade remedies and other trade barriers geopolitical risk fossil fuel subsidization potentially stringent localization requirements and limited available infrastructure 

we may be unable to fully execute on our longterm strategic plans which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we face numerous difficulties in executing on our longterm strategic plans particularly in new foreign jurisdictions including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



in addition please see the risk factors entitled “ our substantial international operations subject us to a number of risks including unfavorable political regulatory labor and tax conditions in the united states andor foreign countries ” and “ the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives tax incentives renewable energy targets and other support for ongrid solar electricity applications or other adverse public policies such as tariffs or other trade remedies imposed on solar cells and modules could negatively impact demand andor price levels for our solar modules and systems and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales thereby adversely impacting our operating results ” 

the loss of any of our large customers or their inability to perform under their contracts with us could significantly reduce our net sales and negatively impact our results of operations 

our customers include integrators and operators of systems utilities independent power producers commercial and industrial companies and other system owners who may experience intense competition at the system level thereby constraining the ability for such customers to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability the loss of any of our large customers their inability to perform under their contracts or their default in payment could significantly reduce our net sales andor adversely impact our operating results while our contracts with customers typically have certain firm purchase commitments and may include provisions for the payment of amounts to us in certain events of contract termination these contracts may be subject to amendments made by us or requested by our customers these amendments may reduce the volume of modules to be sold under the contract adjust delivery schedules or otherwise decrease the expected revenue under these contracts although we believe that we can mitigate this risk in part by reallocating modules to other customers if the need arises we may be unable in whole or in part to do so on similar terms or at all we may also mitigate this risk by requiring some form of payment security from our customers such as parent guarantees bank guarantees surety bonds or commercial letters of credit however in the event the providers of such payment security fail to perform their obligations our operating results could be adversely impacted 

we may be unable to profitably provide new solar offerings or achieve sufficient market penetration with such offerings 

we may expand our portfolio of offerings to include solutions that build upon our core competencies but for which we have not had significant historical experience including variations in our traditional product offerings or other offerings related to commercial and industrial customers and community solar we cannot be certain that we will be able to ascertain and allocate the appropriate financial and human resources necessary to grow these business areas we could invest capital into growing these businesses but fail to address market or customer needs or otherwise not experience a satisfactory level of financial return also in expanding into these areas we may be competing against companies that previously have not been significant competitors such as companies that currently have substantially more experience than we do in the residential commercial and industrial or other targeted offerings if we are unable to achieve growth in these areas our overall growth and financial performance may be limited relative to our competitors and our operating results could be adversely impacted 

an increase in interest rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets including a reduction in total tax equity availability could make it difficult for customers to finance the cost of a pv solar power system and could reduce the demand for our modules or systems andor lead to a reduction in the average selling price for such offerings  

many of our customers and our systems business depend on debt andor equity financing to fund the initial capital expenditure required to develop build andor purchase a pv solar power system as a result an increase in interest rates or a reduction in the supply of project debt financing or tax equity investments could reduce the number of solar projects that receive financing or otherwise make it difficult for our customers or our systems business to secure the financing necessary to develop build purchase or install a pv solar power system on favorable terms or at all and thus lower demand for our solar modules which could limit our growth or reduce our net sales see the risk factor entitled “ the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives tax incentives renewable energy targets and other support for ongrid solar electricity applications or other adverse public policies 

such as tariffs or other trade remedies imposed on solar cells and modules could negatively impact demand andor price levels for our solar modules and systems and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales thereby adversely impacting our operating results ” for additional information in addition we believe that a significant percentage of our customers install systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt an increase in interest rates could lower an investor’s return on investment in a system increase equity return requirements or make alternative investments more attractive relative to pv solar power systems and in each case could cause these customers to seek alternative investments 

risks related to our operations manufacturing and technology 

our future success depends on our ability to effectively balance manufacturing production with market demand convert existing production facilities to support new product lines decrease our manufacturing cost per watt and when necessary continue to build new manufacturing plants over time in response to market demand all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties  

our future success depends on our ability to effectively balance manufacturing production with market demand convert existing production facilities to support new product lines decrease our manufacturing cost per watt and increase our manufacturing capacity in a costeffective and efficient manner if we cannot do so we may be unable to decrease our manufacturing cost per watt maintain our competitive position sustain profitability expand our business or create longterm shareholder value our ability to decrease our manufacturing cost per watt expand production capacity or convert existing production facilities to support new product lines is subject to significant risks and uncertainties including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules if global supply exceeds global demand it could lead to a further reduction in the average selling price for pv solar modules  which could reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations 

the solar and renewable energy industries are highly competitive and are continually evolving as participants strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete with the larger electric power industry within the global pv solar industry we face intense competition from crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers existing or future solar module manufacturers might be acquired by larger companies with significant capital resources thereby further intensifying competition with us in addition the introduction of a low cost disruptive technology could adversely affect our ability to compete which could reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations 

even if demand for solar modules continues to grow the rapid manufacturing capacity expansion undertaken by many module manufacturers particularly manufacturers of crystalline silicon cells and modules has created and may continue to cause periods of structural imbalance in which supply exceeds demand see the risk factor entitled “ competition in solar markets globally and across the solar value chain is intense and could remain that way for an extended period of time an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may continue to cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations ” for additional information in addition we believe any significant decrease in the cost of silicon feedstock or polysilicon would reduce the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon modules and lead to further pricing pressure for solar modules and potentially an oversupply of solar modules we also believe many crystalline silicon cell and wafer manufacturers have substantially transitioned from lower efficiency bsf multicrystalline cells the legacy technology against which we have generally competed in our markets to higher efficiency perc monocrystalline cells at competitive cost structures as a result we expect that in the near future our primary competition will be monocrystalline perc based modules with higher conversion efficiencies additionally while conventional solar modules including the solar modules we produce are monofacial meaning their ability to produce energy is a function of direct and diffuse irradiance on their front side certain manufacturers of monocrystalline perc solar modules are promoting bifacial modules that also capture diffuse irradiance on the back side of a module such technology can improve the overall energy production of a module relative to nameplate frontside efficiency when applied in certain applications and bos configurations which could potentially lower the overall levelized cost of electricity “lcoe” meaning the net present value of a system’s total life cycle costs divided by the quantity of energy that is expected to be produced over the system’s life of a system when compared to systems using conventional solar modules including the modules we produce additionally we believe that our competitors are evaluating the possibility of transitioning from ptype to ntype monocrystalline wafers and cells if successful such transition would further increase the efficiency and energy yield of their product finally many of our competitors are promoting modules with larger overall area based on the use of larger silicon wafers while the transition to such larger wafers would increase nameplate wattage we believe the associated production cost would not improve significantly 

during any such period our competitors could decide to reduce their sales prices in response to competition even below their manufacturing costs in order to generate sales and may do so for a sustained period other competitors may have direct or indirect access to sovereign capital which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time as a result we may be unable to sell our solar modules or systems at attractive prices or for a profit during any period of excess supply of solar modules which would reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations additionally we may decide to lower our average selling prices to certain customers in certain markets in response to competition which could also reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations 

problems with product quality or performance including our series 4 modules and series 6 modules may cause us to incur significant andor unexpected contractual damages andor warranty and related expenses damage our market reputation and prevent us from maintaining or increasing our market share 

we perform a variety of module quality and life tests under different conditions upon which we base our assessments of future module performance over the duration of the warranty however if our thin film solar modules including our series 4 modules and series 6 modules perform below expectations we could experience significant warranty and related expenses damage to our market reputation and erosion of our market share with respect to our modules we provide a limited warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for approximately 10 years we also typically warrant that modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 98 of their labeled power output rating during the first year with the warranty coverage reducing by 05 every year thereafter throughout the approximate 25year limited power output warranty period as an alternative form of our standard limited module power output warranty we also offer an aggregated or systemlevel limited module performance warranty this systemlevel limited module performance warranty is designed for utilityscale systems and provides 25year systemlevel energy degradation protection this warranty represents a practical expedient to address the challenge of identifying from the potential millions of modules installed in a utilityscale system individual modules that may be performing below warranty thresholds by focusing on the aggregate energy generated by the system rather than the power output of individual modules the systemlevel limited module performance warranty is typically calculated as a percentage of a system’s expected energy production adjusted for certain actual site conditions with the warranted level of performance declining each year in a linear fashion but never falling below 80 during the term of the warranty as a result of these warranty programs we bear the risk of product warranty claims long after we have sold our solar modules and recognized net sales 

if any of the assumptions used in estimating our module warranties prove incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses which could adversely impact our financial position operating results and cash flows although we have taken significant precautions to avoid a manufacturing excursion from occurring any manufacturing excursions including any commitments made by us to take remediation actions in respect of affected modules beyond the stated remedies in our warranties could adversely impact our reputation financial position operating results and cash flows 

although our module performance warranties extend for 25 years our oldest solar modules manufactured during the qualification of our pilot production line have only been in use since 2001 accordingly our warranties are based on a variety of quality and life tests that enable predictions of durability and future performance these predictions however could prove to be materially different from the actual performance during the warranty period causing us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective solar modules or provide financial remuneration in the future for example our solar modules including our series 4 modules and series 6 modules could suffer various failure modes including breakage delamination corrosion or performance degradation in excess of expectations and our manufacturing operations or supply chain could be subject to materials or process variations that could cause affected modules to fail or underperform compared to our expectations these risks could be amplified as we implement design and process changes in connection with our efforts to improve our products and accelerate module wattage as part of our longterm strategic plans and as we transition to series 6 module manufacturing in addition if we increase the number of installations in extreme climates we may experience increased failure rates due to deployment into such field conditions any widespread product failures may damage our market reputation cause our net sales to decline require us to repair or replace the defective modules or provide financial remuneration and result in us taking voluntary remedial measures beyond those required by our standard warranty terms to enhance customer satisfaction which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

in resolving claims under both the limited defect and power output warranties we typically have the option of either repairing or replacing the covered modules or under the limited power output warranty providing additional modules to remedy the power shortfall or making certain cash payments however historical versions of our module warranty did not provide a refund remedy consequently we may be obligated to repair or replace the covered modules under such historical programs as our manufacturing process may change from timetotime in accordance with our technology roadmap we may elect to stop production of older versions of our modules that would constitute compatible 

replacement modules in some jurisdictions our inability to provide compatible replacement modules could potentially expose us to liabilities beyond the limitations of our module warranties which could adversely impact our reputation financial position operating results and cash flows 

for pv solar power systems constructed for customers we typically provide limited warranties for defects in engineering design installation and bos part workmanship for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a system or a block within the system in resolving claims under such bos warranties we have the option of remedying the defect through repair or replacement as with our modules these warranties are based on a variety of quality and life tests that enable predictions of durability and future performance any failures in bos equipment or system construction beyond our expectations may also adversely impact our reputation financial position operating results and cash flows 

in addition our contracts with customers including contracts for the sale of series 6 modules may include provisions with particular product specifications minimum wattage requirements and specified delivery schedules these contracts may be terminated or we may incur significant liquidated damages or other damages if we fail to perform our contractual obligations in addition our costs to perform under these contracts may exceed our estimates which could adversely impact our profitability we have only recently commenced commercial production of our series 6 modules and have limited experience satisfying our obligations under the related sales arrangements any failures to comply with our contracts for the sale of our modules including our series 6 modules could adversely impact our reputation financial position operating results and cash flows 

our failure to further refine our technology reduce module manufacturing and bos costs and develop and introduce improved pv products could render our solar modules or systems uncompetitive and reduce our net sales profitability andor market share 

we need to continue to invest significant financial resources in rd to continue to improve our module conversion efficiencies lower the lcoe of our pv solar power systems and otherwise keep pace with technological advances in the solar industry however rd activities are inherently uncertain and we could encounter practical difficulties in commercializing our research results we seek to continuously improve our products and processes including for example certain planned improvements to our series 6 module manufacturing capabilities and the resulting changes carry potential risks in the form of delays performance additional costs or other unintended contingencies in addition our significant expenditures for rd may not produce corresponding benefits other companies are developing a variety of competing pv technologies including advanced multicrystalline silicon cells perc or advanced ptype crystalline silicon cells highefficiency ntype crystalline silicon cells bifacial solar modules copper indium gallium diselenide thin films amorphous silicon thin films and new emerging technologies such as hybrid perovskites which could produce solar modules or systems that prove more costeffective or have better performance than our solar modules or systems 

in addition other companies could potentially develop a highly reliable renewable energy system that mitigates the intermittent power generation drawback of many renewable energy systems or offer other valueadded improvements from the perspective of utilities and other system owners in which case such companies could compete with us even if the lcoe associated with such new systems is higher than that of our systems as a result our solar modules or systems may be negatively differentiated or rendered obsolete by the technological advances of our competitors which would reduce our net sales profitability andor market share in addition we often forward price our products and services in anticipation of future cost reductions and technology improvements and thus an inability to further refine our technology and execute our module technology and cost reduction roadmaps could adversely affect our operating results 

if our estimates regarding the future costs of collecting and recycling cdte solar modules covered by our solar module collection and recycling program are incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses and face a significant unplanned cash burden 

as necessary we fund any incremental amounts for our estimated collection and recycling obligations on an annual basis based on the estimated costs of collecting and recycling covered modules estimated rates of return on our restricted investments and an estimated solar module life of 25 years less amounts already funded in prior years we estimate the cost of our collection and recycling obligations based on the present value of the expected probabilityweighted future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules which includes estimates for the cost of packaging materials the cost of freight from the solar module installation sites to a recycling center material labor and capital costs the scale of recycling centers and an estimated thirdparty profit margin and return on risk for collection and recycling services we base these estimates on i our experience collecting and recycling our solar modules ii the expected timing of when our solar modules will be returned for recycling and iii the expected economic factors at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled if our estimates prove incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses and could also face a significant unplanned cash burden at the time we realize our estimates are incorrect or end users return their modules which could adversely affect our operating results in addition participating end users can return their modules covered under the collection and recycling program at any time as a result we could be required to collect and recycle covered cdte solar modules earlier than we expect 

our failure to protect our intellectual property rights may undermine our competitive position and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against thirdparty allegations of infringement may be costly 

protection of our proprietary processes methods and other technology is critical to our business failure to protect and monitor the use of our existing intellectual property rights could result in the loss of valuable technologies we rely primarily on patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property we regularly file patent applications to protect certain inventions arising from our rd and are currently pursuing such patent applications in various countries in accordance with our strategy for intellectual property in that jurisdiction our existing patents and future patents could be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents or if patents are issued to us such patents may not be sufficient to provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies 

we also rely on unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position although we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our associates and third parties to protect our intellectual property such confidentiality agreements are limited in duration and could be breached and may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary manufacturing expertise adequate remedies may not be available in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise in addition others may obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or legal means the failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes equipment technology trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise methods and compounds could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries especially any developing countries into which we may expand our operations in some countries we have not applied for patent trademark or copyright protection 

third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary technologies or other intellectual property rights which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology can be difficult and expensive additionally litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others we cannot ensure that the outcome of such potential litigation will be in our favor and such litigation may be costly and may divert management attention and other resources away from our business an adverse determination in any such litigation may impair our intellectual property rights and may harm our business prospects and reputation in addition we have no insurance coverage against such litigation costs and would have to bear all costs arising from such litigation to the extent we are unable to recover them from other parties 

some of our manufacturing equipment is customized and sole sourced if our manufacturing equipment fails or if our equipment suppliers fail to perform under their contracts we could experience production disruptions and be unable to satisfy our contractual requirements 

some of our manufacturing equipment including manufacturing equipment related to the production of our series 6 modules is customized to our production lines based on designs or specifications that we provide to equipment manufacturers which then undertake a specialized process to manufacture the custom equipment as a result the equipment is not readily available from multiple vendors and would be difficult to repair or replace if it were to become delayed damaged or stop working if any piece of equipment fails production along the entire production line could be interrupted in addition the failure of our equipment manufacturers to supply equipment in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms could delay our expansion or conversion plans otherwise disrupt our production schedule andor increase our manufacturing costs all of which would adversely impact our operating results 

several of our key raw materials and components are either singlesourced or sourced from a limited number of suppliers and their failure to perform could cause manufacturing delays and impair our ability to deliver solar modules to customers in the required quality and quantities and at a price that is profitable to us 

our failure to obtain raw materials and components that meet our quality quantity and cost requirements in a timely manner could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture our solar modules or increase our manufacturing costs several of our key raw materials and components are either singlesourced or sourced from a limited number of suppliers as a result the failure of any of our suppliers to perform could disrupt our supply chain and adversely impact our operations in addition some of our suppliers are smaller companies that may be unable to supply our increasing demand for raw materials and components as we expand our business we may be unable to identify new suppliers or qualify their products for use on our production lines in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms a constraint on our production may result in our inability to meet our capacity plans andor our obligations under our customer contracts which would have an adverse impact on our business additionally reductions in our production volume may put pressure on suppliers resulting in increased material and component costs 

a disruption in our supply chain for cdte could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture solar modules and could adversely impact our profitability and longterm growth prospects 

a key raw material used in our module production process is a cdte compound tellurium one of the main components of cdte is mainly produced as a byproduct of copper refining and therefore its supply is largely dependent upon demand for copper our supply of cdte could be limited if any of our current suppliers or any of our future suppliers are unable to acquire an adequate supply of tellurium in a timely manner or at commercially reasonable prices if our current suppliers or any of our future suppliers cannot obtain sufficient tellurium they could substantially increase prices or be unable to perform under their contracts furthermore if our competitors begin to use or increase their demand for tellurium our requirements for tellurium increase new applications for tellurium become available or adverse trade laws or policies restrict our ability to obtain tellurium from foreign vendors or make doing so cost prohibitive the supply of tellurium and related cdte compounds could be reduced and prices could increase as we may be unable to pass such increases in the costs of our raw materials through to our customers a substantial increase in tellurium prices or any limitations in the supply of tellurium could adversely impact our profitability and longterm growth objectives 

if any future production lines are not built in line with committed schedules it may adversely affect our future growth plans if any future production lines do not achieve operating metrics similar to our existing production lines our solar modules could perform below expectations and cause us to lose customers 

if we are unable to systematically replicate our production lines over time and achieve operating metrics similar to our existing production lines our manufacturing capacity could be substantially constrained our manufacturing costs per watt could increase and our growth could be limited such factors may result in lower net sales and lower net income than we anticipate for instance future production lines could produce solar modules that have lower conversion 

efficiencies higher failure rates andor higher rates of degradation than solar modules from our existing production lines and we could be unable to determine the cause of the lower operating metrics or develop and implement solutions to improve performance 

our substantial international operations subject us to a number of risks including unfavorable political regulatory labor and tax conditions in the united states andor foreign countries  

we have significant manufacturing development construction sales and marketing operations both within and outside the united states and expect to continue to expand our operations worldwide as a result we are subject to the legal political social tax and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions 

risks inherent to international operations include but are not limited to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

our business in foreign markets requires us to respond to rapid changes in market conditions in these countries our overall success as a global business depends in part on our ability to succeed in differing legal regulatory economic social and political conditions we may not be able to develop and implement policies and strategies that will be effective in each location where we do business 

risks related to our systems business 

project development or construction activities may not be successful projects under development may not receive required permits real property rights ppas interconnection and transmission arrangements or financing or construction may not commence or proceed as scheduled which could increase our costs and impair our ability to recover our investments  

the development and construction of solar energy generation facilities and other energy infrastructure projects involve numerous risks we may be required to spend significant sums for land and interconnection rights preliminary engineering permitting legal services and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built success in developing a particular project is contingent upon among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

 

 

successful completion of a particular project may be adversely affected delayed andor rendered infeasible by numerous factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

if we fail to complete the development of a solar energy project fail to meet one or more agreed upon target construction milestone dates fail to achieve systemlevel capacity or fail to meet other contract terms we may be subject to forfeiture of significant deposits under ppas or interconnection agreements or termination of such agreements incur significant liquidated damages penalties andor other obligations under other project related agreements and may not be able to recover our investment in the project if we are unable to complete the development of a solar energy project we may impair some or all of these capitalized investments which would have an adverse impact on our net income in the period in which the loss is recognized 

we may be unable to acquire or lease land obtain necessary interconnection and transmission rights andor obtain the approvals licenses permits and electric transmission grid interconnection and transmission rights necessary to build and operate pv solar power systems in a timely and cost effective manner and regulatory agencies local communities labor unions tribes or other third parties may delay prevent or increase the cost of construction and operation of the system we intend to build 

in order to construct and operate our pv solar power systems we need to acquire or lease land and rights of way obtain interconnection rights negotiate agreements with affected transmission systems and obtain all necessary federal state county local and foreign approvals licenses and permits as well as rights to interconnect the systems to the transmission grid and transmit energy generated from the system we may be unable to acquire the land or lease interests needed may not obtain or maintain satisfactory interconnection rights may have difficulty reaching agreements with affected transmission systems andor incur unexpected network upgrade costs may not receive or retain the requisite approvals permits licenses and interconnection and transmission rights or may encounter other problems that could delay or prevent us from successfully constructing and operating such systems 

many of our proposed projects are located on or require access through public lands administered by federal and state agencies pursuant to competitive public leasing and rightofway procedures and processes our projects may also be located on tribal land pursuant to land agreements that must be approved by tribal governments and federal agencies the authorization for the use construction and operation of systems and associated transmission facilities on federal state tribal and private lands will also require the assessment and evaluation of mineral rights private rightsofway and other easements environmental agricultural cultural recreational and aesthetic impacts and the likely mitigation of adverse impacts to these and other resources and uses the inability to obtain the required permits and other federal state local and tribal approvals and any excessive delays in obtaining such permits and approvals due for example to litigation or thirdparty appeals could potentially prevent us from successfully constructing and operating such systems in a timely manner and could result in the potential forfeiture of any deposit we have made with respect to a given project moreover project approvals subject to project modifications and conditions including mitigation requirements and costs could affect the financial success of a given project changing regulatory requirements and the discovery of unknown site conditions could also affect the financial success of a given project 

in addition local labor unions may increase the cost of project development in california and elsewhere we may also be subject to labor unavailability andor increased union labor requirements due to multiple simultaneous projects in a geographic region 

competition at the system level can be intense thereby potentially exerting downward pressure on systemlevel profit margins industrywide which could reduce our profitability and adversely affect our results of operations  

the significant decline in pv solar module prices over the last several years continues to create a challenging environment for module manufacturers but it has also helped drive demand for solar electricity worldwide aided by such lower module prices our customers and potential customers have in many cases been willing and able to bid aggressively for new projects and ppas using low cost assumptions for modules bos parts installation maintenance and other costs as the basis for such bids relatively low barriers to entry for solar project developers including those we compete with have led to depending on the market and other factors intense competition at the system level which may result in an environment in which systemlevel pricing falls rapidly thereby further increasing demand for solar energy solutions but constraining the ability for project developers and diversified companies such as first solar to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability accordingly while we believe our system offerings and experience are positively differentiated in many cases from that of our competitors we may fail to correctly identify our competitive position we may be unable to develop or maintain a sufficient magnitude of new system projects worldwide at economically attractive rates of return and we may not otherwise be able to achieve meaningful profitability under our longterm strategic plans 

depending on the market opportunity we may be at a disadvantage compared to potential systemlevel competitors for example certain of our competitors may have a stronger andor more established localized business presence in a particular geographic region certain of our competitors may be larger entities that have greater financial resources and greater overall brand name recognition than we do and as a result may be better positioned to impact customer behavior or adapt to changes in the industry or the economy as a whole certain competitors may also have direct or indirect access to sovereign capital andor other incentives which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time 

additionally depending on the geographic area certain potential customers may still be in the process of educating themselves about the points of differentiation among various available providers of pv solar energy solutions including a company’s proven overall experience and bankability system design and optimization expertise grid interconnection and stabilization expertise and proven om capabilities if we are unable over time to meaningfully differentiate our offerings at scale or if available competitive pricing is prioritized over the value we believe is added through our system offerings and experience from the viewpoint of our potential customer base our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

following an evaluation of the longterm sustainable cost structure competitiveness and riskadjusted returns of our us project development business we have determined it is in the best interest of our stockholders to explore options for this business line see item 1 “business – business segments – systems business – project development” for additional information 

we may not be able to obtain longterm contracts for the sale of power produced by our projects at prices and on other terms favorable to attract financing and other investments  with regard to projects for which electricity is or will be sold on an open contract basis rather than under a ppa our results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent prevailing spot electricity prices decline in an unexpected manner 

obtaining longterm contracts for the sale of power produced by our projects at prices and on other terms favorable to us is essential for obtaining financing and commencing construction of our projects we must compete for ppas against other developers of solar and renewable energy projects this intense competition for ppas has resulted in downward pressure on ppa pricing for newly contracted projects in addition we believe the solar industry may experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand that put downward pressure on module pricing this downward pressure on module pricing also creates downward pressure on ppa pricing for newly contracted projects see the risk factor entitled “ competition at the system level can be intense thereby potentially exerting downward pressure on systemlevel profit margins industrywide which could reduce our profitability and adversely affect our results of operations ” for additional information if falling ppa pricing results in forecasted project revenue that is insufficient 

to generate returns anticipated to be demanded in the project sale market our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

other sources of power such as natural gasfired power plants have historically been cheaper than the cost of solar power and certain types of generation projects such as natural gasfired power plants can deliver power on a firm basis the inability to compete successfully against other power producers or otherwise enter into ppas favorable to us would negatively affect our ability to develop and finance our projects and negatively impact our revenue in addition the availability of ppas is dependent on utility and corporate energy procurement practices that could evolve and shift allocation of market risks over time in addition ppa availability and terms are a function of a number of economic regulatory tax and public policy factors which are also subject to change furthermore certain of our projects may be scheduled for substantial completion prior to the commencement of a longterm ppa with a major offtaker in which case we would be required to enter into a stubperiod ppa for the intervening time period or sell down the project we may not be able to do either on terms that are commercially attractive to us finally the electricity from certain of our projects is or is expected to be sold on an open contract basis for a period of time rather than under a ppa if prevailing spot electricity prices relating to any such project were to decline in an unexpected manner such project may decline in value and our results of operations could otherwise be adversely affected 

even if we are able to obtain ppas favorable to us the ability of our offtake counterparties to fulfill their contractual obligations to us depends in part on their creditworthiness these counterparties such as our investorowned utility counterparties in the state of california which may have liability for damages associated with california’s recent wildfires could suffer a deterioration of their creditworthiness or become and in one case has become subject to bankruptcy insolvency or liquidation proceedings or otherwise for example in january 2019 pge corporation and pacific gas and electric company filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of title 11 of the united states code in the us bankruptcy court for the northern district of california if one or more of our counterparties becomes subject to bankruptcy insolvency or liquidation proceedings or if the creditworthiness of any counterparty deteriorates we could experience an underpayment or nonpayment under ppa agreements and our ability to attract debt or equity financing for our projects could be impaired 

lack of transmission capacity availability potential upgrade costs to the transmission grid and other system constraints could significantly impact our ability to build pv solar power systems and generate solar electricity power sales 

in order to deliver electricity from our pv solar power systems to our customers our projects generally need to connect to the transmission grid the lack of available capacity on the transmission grid could substantially impact our projects and cause reductions in project size delays in project implementation increases in costs from transmission upgrades and potential forfeitures of any deposit we have made with respect to a given project in addition there could be unexpected costs required to complete transmission and network upgrades that adversely impact the economic viability of our pv solar power systems these transmission and network issues and costs as well as issues relating to the availability of large equipment such as transformers and switchgear could significantly impact our ability to interconnect our systems to the transmission grid build such systems and generate solar electricity sales 

our systems business is largely dependent on us and third parties arranging financing from various sources which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms or in insufficient amounts 

the construction of large utilityscale solar power projects in many cases requires project financing including nonrecourse project specific debt financing in the bank loan market and institutional debt capital markets uncertainties exist as to whether our planned projects will be able to access the debt markets in a magnitude sufficient to finance their construction if we or purchasers of our projects are unable to arrange such financing or if it is only available on unfavorable terms we may be unable to fully execute our systems business plans in addition we generally expect to sell interests in our projects by raising project equity capital from taxoriented strategic industry and other equity investors such equity sources may not be available or may only be available in insufficient amounts or on unfavorable terms in which case our ability to sell interests in our projects may be delayed or limited and our business financial 

condition and results of operations may be adversely affected uncertainty in or adverse changes to tax policy or tax law including the amount of itc or accelerated depreciation and any limitations on the value or availability to potential investors of tax incentives that benefit solar energy projects such as the itc and accelerated depreciation deductions as well as the reduction of the us corporate income tax rate to 21 under the tax act which could reduce the value of these tax related incentives may reduce project values or negatively affect our ability to timely secure equity investment for our projects 

depending on prevailing conditions in the credit markets interest rates and other factors such financing may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms or in insufficient amounts if third parties are limited in their ability to access financing to support their purchase of system construction services from us we may not realize the cash flows that we expect from such sales which could adversely affect our ability to invest in our business andor generate revenue see also the risk factor above entitled “ an increase in interest rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets including a reduction in total tax equity availability could make it difficult for customers to finance the cost of a pv solar power system and could reduce the demand for our modules or systems andor lead to a reduction in the average selling price for such offerings  ” 

developing solar power projects may require significant upfront investment prior to the signing of an epc contract and commencing construction which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

solar power project development cycles which span the time between the identification of a site location and the construction of a system vary substantially and can take years to mature as a result of these long project development cycles we may need to make significant upfront investments of resources including for example payments for land rights large transmission and ppa deposits or other payments which may be nonrefundable in advance of the signing of epc contracts commencing construction receiving cash proceeds or recognizing any revenue our potential inability to enter into sales contracts with customers on favorable terms after making such upfront investments could cause us to forfeit certain nonrefundable payments or otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations furthermore we may become constrained in our ability to simultaneously fund our other business operations and these systems investments through our long project development cycles 

our liquidity may also be adversely affected to the extent the project sales market weakens and we are unable to sell interests in our solar projects on pricing timing and other terms commercially acceptable to us in such a scenario we may choose to continue to temporarily own and operate certain solar projects for a period of time after which interests in the projects may be sold to third parties 

inaccurate estimates of costs under fixedprice epc agreements in which we are acting as the general contractor for our customers in connection with the construction and installation of their pv solar power systems could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we have entered into fixedprice epc contracts in which we act as the general contractor for our customers in connection with the installation of their pv solar power systems all essential costs are estimated at the time of entering into the epc contract for a particular project and these are reflected in the overall fixedprice that we charge our customers for the project these cost estimates are preliminary and may or may not be covered by contracts between us or the subcontractors suppliers and other parties to the project in addition we require qualified licensed subcontractors to install many of our systems shortages of such skilled labor could significantly delay a project or otherwise increase our costs should actual results prove different from our estimates including those due to unexpected increases in inflation commodity prices or labor costs or we experience delays in execution and we are unable to commensurately increase the epc sales price we may not achieve our expected margins or we may be required to record a loss in the relevant period 

we may be subject to unforeseen costs liabilities or obligations when providing om services in addition certain of our om agreements include provisions permitting the counterparty to terminate the agreement without cause 

we may provide ongoing om services to system owners under separate service agreements pursuant to which we generally perform standard activities associated with operating a pv solar power system including 247 monitoring and control compliance activities energy forecasting and scheduled and unscheduled maintenance our costs to perform these services are estimated at the time of entering into the om agreement for a particular project and these are reflected in the price we charge our customers including certain agreements which feature fixed pricing should our estimates of om costs prove inaccurate including any unexpected serial defects unavailability of parts or increases in inflation labor or bos costs our growth strategy and results of operations could be adversely affected because of the potentially longterm nature of these om agreements the adverse impacts on our results of operations could be significant up to our limitation of liability capped under the terms of the agreements in addition certain of our om agreements include provisions permitting the counterparty to terminate the agreement without cause or for convenience the exercise of such termination rights or the use of such rights as leverage to renegotiate terms and conditions of an om agreement including pricing terms could adversely impact our results of operations we may also be subject to substantial costs in the event we do not achieve certain thresholds under the effective availability guarantees included in our om agreements 

our systems business is subject to regulatory oversight and liability if we fail to operate pv solar power systems in compliance with electric reliability rules 

the ongoing om services that we provide for system owners may subject us to regulation by the nerc or its designated regional representative as a “generator operator” or “gop” under electric reliability rules filed with ferc our failure to comply with the reliability rules applicable to gops could subject us to substantial fines by nerc subject to ferc’s review in addition the system owners that receive our om services may be regulated by nerc as “generator owners” or “gos” and we may incur liability for go violations and fines levied by nerc subject to ferc’s review based on the terms of our om agreements finally as a system owner and operator we may in the future be subject to regulation by nerc as a go 

risks related to regulations 

existing regulations and policies changes thereto and new regulations and policies may present technical regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of pv solar products or systems which may significantly reduce demand for our modules systems or services 

the market for electricity generation products is heavily influenced by federal state local and foreign government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry as well as policies promulgated by electric utilities these regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and interconnection of customerowned electricity generation in the united states and in a number of other countries these regulations and policies have been modified in the past and may be modified again in the future these regulations and policies could deter enduser purchases of pv solar products or systems and investment in the rd of pv solar technology for example without a mandated regulatory exception for pv solar power systems system owners are often charged interconnection or standby fees for putting distributed power generation on the electric utility grid to the extent these interconnection standby fees are applicable to pv solar power systems it is likely that they would increase the cost of such systems which could make the systems less desirable thereby adversely affecting our business financial condition and results of operations in addition with respect to utilities that utilize a peakhour pricing policy or timeofuse pricing methods whereby the price of electricity is adjusted based on electricity supply and demand electricity generated by pv solar power systems currently benefits from competing primarily with expensive peakhour electricity rather than the less expensive average price of electricity modifications to the peakhour pricing policies of utilities such as to a flat rate for all times of the day would require pv solar power systems to have lower prices in order to compete with the price of electricity from other sources which could adversely impact our operating results 

our modules systems and services are often subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with national and local ordinances relating to building codes safety environmental protection utility interconnection and metering and other matters and tracking the requirements of individual jurisdictions is complex any new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to our modules systems or services may result in significant additional expenses to us or our customers and as a result could cause a significant reduction in demand for our modules systems or services in addition any regulatory compliance failure could result in significant management distraction unplanned costs andor reputational damage 

we could be adversely affected by any violations of the fcpa the uk bribery act and other foreign antibribery laws  

the fcpa generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business other countries in which we operate also have antibribery laws some of which prohibit improper payments to government and nongovernment persons and entities and others eg the fcpa and the uk bribery act extend their application to activities outside their country of origin our policies mandate compliance with all applicable antibribery laws we currently operate in and may further expand into key parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices in addition due to the level of regulation in our industry our operations in certain jurisdictions including china india south america and the middle east require substantial government contact either directly by us or through intermediaries over whom we have less direct control such as subcontractors agents and partners such as joint venture partners where norms can differ from us standards although we have implemented policies procedures and in certain cases contractual arrangements designed to facilitate compliance with these antibribery laws our officers directors associates subcontractors agents and partners may take actions in violation of our policies procedures contractual arrangements and antibribery laws any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could subject us and such persons to criminal andor civil penalties or other sanctions potentially by government prosecutors from more than one country which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and reputation 

environmental obligations and liabilities could have a substantial negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations  

our operations involve the use handling generation processing storage transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations at the national state local and international levels these environmental laws and regulations include those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the use management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites and occupational health and safety as we expand our business into foreign jurisdictions worldwide our environmental compliance burden may continue to increase both in terms of magnitude and complexity we have incurred and may continue to incur significant costs in complying with these laws and regulations in addition violations of or liabilities under environmental laws or permits may result in restrictions being imposed on our operating activities or in our being subject to substantial fines penalties criminal proceedings thirdparty property damage or personal injury claims cleanup costs or other costs such solutions could also result in substantial delay or termination of projects under construction within our systems business which could adversely impact our results of operations while we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements future developments such as more aggressive enforcement policies the implementation of new more stringent laws and regulations or the discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our solar modules contain cdte and other semiconductor materials elemental cadmium and certain of its compounds are regulated as hazardous materials due to the adverse health effects that may arise from human exposure based on existing research the risks of exposure to cdte are not believed to be as serious as those relating to exposure to elemental cadmium in our manufacturing operations we maintain engineering controls to minimize our associates’ exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds and require our associates who handle cadmium compounds to follow certain safety 

procedures including the use of personal protective equipment such as respirators chemical goggles and protective clothing relevant studies and thirdparty peer reviews of our technology have concluded that the risk of exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds from our endproducts is negligible in addition the risk of exposure is further minimized by the encapsulated nature of these materials in our products the physical properties of cadmium compounds used in our products and the recycling or responsible disposal of our modules while we believe that these factors and procedures are sufficient to protect our associates end users and the general public from adverse health effects that may arise from cadmium exposure we cannot ensure that human or environmental exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds used in our products will not occur any such exposure could result in future thirdparty claims against us damage to our reputation and heightened regulatory scrutiny which could limit or impair our ability to sell and distribute our products the occurrence of future events such as these could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the use of cadmium or cadmium compounds in various products is also coming under increasingly stringent governmental regulation future regulation in this area could impact the manufacturing sale collection and recycling of solar modules and could require us to make unforeseen environmental expenditures or limit our ability to sell and distribute our products for example european union directive 201165eu on the restriction of the use of hazardous substances “rohs” in electrical and electronic equipment the “rohs directive” restricts the use of certain hazardous substances including cadmium and its compounds in specified products other jurisdictions such as china have adopted similar legislation or are considering doing so currently pv solar modules are explicitly excluded from the scope of rohs article 2 as adopted by the european parliament and the council in june 2011 the next general review of the rohs directive is scheduled for 2021 involving a broader discussion of the existing scope a scope review focusing on additional exclusions was proposed by the european commission in 2017 under the eu’s codecision process which allows the european parliament and the european council to amend the european commission’s proposal on exclusions the codecision procedure was completed in 2017 and the existing exclusion of pv modules was maintained in preparation for the next rohs revision the european commission has started a number of preregulatory studies and assessments relating to the addition of new substances to the existing rohs framework as well as the revision and optimization of the exemption process it is unclear to what extent the existing scope exclusions will be discussed or maintained in future directives if pv modules were to be included in the scope of future rohs revisions without an exemption or exclusion we would be required to redesign our solar modules to reduce cadmium and other affected hazardous substances to the maximum allowable concentration thresholds in the rohs directive in order to continue to offer them for sale within the eu as such actions would be impractical this type of regulatory development would effectively close the eu market to us which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as an owner and operator of pv solar power systems that deliver electricity to the grid certain of our affiliated entities may be regulated as public utilities under us federal and state law which could adversely affect the cost of doing business and limit our growth  

as an owner and operator of pv solar power systems that deliver electricity to the grid certain of our affiliated entities may be considered public utilities for purposes of the federal power act as amended the “fpa” and public utility companies for purposes of the public utility holding company act of 2005 “puhca 2005” and are subject to regulation by the ferc as well as various local and state regulatory bodies some of our affiliated entities may be exempt wholesale generators or qualifying facilities under the public utility regulatory policies act of 1978 as amended “purpa” and as such are exempt from regulation under puhca 2005 in addition our affiliated entities may be exempt from most provisions of the fpa as well as state laws regarding the financial or organizational regulation of public utilities we are not directly subject to ferc regulation under the fpa however we are considered to be a “holding company” for purposes of section 203 of the fpa which regulates certain transactions involving public utilities and such regulation could adversely affect our ability to grow the business through acquisitions likewise investors seeking to acquire our public utility subsidiaries or acquire ownership interests in our securities sufficient to give them control over us and our public utility subsidiaries may require prior ferc approval to do so such approval could result in transaction delays or uncertainties 

public utilities under the fpa are required to obtain ferc acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of electricity and to comply with various regulations the ferc may grant our affiliated entities the authority to sell electricity at marketbased rates and may also grant them certain regulatory waivers such as waivers from compliance with ferc’s accounting regulations these ferc orders reserve the right to revoke or revise marketbased sales authority if the ferc subsequently determines that our affiliated entities can exercise market power in the sale of generation products the provision of transmission services or if it finds that any of the entities can create barriers to entry by competitors in addition if the entities fail to comply with certain reporting obligations the ferc may revoke their power sales tariffs finally if the entities were deemed to have engaged in manipulative or deceptive practices concerning their power sales transactions they would be subject to potential fines disgorgement of profits andor suspension or revocation of their marketbased rate authority if our affiliated entities were to lose their marketbased rate authority such companies would be required to obtain the ferc’s acceptance of a costofservice rate schedule and could become subject to the accounting recordkeeping and reporting requirements that are imposed on utilities with costbased rate schedules which would impose cost and compliance burdens on us and have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition to the risks described above we may be subject to additional regulatory regimes at state or foreign levels to the extent we own and operate pv solar power systems in such jurisdictions 

other risks 

we are subject to litigation risks including securities class actions and stockholder derivative actions which may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain 

from time to time we are subject to legal claims with and without merit that may be costly and which may divert the attention of our management and our resources in general in addition our projects may be subject to litigation or other adverse proceedings that may adversely impact our ability to proceed with construction or sell a given project the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict moreover many of the complaints filed against us do not specify the amount of damages that plaintiffs seek and we therefore are unable to estimate the possible range of damages that might be incurred should these lawsuits be resolved against us even if we are able to estimate losses related to these actions the ultimate amount of loss may be materially higher than our estimates certain of these lawsuits assert types of claims that if resolved against us could give rise to substantial damages and an unfavorable outcome or settlement of one or more of these lawsuits or any future lawsuits may result in a significant monetary judgment or award against us or a significant monetary payment by us and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations even if these lawsuits or any future lawsuits are not resolved against us the costs of defending such lawsuits and of any settlement may be significant these costs may exceed the dollar limits of our insurance policies or may not be covered at all by our insurance policies because the price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile we can provide no assurance that additional securities or other litigation will not be filed against us in the future see note 14 “commitments and contingencies – legal proceedings” to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our legal proceedings including our securities class action and derivative actions 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future business combinations or acquisition transactions and integration of business combinations may disrupt our business and management 

we have made several acquisitions in prior years and in the future we may acquire additional companies project pipelines products equity interests or technologies or enter into joint ventures or other strategic initiatives we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such business combinations or acquisitions and each transaction has numerous risks which may include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mergers and acquisitions of companies are inherently risky and ultimately if we do not complete the integration of acquired businesses successfully and in a timely manner we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions to the extent anticipated which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations in addition we may seek to dispose of our interests in acquired companies project pipelines products or technologies we may not recover our initial investment in such interests in part or at all which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our future success depends on our ability to retain our key associates and to successfully integrate them into our management team 

we are dependent on the services of our executive officers and other members of our senior management team the loss of one or more of these key associates or any other member of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business we may not be able to retain or replace these key associates and may not have adequate succession plans in place several of our current key associates including our executive officers are subject to employment conditions or arrangements that contain postemployment noncompetition provisions however these arrangements permit the associates to terminate their employment with us upon little or no notice 

if we are unable to attract train and retain key personnel our business may be materially and adversely affected 

our future success depends to a significant extent on our ability to attract train and retain management operations sales training and technical personnel including personnel in foreign jurisdictions recruiting and retaining capable personnel particularly those with expertise in the pv solar industry across a variety of technologies are vital to our success there is substantial competition for qualified technical personnel and while we continue to benchmark our organization against the broad spectrum of business in our market space to remain economically competitive there can be no assurances that we will be able to attract and retain our technical personnel if we are unable to attract and retain qualified associates or otherwise experience unexpected labor disruptions within our business we may be materially and adversely affected 

we may be exposed to infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties which if determined adversely to us could cause us to pay significant damage awards or prohibit us from the manufacture and sale of our solar modules or the use of our technology 

our success depends largely on our ability to use and develop our technology and knowhow without infringing or misappropriating the intellectual property rights of third parties the validity and scope of claims relating to pv solar technology patents involve complex scientific legal and factual considerations and analysis and therefore may be highly uncertain we may be subject to litigation involving claims of patent infringement or violation of intellectual property rights of third parties the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits patent opposition proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings can be both costly and time consuming and may significantly divert the efforts and resources of our technical and management personnel an adverse determination in any such litigation or proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liability to third parties require us to seek licenses from third parties which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all or pay ongoing royalties require us to redesign our solar modules or subject us to injunctions prohibiting the manufacture and sale of our solar modules or the use of our technologies protracted litigation could also result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of our solar modules until the resolution of such litigation 

currency translation and transaction risk may negatively affect our results of operations 

although our reporting currency is the us dollar we conduct certain business and incur costs in the local currency of most countries in which we operate as a result we are subject to currency translation and transaction risk for example certain of our net sales in 2019 were denominated in foreign currencies such as australian dollar and euro  and we expect to continue to have net sales denominated in foreign currencies in the future joint ventures or other business arrangements with strategic partners outside the united states have involved and in the future may involve significant investments denominated in local currencies changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar could affect our results of operations and result in exchange gains or losses we cannot accurately predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations 

we could also expand our business into emerging markets many of which have an uncertain regulatory environment relating to currency policy conducting business in such emerging markets could cause our exposure to changes in exchange rates to increase due to the relatively high volatility associated with emerging market currencies and potentially longer payment terms for our proceeds 

our ability to hedge foreign currency exposure is dependent on our credit profile with the banks that are willing and able to do business with us deterioration in our credit position or a significant tightening of the credit market conditions could limit our ability to hedge our foreign currency exposures and therefore result in exchange gains or losses 

our largest stockholder has significant influence over us and his interests may conflict with or differ from interests of other stockholders 

our largest stockholder lukas t walton the “significant stockholder” owned approximately 21 of our outstanding common stock as of december 31 2019  as a result the significant stockholder has substantial influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of our directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions such as mergers tender offers and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets the interests of the significant stockholder could conflict with or differ from interests of other stockholders for example the concentration of ownership held by the significant stockholder could delay defer or prevent a change of control of our company or impede a merger takeover or other business combination which other stockholders may view favorably 

if our longlived assets or project related assets become impaired we may be required to record significant charges to earnings 

we may be required to record significant charges to earnings should we determine that our longlived assets or project related assets are impaired such charges may have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations we review longlived and project related assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable we consider a project commercially viable or recoverable if it is anticipated to be sold for a profit once it is either fully developed or fully constructed or if the expected operating cash flows from future power generation exceed the cost basis of the asset if our projects are not considered commercially viable we would be required to impair the respective assets 

unanticipated changes in our tax provision the enactment of new tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the jurisdictions in which we operate in december 2017 the united states enacted the tax act the changes included in the tax act are broad and complex and the final effects of the tax act may differ from the amounts provided elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k possibly materially due to among other things changes in regulations related to the tax act any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the tax act any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the tax act or actions we may take as a result of the tax act additionally longstanding international tax laws that determine each country’s jurisdictional tax rights in crossborder international trade continue to evolve as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting reporting requirements recommended by the oecd as these and other tax laws and regulations change our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we are subject to potential tax examinations in various jurisdictions and taxing authorities may disagree with our interpretations of us and foreign tax laws and may assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these examinations in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however the outcome of tax examinations cannot be predicted with certainty therefore the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of such examinations could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision which could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

in addition our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure losses of tax holidays changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings among countries with tax holidays or differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process any changes in our effective tax rate may materially and adversely impact our results of operations 

cyberattacks or other breaches of our information systems or those of third parties with which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations rely on our computer systems hardware software and networks as well as those of third parties with which we do business to securely process store and transmit proprietary confidential and other information including intellectual property we also rely heavily on these information systems to operate our manufacturing lines and pv solar power plants these information systems may be compromised by cyberattacks computer viruses and other events that could be materially disruptive to our business operations and could put the security of our information and that of the third parties with which we do business at risk of misappropriation or destruction in recent years such cyber incidents have become increasingly frequent and sophisticated targeting or otherwise affecting a wide range of companies while we have instituted security measures to minimize the likelihood and impact of a cyber incident there is no assurance that these measures or those of the third parties with which we do business will be adequate in the future if these measures fail valuable information may be lost our manufacturing development construction om and other operations may be disrupted we may be unable to fulfill our customer obligations and our reputation may suffer for example any cyber incident affecting our automated manufacturing lines could adversely affect our ability to produce solar modules or otherwise affect the quality and performance of the modules produced we may also be subject to litigation regulatory action remedial expenses and financial losses beyond the scope or limits of our insurance coverage these consequences of a failure of security measures could individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in or any failure to comply with privacy laws regulations and standards may adversely affect our business 

personal privacy and data security have become significant issues in the united states europe and in many other jurisdictions in which we operate the regulatory framework for privacy and security issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future furthermore federal state or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted and may in the future adopt laws and regulations affecting data privacy all of which may be subject to invalidation by relevant foreign judicial bodies industry organizations also regularly adopt and advocate for new standards in this area 

in the united states these include rules and regulations promulgated or pending under the authority of federal agencies state attorneys general legislatures and consumer protection agencies internationally many jurisdictions in which we operate have established their own data security and privacy legal framework with which we relevant suppliers and customers must comply for example the general data protection regulation a broadbased data privacy regime enacted by the european parliament which became effective in may 2018 imposes new requirements on how we collect process transfer and store personal data and also imposes additional obligations potential penalties and risk upon our business additionally the california consumer privacy act which becomes effective in january 2020 imposes similar data privacy requirements in many jurisdictions enforcement actions and consequences for noncompliance are also rising in addition to government regulation privacy advocates and industry groups may propose new and different selfregulatory standards that either legally or contractually apply to us although we have implemented policies procedures and in certain cases contractual arrangements designed to facilitate compliance with applicable privacy and data security laws and standards any inability or perceived inability to adequately address privacy and security concerns even if unfounded or comply with applicable privacy and data security laws regulations and policies could result in additional fines costs and liabilities to us damage our reputation inhibit sales and adversely affect our business 

our credit agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business 

we may be unable to respond to changes in business and economic conditions engage in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us and obtain additional financing if needed because the senior secured credit facility made available under our amended and restated credit agreement with several financial institutions as lenders and jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent the “revolving credit facility” and certain of our project financing 

arrangements contain and other future debt agreements may contain covenant restrictions that limit our ability to among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

under our revolving credit facility and certain of our project financing arrangements we are also subject to certain financial covenants our ability to comply with covenants under our credit agreements is dependent on our future performance or the performance of specifically financed projects which will be subject to many factors some of which are beyond our control including prevailing economic conditions in addition our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under these agreements and any of our other future debt agreements which if not cured or waived could permit the holders thereof to accelerate such debt and could cause crossdefaults under our other facility agreements and the possible acceleration of debt under such agreements as well as crossdefaults under certain of our key project and operational agreements and could also result in requirements to post additional security instruments to secure future obligations in addition certain events that occur within the company or in the industry or the economy as a whole may constitute material adverse effects under these agreements if it is determined that a material adverse effect has occurred the lenders can under certain circumstances restrict future borrowings or accelerate the due date of outstanding amounts if any of our debt is accelerated we may experience crossdefaults under our other debt or operational agreements which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

executive overview 

we are a leading global provider of comprehensive pv solar energy solutions we design manufacture and sell pv solar modules with an advanced thin film semiconductor technology and also develop and sell pv solar power systems that primarily use the modules we manufacture additionally we provide om services to system owners we have substantial ongoing rd efforts focused on various technology innovations we are the world’s largest thin film pv solar module manufacturer and one of the world’s largest pv solar module manufacturers 

certain of our financial results and other key operational developments for the year ended december 31 2019 include the following 

 

 

 



improved bos compatibility see note 21 “segment and geographical information ” to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our operating segments 

 

 

market overview 

the solar industry continues to be characterized by intense pricing competition both at the module and system levels in particular module average selling prices in many global markets have declined in recent years and are expected to continue to decline to some degree in the future in the aggregate we believe manufacturers of solar cells and modules have significant installed production capacity relative to global demand and the ability for additional capacity expansion we believe the solar industry may from time to time experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity exceeds global demand and that such periods will continue to put pressure on pricing additionally intense competition at the system level may result in an environment in which pricing falls rapidly thereby further increasing demand for solar energy solutions but constraining the ability for project developers and diversified module manufacturers to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability in light of such market realities we are focusing on our strategies and points of differentiation which include our advanced module technology our manufacturing process our diversified capabilities our financial viability and the sustainability advantage of our modules and systems 

global solar markets continue to expand and develop in part aided by demand elasticity resulting from declining industry average selling prices both at the module and system levels which have promoted the widespread adoption of solar energy as a result of such market opportunities we are expanding our manufacturing capacity while also developing and operating multiple solar projects around the world as we execute on our advancedstage utilityscale project pipeline we also continue to develop our earlytomidstage project pipeline and evaluate acquisitions of projects to further expand both our earlytomidstage and advancedstage pipelines see the tables under “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – systems project pipeline” for additional information about projects within our advancedstage pipeline although we expect a meaningful portion of our future consolidated net sales operating income and cash flows to be derived from such projects we expect thirdparty module sales to have a more significant impact on our operating results as we continue to expand our manufacturing capacity and leverage the benefits of our series 6 module technology 

lower industry module and system pricing is expected to continue to contribute to diversification in global electricity generation and further demand for solar energy solutions as such solutions compete economically with traditional forms of energy generation over time however declining average selling prices may adversely affect our results of operations to the extent we have not already entered into contracts for future module or system sales if competitors reduce pricing to levels below their costs bid aggressively low prices for module sale agreements or ppas or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time our results of operations could be further adversely affected in certain markets in california and elsewhere an oversupply imbalance at the grid level may reduce short 

tomedium term demand for new solar installations relative to prior years lower ppa pricing and lower margins on module and system sales to such markets however we believe the effects of such imbalance can be mitigated by modern solar power plants that offer a flexible operating profile thereby promoting greater grid stability and enabling a higher penetration of solar energy we continue to address these uncertainties in part by executing on our module technology improvements continuing the development of key markets partnering with grid operators and utility companies and implementing certain other cost reduction initiatives 

we face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules and developers of solar power projects solar module manufacturers compete with one another on price and on several module value attributes including wattage or conversion efficiency energy yield and reliability and developers of systems compete on various factors such as net present value return on equity and lcoe many crystalline silicon cell and wafer manufacturers continue to transition from lower efficiency bsf multicrystalline cells the legacy technology against which we have generally competed in our markets to higher efficiency perc monocrystalline cells at competitive cost structures additionally while conventional solar modules including the solar modules we produce are monofacial meaning their ability to produce energy is a function of direct and diffuse irradiance on their front side certain manufacturers of monocrystalline perc modules are promoting bifacial modules that also capture diffuse irradiance on the back side of a module the cost effective manufacture of bifacial perc modules has been enabled in part by the expansion of inexpensive crystal growth and diamond wire saw capacity in china bifaciality compromises nameplate efficiency but by converting both front and rear side irradiance such technology may improve the overall energy production of a module relative to nameplate efficiency when applied in certain applications which after considering the incremental bos and other costs could potentially lower the overall lcoe of a system when compared to systems using conventional solar modules including the modules we produce 

we believe we are among the lowest cost module manufacturers in the solar industry on a module cost per watt basis based on publicly available information this cost competitiveness allows us to compete favorably in markets where pricing for modules and systems is highly competitive our cost competitiveness is based in large part on our module wattage or conversion efficiency proprietary manufacturing technology which enables us to produce a cdte module in a matter of hours using a continuous and highly automated industrial manufacturing process as opposed to a batch process and our focus on operational excellence in addition our cdte modules use approximately 12 of the amount of semiconductor material that is used to manufacture conventional crystalline silicon solar modules the cost of polysilicon is a significant driver of the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules and the timing and rate of change in the cost of silicon feedstock and polysilicon could lead to changes in solar module pricing levels in recent years polysilicon consumption per cell has been reduced through various initiatives such as the adoption of diamond wire saw technology which have contributed to declines in our relative manufacturing cost competitiveness over conventional crystalline silicon module manufacturers 

in terms of energy yield in many climates our cdte solar modules provide an energy production advantage over most monofacial crystalline silicon solar modules of equivalent efficiency rating for example our cdte solar modules provide a superior temperature coefficient which results in stronger system performance in typical high insolation climates as the majority of a system’s generation on average occurs when module temperatures are well above 25°c standard test conditions in addition our cdte solar modules provide a superior spectral response in humid environments where atmospheric moisture alters the solar spectrum relative to laboratory standards our cdte solar modules also provide a better shading response than conventional crystalline silicon solar modules which may lose up to three times as much power as cdte solar modules when shading occurs as a result of these and other factors our pv solar modules typically produce more annual energy in real world field conditions than conventional modules with the same nameplate capacity 

while our modules and systems are generally competitive in cost reliability and performance attributes there can be no guarantee such competitiveness will continue to exist in the future to the same extent or at all any declines in the competitiveness of our products could result in additional margin compression further declines in the average selling prices of our modules and systems erosion in our market share for modules and systems andor declines in overall net 

sales we continue to focus on enhancing the competitiveness of our solar modules and systems by accelerating progress along our module technology and cost reduction roadmaps 

certain trends and uncertainties 

we believe that our operations may be favorably or unfavorably impacted by the following trends and uncertainties that may affect our financial condition and results of operations see item 1a “risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for discussions of other risks that may affect our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

our longterm strategic plans are focused on our goal to create longterm shareholder value through a balance of growth profitability and liquidity in executing such plans we are focusing on providing utilityscale pv solar energy solutions using our modules in key geographic markets that we believe have a compelling need for massscale pv electricity including markets throughout the americas the asiapacific region europe and certain other strategic markets additionally we are focusing on opportunities in which our pv solar energy solutions can compete directly with traditional forms of energy generation on an lcoe or similar basis or complement such generation offerings such opportunities include the retirement and replacement of fossil fuelbased generation resources with utilityscale pv solar energy solutions for example cumulative global retirements of coal generation plants are expected to approximate 900 gw dc   by 2040 representing a significant increase in the potential market for solar energy 

this focus on our core module and utilityscale offerings exists within a current market environment that includes rooftop and distributed generation solar particularly in the united states while it is unclear how rooftop and distributed generation solar might impact our core utilityscale based offerings over the next several years we believe that utilityscale solar will continue to be a compelling offering for companies with technology and cost leadership and will continue to represent an increasing portion of the overall electricity generation mix however our module offerings in certain international markets may be driven in part by future demand for rooftop and distributed generation solar solutions 

our ability to provide utilityscale offerings on economically attractive terms depends in part on market factors outside our control such as interest rate fluctuations domestic or international trade policies and government support programs adverse changes in these factors could increase the cost of utilityscale systems which could reduce demand for such systems and limit the number of potential buyers 

we closely evaluate and monitor the appropriate level of resources required as we pursue the most advantageous and cost effective projects and partnerships in our key markets we have dedicated and intend to continue to dedicate significant capital and human resources to reduce the total installed cost of pv solar energy and to ensure that our solutions integrate well into the overall electricity ecosystem of each specific market we expect that over time the majority of our consolidated net sales operating income and cash flows will come from solar offerings in the key geographic markets described above the timing execution and financial impacts of our longterm strategic plans are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in item 1a “risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k we are focusing our resources in those markets and energy applications in which solar power can be a leastcost bestfit energy solution particularly in regions with significant current or projected electricity demand relatively high existing electricity prices strong demand for renewable energy generation and high solar resources 

creating or maintaining a market position in certain strategically targeted markets and energy applications also requires us to adapt to new and changing market conditions for example our offerings from time to time may need to be competitively priced at levels associated with minimal gross profit margins which may adversely affect our results of operations we expect the profitability associated with our various sales offerings to vary from one another over time and possibly vary from our internal longrange profitability expectations and targets depending on the market opportunity and the relative competitiveness of our offerings compared with other energy solutions traditional or otherwise that are available to potential customers in addition as we execute on our longterm strategic plans we will continue to monitor and adapt to any changing dynamics in emerging technologies such as commercially viable energy storage solutions which are expected to further enable pv solar power systems to compete with traditional forms of 

energy generation by shifting the delivery of energy generated by such systems to periods of greater demand storage solutions continue to evolve in terms of technology and cost and cumulative global deployments of storage capacity are expected to exceed 900 gw dc   by 2040 representing a significant increase in the potential market for renewable energy we will also continue to monitor and adapt to changing dynamics in the market set of potential buyers of solar projects market environments with few potential project buyers and a higher cost of capital would generally exert downward pressure on the potential revenue from the solar projects we are developing whereas conversely market environments with many potential project buyers and a lower cost of capital would likely have a favorable impact on the potential revenue from such solar projects 

on occasion we may temporarily own and operate certain systems with the intention to sell them at a later date we may also enter into business arrangements with strategic partners that result in us temporarily retaining an ownership interest in the underlying systems projects we develop supply modules to or construct potentially for a period of up to several years in these situations we may retain such ownership interests in a consolidated or unconsolidated separate entity we may also elect to construct and temporarily retain ownership interests in partially contracted or uncontracted systems for which there is a partial or no ppa with an offtaker such as a utility but rather an intent to sell some portion of the electricity produced by the system on an open contract basis until the system is sold expected revenue from projects without a ppa for the full offtake of the system is subject to greater variability and uncertainty based on market factors and is typically lower than projects with a ppa for the full offtake of the system furthermore all system pricing is effected by the pricing of energy to be sold on an open contract basis following the termination of the ppa ie merchant pricing curves and changes in market assumptions regarding future open contract sales may also result in significant variability and uncertainty in the value of our systems projects 

we continually evaluate forecasted global demand competition and our addressable market and seek to effectively balance manufacturing capacity with market demand and the nature and extent of our competition during 2019 we commenced commercial production of series 6 modules at our second manufacturing facility in ho chi minh city vietnam and our manufacturing facility in lake township ohio a short distance from our plant in perrysburg ohio these additional manufacturing plants and any other potential investments to add or otherwise modify our existing manufacturing capacity in response to market demand and competition may require significant internal and possibly external sources of capital and may be subject to certain risks and uncertainties described in item 1a “risk factors” including those described under the headings “ our future success depends on our ability to effectively balance manufacturing production with market demand convert existing production facilities to support new product lines decrease our manufacturing cost per watt and when necessary continue to build new manufacturing plants over time in response to market demand all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties ” and “ if any future production lines are not built in line with committed schedules it may adversely affect our future growth plans if any future production lines do not achieve operating metrics similar to our existing production lines our solar modules could perform below expectations and cause us to lose customers ” 

systems project pipeline 

the following tables summarize as of february 20 2020  our approximately 13 gw ac advancedstage project pipeline the actual volume of modules installed in our projects will be greater than the project size in mw ac as module volumes required for a project are based upon mw dc  which will be greater than the mw ac size pursuant to a dcac ratio typically ranging from 11 to 14 such ratio varies across different projects due to many factors including ppa pricing and the location design and costs of the system projects are typically removed from our advancedstage project pipeline tables below once we substantially complete construction of the project and after substantially all of the associated project revenue is recognized a project or a portion of a project may also be removed from the tables below in the event a project is not able to be sold due to the changing economics of the project or other factors or we decide to temporarily own and operate or retain interests in a project based on strategic opportunities or market factors 

as part of our transition to an external epc service model in the united states we no longer expect to provide epc services for the customer developed 51 mw ac troy solar project for which construction had not commenced 

accordingly we removed such project from the tables below as our arrangement with the customer now represents a thirdparty module sale

results of operations 

the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december 31 2019  2018  and 2017  



segment overview 

we operate our business in two segments our modules segment involves the design manufacture and sale of cdte solar modules to third parties and our systems segment includes the development construction operation maintenance and sale of pv solar power systems including any modules installed in such systems and any revenue from energy generated by such systems 

net sales 

modules business 

we generally price and sell our solar modules on a per watt basis during 2019  cypress creek renewables  longroad energy  and nextera energy each accounted for more than 10 of our modules business net sales and the majority of our solar modules were sold to integrators and operators of systems in the united states and france  substantially all of our modules business net sales during 2019 were denominated in us dollars and euro we recognize revenue for module sales at a point in time following the transfer of control of the modules to the customer which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery depending on the terms of the underlying contracts the revenue recognition policies for module sales are further described in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements 

systems business 

during 2019  edp renewables  connectgen  and innergex renewable energy each accounted for more than 10 of our systems business net sales and the majority of our systems business net sales were in the united states and australia  substantially all of our systems business net sales during 2019 were denominated in us dollars and australian dollars we typically recognize revenue for sales of solar power systems using cost based input methods which result in revenue being recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred compared to the total estimated costs for a given contract we may also recognize revenue for the sale of a development project which excludes epc services or for the sale of a completed system when we enter into the associated sales contract with the customer the revenue recognition policies for our systems business are further described in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements 

the following table shows net sales by reportable segment for the years ended december 31 2019  2018  and 2017  



net sales from our modules segment increased by 9581 million in 2019 primarily due to a 180 increase in the volume of watts sold and a 4 increase in the average selling price per watt net sales from our systems segment decreased by 1390 million in 2019 primarily as a result of the sale of the mashiko and certain india projects in 2018 and the completion of substantially all construction activities at the california flats willow springs and various other projects in florida in late 2018 and early 2019  partially offset by the sale of the sun streams sunshine valley and beryl projects and ongoing construction activities at the phoebe and ga solar 4 projects in 2019  

cost of sales 

modules business 

our modules business cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials and components for manufacturing solar modules such as glass transparent conductive coatings cdte and other thin film semiconductors laminate materials connector assemblies edge seal materials and frames in addition our cost of sales includes direct labor for the manufacturing of solar modules and manufacturing overhead such as engineering equipment maintenance quality and production control and information technology our cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing plant and equipment facilityrelated expenses environmental health and safety costs and costs associated with shipping warranties and solar module collection and recycling excluding accretion 

systems business 

for our systems business projectrelated costs include development costs legal consulting transmission upgrade interconnection permitting and other similar costs epc costs consisting primarily of solar modules inverters electrical and mounting hardware project management and engineering and construction labor and site specific costs 

the following table shows cost of sales by reportable segment for the years ended december 31 2019  2018  and 2017  



cost of sales increased 6620 million  or 36  and decreased 04 percentage points as a percent of net sales when comparing 2019 with 2018  the increase in cost of sales was driven by a 445 million increase in our systems segment cost of sales primarily due to the mix of lower gross profit projects sold or under construction during the period the increase in cost of sales was also driven by a 6176 million increase in our modules segment cost of sales primarily as a result of the following 

 

gross profit 

gross profit may be affected by numerous factors including the selling prices of our modules and systems our manufacturing costs project development costs bos costs the capacity utilization of our manufacturing facilities and foreign exchange rates gross profit may also be affected by the mix of net sales from our modules and systems businesses 

the following table shows gross profit for the years ended december 31 2019  2018  and 2017  



gross profit increased 04 percentage points to 179 during 2019 from 175 during 2018 primarily as a result of higher gross profit on thirdparty module sales improved utilization of our manufacturing facilities and the reduction to our product warranty liability described above partially offset by the mix of lower gross profit projects sold or under construction during the period the settlement of a tax examination with the state of california in 2018  which affected our estimates of sales and use taxes due for certain projects and the reduction to our module collection and recycling liability in 2018 described above 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated costs professional fees insurance costs and other business development and selling expenses 

the following table shows selling general and administrative expense for the years ended december 31 2019  2018  and 2017  



selling general and administrative expense in 2019 increased compared to 2018 primarily due to higher employee compensation expense lower accretion expense in 2018 associated with the reduction in our module collection and recycling liability described above and higher professional fees 

research and development 

research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated costs the cost of products materials and outside services used in our rd activities and depreciation and amortization expense associated with rd specific facilities and equipment we maintain a number of programs and activities to improve our technology and processes in order to enhance the performance and reduce the costs of our solar modules 

the following table shows research and development expense for the years ended december 31 2019  2018  and 2017  



research and development expense in 2019 increased compared to 2018 primarily due to increased material and module testing costs and higher employee compensation expense 

production startup 

production startup expense consists primarily of employee compensation and other costs associated with operating a production line before it is qualified for full production including the cost of raw materials for solar modules run through the production line during the qualification phase and applicable facility related costs costs related to equipment upgrades and implementation of manufacturing process improvements are also included in production startup expense as well as costs related to the selection of a new site related legal and regulatory costs and costs to maintain our plant replication program to the extent we cannot capitalize these expenditures in general we expect production startup expense per production line to be higher when we build an entirely new manufacturing facility compared with the addition or replacement of production lines at an existing manufacturing facility primarily due to the additional infrastructure investment required when building an entirely new facility 

the following table shows production startup expense for the years ended december 31 2019  2018  and 2017  



during 2019  we incurred production startup expense at our new facility in lake township ohio we also incurred production startup expense at our second facility in ho chi minh city vietnam in early 2019  during 2018  we incurred production startup expense for the transition to series 6 module manufacturing at our facilities in kulim malaysia and ho chi minh city vietnam we also incurred production startup expense for the transition to series 6 module manufacturing at our facility in perrysburg ohio in early 2018  

litigation loss 

the following table shows litigation loss for the years ended december 31 2019  2018  and 2017  



in january 2020 we entered into an mou to settle a class action lawsuit filed in 2012 in the united states district court for the district of arizona against the company and certain of our current and former officers and directors 

pursuant to the mou we agreed to pay a total of 350 million to settle the claims brought on behalf of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired the company’s shares during a specified period in exchange for mutual releases and a dismissal with prejudice of the complaint upon court approval of the settlement the proposed settlement contains no admission of liability wrongdoing or responsibility by any of the parties 

we are also party to a lawsuit filed in 2015 in the arizona district court by putative stockholders that opted out of the class action lawsuit described above during 2019 we accrued 13 million of estimated losses for this action which represents our best estimate of the lower bound of the costs to resolve this case the ultimate amount of loss may be materially higher 

see note 14 “commitments and contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on these matters 

restructuring and asset impairments 

restructuring and asset impairments consist of expenses incurred related to significant restructuring initiatives and includes any associated asset impairments costs for employee termination benefits costs for contract terminations and penalties and other restructuring related costs 

the following table shows restructuring and asset impairments for the years ended december 31 2019  2018  and 2017  



in november 2016 our board of directors approved a set of initiatives intended to accelerate our transition to series 6 module manufacturing and restructure our operations as part of these actions we recorded restructuring and asset impairment charges of 418 million during 2017  in 2017  we also reversed a customs tax liability associated with a prior restructuring activity which reduced our restructuring charges by 47 million during the period see note 4 “restructuring and asset impairments” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on these matters 

foreign currency income loss net 

foreign currency income loss net consists of the net effect of gains and losses resulting from holding assets and liabilities and conducting transactions denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries’ functional currencies 

the following table shows foreign currency income loss net for the years ended december 31 2019  2018  and 2017  



foreign currency income increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to lower costs associated with hedging activities related to our subsidiaries in japan and india 

interest income 

interest income is earned on our cash cash equivalents marketable securities and restricted cash and investments interest income also includes interest earned from notes receivable and late customer payments 

the following table shows interest income for the years ended december 31 2019  2018  and 2017  



interest income during 2019 decreased compared to 2018 primarily due to lower average balances of cash cash equivalents and time deposits and lower interest rates associated with restricted investments partially offset by higher interest rates on cash and cash equivalents 

interest expense net 

interest expense net is primarily comprised of interest incurred on longterm debt settlements of interest rate swap contracts and changes in the fair value of interest rate swap contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 815 we may capitalize interest expense to our project assets or property plant and equipment when such costs qualify for interest capitalization which reduces the amount of net interest expense reported in any given period 

the following table shows interest expense net for the years ended december 31 2019  2018  and 2017  



interest expense net in 2019 was consistent with interest expense net in 2018  

other income net 

other income net is primarily comprised of miscellaneous items and realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities and restricted investments 

the following table shows other income net for the years ended december 31 2019  2018  and 2017  



other income net decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to lower realized gains from the sales of restricted investments the impairment of a strategic investment and net charges associated with certain letter of credit arrangements 

income tax benefit expense 

income tax expense or benefit deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect our best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which we operate principally australia japan and malaysia significant judgments and estimates are required to determine our consolidated income tax expense the statutory federal corporate income tax rate in the united states is 21  and the tax rates in australia japan and malaysia are 30  306  and 24  respectively in malaysia we have been granted a longterm tax holiday scheduled to expire in 2027  pursuant to which substantially all of our income earned in malaysia is exempt from income tax conditional upon our continued compliance with certain employment and investment thresholds 

the following table shows income tax benefit expense for the years ended december 31 2019  2018  and 2017  



our tax rate is affected by recurring items such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions the rate is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from period to period income tax expense decreased by 89 million during 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to our pretax loss in the current period partially offset by discrete tax expenses associated with filing tax returns in certain foreign jurisdictions 

equity in earnings net of tax 

equity in earnings net of tax represents our proportionate share of the earnings or losses from equity method investments as well as any gains or losses on the sale or disposal of such investments 

the following table shows equity in earnings net of tax for the years ended december 31 2019  2018  and 2017  



equity in earnings net of tax decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to the sale of our ownership interests in 8point3 operating company llc “opco” which resulted in a gain of 403 million  net of tax in 2018  see note 8 “consolidated balance sheet details” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2019  we believe that our cash cash equivalents marketable securities cash flows from operating activities contracts with customers for the future sale of solar modules advancedstage project pipeline availability under our revolving credit facility considering the minimum liquidity covenant requirements therein and access to the capital markets will be sufficient to meet our working capital systems project investment and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months we monitor our working capital to ensure we have adequate liquidity both domestically and internationally 

we intend to maintain appropriate debt levels based upon cash flow expectations our overall cost of capital and expected cash requirements for operations capital expenditures and strategic discretionary spending in the future we may also engage in additional debt or equity financings including project specific debt financings we believe that when necessary we will have adequate access to the capital markets although our ability to raise capital on terms commercially acceptable to us could be constrained if there is insufficient lender or investor interest due to industrywide or companyspecific concerns such financings could result in increased debt service expenses dilution to our existing stockholders or restrictive covenants which could limit our ability to pursue our strategic plans 

as of december 31 2019  we had 22 billion in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities compared to 25 billion as of december 31 2018  cash cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december 31 2019 decreased primarily as a result of purchases of property plant and equipment and operating expenditures associated with the initial ramp of certain series 6 manufacturing lines as of december 31 2019 and 2018  09 billion and 12 billion  respectively of our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries and was primarily based in us dollar euro and japanese yen denominated holdings 

we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed if certain international funds were needed for our operations in the united states we may be required to accrue and pay certain us and foreign taxes to repatriate such funds we maintain the intent and ability to permanently reinvest our accumulated earnings outside the united states with the exception of our subsidiaries in canada and germany in addition changes to foreign government banking regulations may restrict our ability to move funds among various jurisdictions under certain circumstances which could negatively impact our access to capital resulting in an adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources 

our systems business requires significant liquidity and is expected to continue to have significant liquidity requirements in the future the net amount of our project assets and related portion of deferred revenue which approximates our net capital investment in the development and construction of systems projects was 3248 million as of december 31 2019  solar power project development cycles which span the time between the identification of a site location and the commercial operation of a system vary substantially and can take many years to mature as a result of these long project cycles and strategic decisions to finance the development of certain projects using our working capital we may need to make significant upfront investments of resources in advance of the receipt of any cash from the sale of such projects delays in construction or in completing the sale of our systems projects that we are selffinancing may also impact our liquidity in certain circumstances we may need to finance construction costs exclusively using working capital if project financing becomes unavailable due to marketwide regional or other concerns 

from time to time we may develop projects in certain markets around the world where we may hold all or a significant portion of the equity in a project for several years given the duration of these investments and the currency risk relative to the us dollar in some of these markets we continue to explore local financing alternatives should these financing alternatives be unavailable or too cost prohibitive we could be exposed to significant currency risk and our liquidity could be adversely impacted 

additionally we may elect to retain an ownership interest in certain systems projects after they become operational if we determine it would be of economic and strategic benefit to do so if for example we cannot sell a systems project at economics that are attractive to us or potential customers are unwilling to assume the risks and rewards typical of 

pv solar power system ownership we may instead elect to temporarily own and operate such systems project until we can sell it on economically attractive terms the decision to retain ownership of a system impacts our liquidity depending upon the size and cost of the project as of december 31 2019  we had 4770 million of net pv solar power systems that had been placed in service primarily in international markets we have elected and may in the future elect to enter into temporary or longterm project financing to reduce the impact on our liquidity and working capital with regards to such projects and systems we may also consider entering into tax equity or other arrangements with respect to ownership interests in certain of our projects which could cause a portion of the economics of such projects to be realized over time 

the following additional considerations have impacted or may impact our liquidity in 2020 and beyond 

 

 

the settlement including such payment and release described above is subject to court approval if the court preliminarily approves the settlement members of the settlement class will be provided notice of and an opportunity to object to the settlement at a fairness hearing to be held by the court to determine whether the settlement should be finally approved and whether the proposed order and final judgment should be entered if the court approves the settlement and enters such order and final judgment and such judgment is no longer subject to further appeal or other review the settlement fund will be disbursed in accordance with a plan of allocation approved by the court and the release will be effective to all members of the settlement class 

 



liquidity once solar modules and bos parts are installed in a project they are classified as either project assets pv solar power systems or cost of sales depending on whether the project is subject to a definitive sales contract and whether other revenue recognition criteria have been met we also produce significant volumes of modules for sale directly to thirdparties which requires us to carry inventories at levels sufficient to satisfy the demand of our customers and the needs of their projects which may also temporarily reduce our liquidity 

 

 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes key cash flow activity for the years ended december 31 2019  2018  and 2017 in thousands 



operating activities 

the increase in net cash provided by operating activities during 2019 was primarily driven by higher cash proceeds from sales of systems projects including the sunshine valley sun streams and california flats projects and advance payments received for sales of solar modules prior to the step down in the us investment tax credit as discussed above these increases were partially offset by operating expenditures associated with initial ramp of certain series 6 manufacturing lines and expenditures for the construction of certain projects 

investing activities 

the decrease in net cash used in investing activities during 2019 was primarily due to higher net sales of marketable securities and restricted investments partially offset by proceeds associated with the sale of our interests in 8point3 and its subsidiaries in 2018  

financing activities 

the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities during 2019 was primarily the result of lower net proceeds from borrowings under project specific debt financings associated with the construction of certain projects in australia japan and india 

contractual obligations 

the following table presents the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of december 31 2019 in thousands

we have excluded 722 million of unrecognized tax benefits from the amounts presented above as the timing of such obligations is uncertain 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2019  we had no offbalance sheet debt or similar obligations other than financial assurance related instruments and operating leases which are not classified as debt we do not guarantee any thirdparty debt see note 14 “commitments and contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements for further information about our financial assurance related instruments 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 3 “recent accounting pronouncements” to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of recent accounting pronouncements 

critical accounting estimates 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “us gaap” we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of reported assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment in the selection of the appropriate assumptions for making these estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty we base our judgments and estimates on our historical experience our forecasts and other available information as appropriate the actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results our future results of operations will be affected our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements the accounting policies that require the most significant judgment and estimates include the following 

revenue recognition – solar power system sales andor epc services  we generally recognize revenue for sales of solar power systems andor epc services over time as our performance creates or enhances an energy generation asset controlled by the customer furthermore the sale of a solar power system combined with epc services represents a single performance obligation for the development and construction of a single generation asset for such arrangements we recognize revenue and gross profit as work is performed using cost based input methods through which we determine our progress toward contract completion based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs including solar module costs of the contract  such revenue recognition is also dependent in part on our customers’ commitment to perform their obligations under the contract which is typically measured through the receipt of cash deposits or other forms of financial security issued by creditworthy financial institutions or parent entities for sales of solar power systems in which we obtain an interest in the project sold to the customer we recognize all of the revenue for the consideration received including the fair value of the noncontrolling interest we obtained and defer any profit associated with the interest obtained through “ equity in earnings net of tax ” we may also recognize revenue for the sale of a solar power system after it has been completed due to the timing of when we enter into the associated sales contract with the customer 

estimating the fair value of a noncontrolling interest we obtain begins with the valuation of the entire solar project ie solar power system being sold to the customer such valuation generally uses an income based valuation technique in which relevant cash flows are discounted to estimate the expected economic earnings capacity of the project typical factors considered in a project’s valuation include expected energy generation the duration and pricing of the ppa the pricing of energy to be sold on an open contract basis following the termination of the ppa ie merchant pricing curves other offtake agreements the useful life of the system tax attributes such as accelerated depreciation and tax credits sales of renewable energy certificates interconnection rights operating agreements and the cost of capital once the overall project valuation is agreed upon with the customer we determine the relative value related to our specific ownership interests conveyed through the transaction agreements including the membership interest purchase and sale agreement and the limited liability company agreement or equivalent of the project or its holding company 

cost based input methods of revenue recognition are considered a faithful depiction of our efforts to satisfy longterm construction contracts and therefore reflect the transfer of goods to a customer under such contracts costs incurred that do not contribute to satisfying our performance obligations “inefficient costs” are excluded from our input methods of revenue recognition as the amounts are not reflective of our transferring control of the system to the customer costs incurred toward contract completion may include costs associated with solar modules direct materials labor subcontractors and other indirect costs related to contract performance we recognize solar module and direct material costs as incurred when such items have been installed in a system 

cost based input methods of revenue recognition require us to make estimates of net contract revenues and costs to complete our projects in making such estimates significant judgment is required to evaluate assumptions related to the amount of net contract revenues including the impact of any performance incentives liquidated damages and other payments to customers significant judgment is also required to evaluate assumptions related to the costs to complete our projects including materials labor contingencies and other system costs if the estimated total costs on any contract 

including any inefficient costs are greater than the net contract revenues we recognize the entire estimated loss in the period the loss becomes known the cumulative effect of revisions to estimates related to net contract revenues or costs to complete contracts are recorded in the period in which the revisions to estimates are identified and the amounts can be reasonably estimated the effect of the changes on future periods are recognized as if the revised estimates had been used since revenue was initially recognized under the contract such revisions could occur in any reporting period and the effects may be material depending on the size of the contracts or the changes in estimates 

as part of our solar power system sales we conduct performance testing of a system prior to substantial completion to confirm the system meets its operational and capacity expectations noted in the epc agreement in addition we may provide an energy performance test during the first or second year of a system’s operation to demonstrate that the actual energy generation for the applicable period meets or exceeds the modeled energy expectation after certain adjustments these tests are based on meteorological energy and equipment performance data measured at the system’s location as well as certain projections of such data over the remaining measurement period in certain instances a bonus payment may be received at the end of the applicable test period if the system performs above a specified level conversely if there is an underperformance event with regards to these tests we may incur liquidated damages as a percentage of the epc contract price such performance guarantees represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data becomes available and only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of any incremental revenue will not occur 

revenue recognition – operations and maintenance we recognize revenue for standard recurring om services over time as customers receive and consume the benefits of such services costs of om services are expensed in the period in which they are incurred as part of our om service offerings we typically offer an effective availability guarantee which stipulates that a system will be available to generate a certain percentage of total possible energy during a specific period after adjusting for factors outside our control as the service provider these tests are based on meteorological energy and equipment performance data measured at the system’s location as well as certain projections of such data over the remaining measurement period if system availability exceeds a contractual threshold we may receive a bonus payment or if system availability falls below a separate threshold we may incur liquidated damages for certain lost energy under the ppa such bonuses or liquidated damages represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated and recognized over time as customers receive and consume the benefits of the om services 

accrued solar module collection and recycling liability when applicable we recognize expense at the time of sale for the estimated cost of our obligations to collect and recycle solar modules covered by our solar module collection and recycling program we estimate the cost of our collection and recycling obligations based on the present value of the expected probabilityweighted future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules which includes estimates for the cost of packaging materials the cost of freight from the solar module installation sites to a recycling center material labor and capital costs the scale of recycling centers and an estimated thirdparty profit margin and return on risk for collection and recycling services we base these estimates on i our experience collecting and recycling our solar modules ii the expected timing of when our solar modules will be returned for recycling and iii the expected economic factors at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled in the periods between the time of sale and the related settlement of the collection and recycling obligation we accrete the carrying amount of the associated liability by applying the discount rate used for its initial measurement we periodically review our estimates of expected future recycling costs and may adjust our liability accordingly 

product warranties we provide a limited pv solar module warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for approximately 10 years we also typically warrant that modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 98 of their labeled power output rating during the first year with the warranty coverage reducing by 05 every year thereafter throughout the approximate 25 year limited power output warranty period 

as an alternative form of our standard limited module power output warranty we also offer an aggregated or systemlevel limited module performance warranty this systemlevel limited module performance warranty is designed for 

utilityscale systems and provides 25 year systemlevel energy degradation protection this warranty represents a practical expedient to address the challenge of identifying from the potential millions of modules installed in a utilityscale system individual modules that may be performing below warranty thresholds by focusing on the aggregate energy generated by the system rather than the power output of individual modules the systemlevel limited module performance warranty is typically calculated as a percentage of a system’s expected energy production adjusted for certain actual site conditions with the warranted level of performance declining each year in a linear fashion but never falling below 80 during the term of the warranty 

in addition to our limited solar module warranties described above for pv solar power systems we construct we typically provide limited warranties for defects in engineering design installation and bos part workmanship for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a system or a block within the system 

when we recognize revenue for module or system sales we accrue liabilities for the estimated future costs of meeting our limited warranty obligations we make and revise these estimates based primarily on the number of our solar modules under warranty installed at customer locations our historical experience with and projections of warranty claims and our estimated permodule replacement costs we also monitor our expected future module performance through certain quality and reliability testing and actual performance in certain field installation sites in general we expect the return rates for our newer series of module technology to be lower than our older series we estimate that the return rate for such newer series of module technology will be less than 1  

income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the united states its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations such tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant taxing authorities we make judgments and interpretations regarding the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining our provision for income taxes and also make estimates about when in the future certain items are expected to affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions disputes over interpretations of tax laws may be settled with the relevant taxing authority upon examination or audit we regularly evaluate the likelihood of assessments in each of our taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and future examinations and we record tax liabilities as appropriate 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements we calculate our income tax provision based on our interpretation of the tax laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business this requires us to estimate our current tax obligations assess uncertain tax positions and assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities we must also assess the likelihood that each of our deferred tax assets will be realized to the extent we believe that realization of any of our deferred tax assets is not more likely than not we establish a valuation allowance when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a reporting period we generally record a corresponding tax expense conversely to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed which generally reduces our overall income tax expense 

we establish liabilities for potential additional taxes based on our assessment of the outcome of our tax positions once established we adjust these liabilities when additional information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring an adjustment significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the actual cost of a tax assessment fine or penalty may ultimately be materially different from our recorded liabilities if any 

we continually explore initiatives to better align our tax and legal entity structure with the footprint of our global operations and recognize the tax impact of these initiatives including changes in the assessment of uncertain tax positions indefinite reinvestment exception assertions and the realizability of deferred tax assets in the period when we believe all necessary internal and external approvals associated with such initiatives have been obtained or when the initiatives are materially complete 

asset impairments we assess longlived assets classified as “held and used” including our property plant and equipment project assets pv solar power systems and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances arise including consideration of technological obsolescence that may indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable and these assessments require significant judgment in determining whether such events or changes have occurred relevant considerations may include a significant decrease in the market price of a longlived asset a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset is being used or in its physical condition a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of a longlived asset an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a longlived asset a currentperiod operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of such losses or a projection of future losses associated with the use of a longlived asset or a current expectation that more likely than not a longlived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss longlived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and we must also exercise judgment in assessing such groupings and levels 

when impairment indicators are present we compare undiscounted future cash flows including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value to the asset group’s carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset group to its carrying value fair value is generally determined by considering i internally developed discounted cash flows for the asset group ii thirdparty valuations andor iii information available regarding the current market value for such assets if the fair value of an asset group is determined to be less than its carrying value an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and such projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency exchange risk 

cash flow exposure we expect certain of our subsidiaries to have future cash flows that will be denominated in currencies other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies changes in the exchange rates between the functional currencies of our subsidiaries and the other currencies in which they transact will cause fluctuations in the cash flows we expect to receive or pay when these cash flows are realized or settled accordingly we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of these forecasted cash flows these foreign exchange forward contracts qualify for accounting as cash flow hedges in accordance with asc 815 and we designated them as such we initially report the effective portion of a derivative’s unrealized gain or loss in “ accumulated other comprehensive loss ” and subsequently reclassify amounts into earnings when the hedged transaction occurs and impacts earnings for additional details on our derivative hedging instruments and activities see note 9 “derivative financial instruments” to our consolidated financial statements 

certain of our international operations such as our manufacturing facilities in malaysia and vietnam pay a portion of their operating expenses including associate wages and utilities in local currencies which exposes us to foreign currency exchange risk for such expenses our manufacturing facilities are also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk for purchases of certain equipment from international vendors as we expand into new markets worldwide particularly emerging markets our total foreign currency exchange risk in terms of both size and exchange rate volatility and the number of foreign currencies we are exposed to could increase significantly 

for the year ended december 31 2019  8 of our net sales were denominated in foreign currencies including australian dollar and euro  as a result we have exposure to foreign currencies with respect to our net sales which has historically represented one of our primary foreign currency exchange risks a 10 change in the us dollar to australian dollar and us dollar to euro exchange rates would have had an aggregate impact on our net sales of 180 million  excluding the effect of our hedging activities 

transaction exposure many of our subsidiaries have assets and liabilities primarily cash receivables marketable securities deferred taxes payables accrued expenses and solar module collection and recycling liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies changes in the exchange rates between the functional currencies of our subsidiaries and the other currencies in which these assets and liabilities are denominated will create fluctuations in our reported consolidated statements of operations and cash flows we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other financial instruments to economically hedge assets and liabilities against the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations the gains and losses on such foreign exchange forward contracts will economically offset all or part of the transaction gains and losses that we recognize in earnings on the related foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities for additional details on our economic hedging instruments and activities see note 9 “derivative financial instruments” to our consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2019  a 10 change in the us dollar relative to our primary foreign currency exposures would not have had a significant impact to our net foreign currency income or loss including the effect of our hedging activities 

interest rate risk 

variable rate debt exposure we are exposed to interest rate risk as certain of our project specific debt financings have variable interest rates exposing us to variability in interest expense and cash flows see note 13 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our longterm debt borrowing rates an increase in relevant interest rates would increase the cost of borrowing under certain of our project specific debt financings if such variable interest rates changed by 100 basis points our interest expense for the year ended december 31 2019 would have changed by 11 million  including the effect of our hedging activities 

customer financing exposure we are also indirectly exposed to interest rate risk because many of our customers depend on debt financings to purchase modules or systems an increase in interest rates could make it challenging for our customers to obtain the capital necessary to make such purchases on favorable terms or at all such factors could reduce demand or lower the price we can charge for our modules and systems thereby reducing our net sales and gross profit in addition we believe that a significant percentage of our customers purchase systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt an increase in interest rates could lower an investor’s return on investment in a system or make alternative investments more attractive relative to pv solar power systems which in either case could cause these endusers to seek alternative investments with higher riskadjusted returns 

marketable securities and restricted investments exposure we invest in various debt securities which exposes us to interest rate risk the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal and provide liquidity while at the same time maximizing the return on our investments many of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk accordingly a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the market value of such investments to fluctuate for example if we hold a security that was issued with an interest rate fixed at the thenprevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate subsequently rises the market value of our investment may decline 

for the year ended december 31 2019  our marketable securities earned a return of 3  including the impact of fluctuations in the price of the underlying securities and had a weightedaverage maturity of 5 months as of the end of the period based on our investment positions as of december 31 2019  a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would have resulted in a 32 million change in the market value of our investment portfolio for the year ended december 31 2019  our restricted investments earned a return of 12  including the impact of fluctuations in the price of the underlying securities and had a weightedaverage maturity of approximately 16 years as of the end of the period based on our restricted investment positions as of december 31 2019  a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would have resulted in a 361 million change in the market value of our restricted investment portfolio 

commodity and component risk 

we are exposed to price risks for the raw materials components services and energy costs used in the manufacturing and transportation of our solar modules and bos parts used in our systems also some of our raw materials and components are sourced from a limited number of suppliers or a single supplier we endeavor to qualify multiple suppliers using a robust qualification process in some cases we also enter into longterm supply contracts for raw materials and components accordingly we are exposed to price changes in the raw materials and components used in our solar modules and systems in addition the failure of a key supplier could disrupt our supply chain which could result in higher prices andor a disruption in our manufacturing or construction processes we may be unable to pass along changes in the costs of the raw materials and components for our modules and systems to our customers and may be in default of our delivery obligations if we experience a manufacturing or construction disruption 

credit risk 

we have certain financial and derivative instruments that subject us to credit risk these consist primarily of cash cash equivalents marketable securities accounts receivable restricted cash and investments notes receivable and foreign exchange forward contracts we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial and derivative instruments we place cash cash equivalents marketable securities restricted cash and investments and foreign exchange forward contracts with various highquality financial institutions and limit the amount of credit risk from any one counterparty we continuously evaluate the credit standing of our counterparty financial institutions we monitor the financial condition of our customers and perform credit evaluations whenever considered necessary depending upon the sales arrangement we may require some form of payment security from our customers including advance payments parent guarantees bank guarantees surety bonds or commercial letters of credit we also have ppas that subject us to credit risk in the event our offtake counterparties are unable to fulfill their contractual obligations which may adversely affect our project assets and certain receivables accordingly we closely monitor the credit standing of existing and potential offtake counterparties to limit such risks

 item 1  business 

company overview 

we are a leading global provider of comprehensive pv solar energy solutions we design manufacture and sell pv solar modules with an advanced thin film semiconductor technology and also develop design construct and sell pv solar power systems that primarily use the modules we manufacture additionally we provide operations and maintenance “om” services to system owners we have substantial ongoing rd efforts focused on module and systemlevel innovations we are the world’s largest thin film pv solar module manufacturer and one of the world’s largest pv solar module manufacturers 

in addressing the overall global demand for electricity our highefficiency cdte modules led by our series 6 module technology and fully integrated systems provide competitively priced utilityscale pv solar energy solutions which compete on an economic basis in many climates with traditional forms of energy generation and provide low cost electricity to endusers our verticallyintegrated capabilities enable us to provide such solutions accelerate the adoption of our technology and successfully sell into key markets around the world we seek to offer leadership across the entire solar value chain resulting in more reliable and cost effective energy solutions for our customers 

business strategy 

we believe the following strategies and points of differentiation provide the foundation for our leading industry position and enable us to remain one of the preferred providers of pv solar energy solutions 

differentiated technology 

as a fieldproven technology our cdte solar modules offer certain advantages over conventional crystalline silicon based solar modules by delivering competitive efficiency higher realworld energy yield and longterm reliability proven to deliver up to 8  more usable energy per nameplate watt than conventional technologies in certain geographic markets and with a record of reliable system performance our cdte technology delivers more energy more consistently over the lifetime of a pv solar power system our series 6 module technology with its combination of high wattage low manufacturing costs a larger form factor and balance of systems “bos” component compatibility has further enhanced our competitive position since the launch of such technology in 2018 we expect our continued transition to series 6 module technology to enable us to maximize the intrinsic cost advantage of cdte thin film technology versus crystalline silicon 

in terms of energy yield in many climates our cdte solar modules provide a significant energy production advantage over most crystalline silicon solar modules of equivalent efficiency rating for example our cdte solar modules provide a superior temperature coefficient which results in stronger system performance in typical high insolation climates as the majority of a system’s generation on average occurs when module temperatures are well above 25°c standard test conditions in addition our cdte solar modules provide a superior spectral response in humid environments where atmospheric moisture alters the solar spectrum relative to laboratory standards our cdte solar modules also provide a better shading response than conventional crystalline silicon solar modules which may lose up to three times as much power as cdte solar modules when shading occurs as a result of these factors our pv solar power systems typically produce more annual energy in real world field conditions than conventional systems with the same nameplate capacity 

manufacturing process 

our modules are manufactured in a highthroughput automated environment that integrates all manufacturing steps into a continuous flow line such manufacturing process eliminates the multiple supply chain operators and expensive and timeconsuming batch processing steps that are used to produce crystalline silicon solar modules at the outset of 

 3 

the production of our modules a sheet of glass enters the production line and in less than 35  hours is transformed into a completed module which is flash tested packaged and ready for shipment with more than 20  gw dc  of modules sold worldwide we have a demonstrated history of manufacturing success and innovation we have a global manufacturing footprint with facilities based in perrysburg ohio kulim malaysia and ho chi minh city vietnam 

as we continue to transition our manufacturing capacity to series 6 module technology we expect to ramp down substantially all production of our series 4 tm  “series 4” modules in 2019 although this transition process has resulted in a temporary reduction in production capacity the process has allowed us to use our existing manufacturing infrastructure to more quickly and cost effectively deploy our series 6 module technology to best position us for longterm competitiveness and growth 

vertical integration 

we are vertically integrated across substantially the entire solar value chain many of the efficiencies cost reductions and capabilities that we deliver to our customers are not easily replicable for other industry participants that are not vertically integrated in a similar manner accordingly our operational model offers pv solar energy solutions that benefit from our wide range of capabilities including advanced pv solar module manufacturing project development engineering and plant optimization grid integration and plant control systems procurement and construction services and om services 

financial viability 

we are committed to creating longterm shareholder value through a decisionmaking framework that delivers a balance of growth profitability and liquidity this framework has enabled us to fund our series 6 transition and capacity expansion initiatives using cash flows generated by our operations despite substantial downward pressure on the price of solar modules and systems due to pricing competition demand fluctuations and significant overcapacity in the industry our financial viability provides strategic optionality as we evaluate how to invest in our business and generate returns for our shareholders our financial viability and bankability also enable us to offer meaningful module and system warranties after installation which provide us with a competitive advantage relative to some of our peers in the solar industry in the context of project financing and offering pv solar energy solutions to longterm owners furthermore we expect our financial discipline and ability to manage operating costs to enhance our profitability as we continue to scale our business 

sustainability 

in addition to our financial commitments we are also committed to minimizing the environmental impacts and enhancing the social and economic benefits of our products across their life cycle from raw material sourcing through endoflife module recycling accordingly our modules and systems provide an ecologically leading solution to climate change energy security and water scarcity which also enables our customers to achieve their sustainability objectives on a lifecycle basis our thin film module technology has the smallest carbon footprint fastest energy payback time and lowest water use of any pv solar technology on the market 

as a result of our specialized manufacturing process the carbon footprint of our modules is up to six times lower than conventional crystalline silicon modules and a fraction of the carbon footprint of conventional energy sources furthermore our technology displaces up to 98  of greenhouse gas emissions and other air pollutants when replacing traditional forms of energy generation our manufacturing process also facilitates the fastest energy payback time which is the amount of time a system must operate to recover the energy required to produce it of all pv solar technologies in less than six months under high irradiance conditions our systems produce more energy than was required to create them which represents a 50fold energy return on investment over a 25year system lifetime and an abundant net energy gain to the electricity grid our modules also use up to 400  times less water per mw hour than conventional energy and up to 24  times less water than other pv solar technologies in addition our industryleading 

 4 

recycling process further enhances our sustainability advantage by recovering approximately 90  of the glass for reuse in new glass products and over 90  of the semiconductor material for reuse in new modules 

offerings and capabilities 

we are focusing on markets and energy applications in which solar power can be a leastcost bestfit energy solution particularly in regions with high solar resources significant current or projected electricity demand andor relatively high existing electricity prices we differentiate our product offerings by geographic market and localize the solution as needed our consultative approach to our customers’ solar energy needs and capabilities results in customized solutions to meet their economic goals as a result we have designed our product and service offerings according to the following business areas

market overview 

solar energy is one of the fastest growing forms of renewable energy with numerous economic and environmental benefits that make it an attractive complement to andor substitute for traditional forms of energy generation in recent years the price of pv solar power systems and accordingly the cost of producing electricity from such systems has dropped to levels that are competitive with or even below the wholesale price of electricity in many markets this rapid price decline has opened new possibilities to develop systems in some locations with limited or no financial incentives other technological developments in the industry such as the development of storage capabilities have further enhanced the prospects of solar energy as a competitive alternative to traditional forms of energy generation furthermore the fact that a pv solar power system requires no fuel provides a unique and valuable hedging benefit to owners of such systems relative to traditional energy generation assets once installed pv solar power systems can function for 25 or more years with relatively less maintenance or oversight compared to many other forms of generation in addition to these economic benefits solar energy has substantial environmental benefits for example pv solar power systems generate no greenhouse gas or other emissions and use minimal amounts of water compared to traditional energy generation assets worldwide solar markets continue to develop aided by the above factors as well as demand elasticity resulting from declining industry average selling prices both at the module and system level which have made solar power one of the most economical sources of energy 

module average selling prices in global markets have experienced an accelerated decline in recent years and are expected to continue to decline to some degree in the future in the aggregate we believe manufacturers of solar cells and modules have significant installed production capacity relative to global demand and the ability for additional capacity expansion we believe the solar industry may from time to time experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity exceeds global demand and that such periods will continue to put pressure on pricing we believe the solar industry is currently in such a period due in part to recent developments in china which include feedintariff reductions causing deferment of incountry project development additionally intense competition at the system level may result in an environment in which pricing falls rapidly thereby further increasing demand for solar energy solutions but constraining the ability for project developers epc companies and verticallyintegrated companies such as first solar to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability in light of such market realities we are focusing on our strategies and points of differentiation which include our advanced module and system technologies our manufacturing process our verticallyintegrated business model our financial viability and the sustainability advantage of our modules and systems 

global markets 

we have established and are continuing to develop a global business presence energy markets are by their nature localized with different drivers and market forces impacting electricity generation and demand in a particular region or for a particular application accordingly our business is evolving worldwide and is shaped by the varying ways in which our pv solar energy solutions can be a compelling and economically viable solution to energy needs in different markets and applications the following markets represent the key markets for our pv solar modules and systems 

 6 

the americas 

united states  multiple markets within the united states which accounted for 66  of our 2018  net sales exemplify favorable characteristics for a solar market including i sizeable electricity demand particularly around growing population centers and industrial areas ii strong demand for renewable energy generation and iii abundant solar resources in those areas and applications in which these factors are more pronounced our pv solar energy solutions compete favorably on an economic basis with traditional forms of energy generation the market penetration of pv solar is also impacted by certain federal and state support programs including the current 30  federal investment tax credit as described under “support programs” we have significant experience and a market leadership position in developing engineering constructing and maintaining utilityscale power plants in the united states particularly in california and other southwestern states and increasingly in southeastern states currently our solar projects in the united states represent the majority of the advancedstage pipeline of projects that we are either currently constructing or expect to construct see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – systems project pipeline” for more information about these projects 

other americas outside the united states we have drawn on our industry expertise and module technology advantages to make inroads in certain central and south american markets accordingly we continue to pursue module sale opportunities in mexico and brazil while monitoring opportunities in other countries with high growth potential 

asiapacific 

australia  australia is a promising region for pv solar energy with strong growth expected to continue over the next several years in september 2018 we completed the sale of our 49 mw ac  manildra project located in new south wales and in july 2018 we executed definitive sale agreements for the sale of our 87 mw ac  beryl project also located in new south wales the region’s strong growth is being driven by several factors including an increased demand for ppas from australian commercial and industrial companies certain government programs and continued procurement from local utilities as well as the emergence of a merchant power market we continue to focus our efforts in the region on utilityscale project development including our selfdeveloped projects in queensland new south wales and victoria while increasing our om services and thirdparty module sales 

japan japan’s electricity markets have various characteristics which make them attractive markets for pv solar energy in particular japan has few domestic fossil fuel resources and relies heavily on fossil fuel imports following the fukushima earthquake in 2011 the country introduced certain initiatives to limit its reliance on nuclear power accordingly the japanese government announced a longterm goal of dramatically increasing installed solar power capacity and provided various incentives for solar power installations in recent years we have partnered with local companies to develop construct and operate pv solar power systems which will further mitigate japan’s dependence on fossil fuel imports and nuclear power in 2018 we completed the sale of multiple projects in japan totaling 62  mw ac  and expect to continue providing om services to such projects in the future separately we began operating a 59  mw ac  project in ishikawa prefecture and commenced construction of a 40  mw ac  project in miyagi prefecture we continue to pursue other utilityscale project development om and module sale opportunities in the region 

europe the middle east and india 

europe  many markets across europe reflect strong demand for pv solar energy due to its ability to compete economically with more traditional forms of energy generation in particular france germany greece the netherlands and spain are all running tenders in which utilityscale pv solar projects can bid for capacity such tenders and other recent market developments indicate the potential for further growth in the demand for pv solar energy beyond the region’s installed generation capacity of approximately 120 gw dc  we continue to pursue module sales activities in multiple countries such as france and turkey while working with certain local partners for the distribution of our modules 

 7 

the middle east  the market potential for solar energy in the middle east continues to be driven by a combination of strong economic fundamentals aggressive tariff pricing abundant solar resources and robust policy the united arab emirates the “uae” saudi arabia egypt and jordan have established utilityscale solar programs which are at varying degrees of maturity the uae and jordan lead the region with policy mechanisms designed to ramp up the amount of renewable energy in their generation portfolios oman qatar and kuwait are also promising markets with indicators of future potential for solar energy while there are several motives for investing in solar energy including energy security diversification of generation portfolios and the minimization of domestic consumption of hydrocarbons the common factor is that the economics of pv solar energy have made it a compelling energy generation source we have sold approximately 350 mw dc  of modules in the region and continue to pursue additional module sales opportunities 

india  india continues to represent one of the largest and fastest growing markets for pv solar energy with an installed generation capacity of nearly 25 gw dc  another 12 gw dc  of projects in development or construction and over 20 gw dc  of new procurement programs announced in addition the government has established aggressive renewable energy targets which include increasing the country’s solar capacity to 100 gw dc  by 2022 these targets along with various policy and regulatory measures help create significant and sustained demand for pv solar energy accordingly we expect to continue selling modules to local integrators and operators of systems to address the region’s energy needs in march 2018 we completed the sale of our winsol and hindupur projects located in andhra pradesh which total 155 mw ac  we also own and operate two additional projects located in karnataka totaling 40 mw ac  for which we have secured rights to sell power under separate 25year ppas to state owned electricity distribution companies in addition we continue to maintain our strong module presence in the region with approximately 2 gw dc  of installed modules 

support programs 

although we compete in many markets that do not require solarspecific government subsidies or support programs our net sales and profits remain subject in the near term to regulation and variability based on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives such as quotas renewable portfolio standards and tendering systems in addition to these support programs financial incentives for pv solar energy generation may include tax incentives grants loans rebates and production incentives although we expect to become less impacted by and less dependent on these forms of government support over time such programs will continue to play varying roles in accelerating the adoption of pv solar power systems around the world 

in europe renewable energy targets in conjunction with tenders for utilityscale pv solar and other support measures have contributed to the growth in pv solar markets renewable energy targets prescribe how much energy consumption must come from renewable sources while incentive policies and competitive tender policies are intended to support new supply development by providing certainty to investors various european union “eu” directives on renewable energy have set targets for all eu member states in support of the goal of a 32  share of energy from renewable sources in the eu by 2030  

tax incentive programs exist in the united states at both the federal and state level and can take the form of investment and production tax credits accelerated depreciation and sales and property tax exemptions and abatements at the federal level investment tax credits for business and residential solar systems have gone through several cycles of enactment and expiration since the 1980s in 2015 the us congress extended the 30  federal energy investment tax credit “itc” for both residential and commercial solar installations through 2019 in february 2018 the bipartisan budget act of 2018 modified the itc by replacing the requirement to place solar projects in service by a certain date with a requirement to begin construction by a certain date in june 2018 the internal revenue service “irs” released new guidance to determine when construction has begun on a solar project accordingly projects that commence construction in 2019 will be eligible for the 30  itc the credit will step down to 26  for projects that commence construction in 2020 22  for projects that commence construction in 2021 and 10  for projects that commence construction thereafter the itc has been an important economic driver of solar installations in the united states and its extension has contributed to greater mediumterm demand visibility the positive impact of the itc depends to a 

 8 

large degree on the availability of tax equity for project financing and any significant reduction in the availability of tax equity in the future could make it more difficult to develop and construct projects requiring financing the eventual stepdown of the itc to 10  underscores the need for the levelized cost of electricity “lcoe” meaning the net present value of a system’s total life cycle costs divided by the quantity of energy that is expected to be produced over the system’s life of solar systems to continue to remain competitive with other sources of energy generation 

in october 2017 the united states environmental protection agency “us epa” issued a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing to repeal the previous us presidential administration’s clean power plan which established standards to limit carbon dioxide emissions from existing power generation facilities in august 2018 the us epa proposed the affordable clean energy “ace” rule which would establish emission guidelines for states to develop plans to address greenhouse gas emissions from existing coalfired power plants the ace rule would replace the clean power plan which the us epa has proposed to repeal accordingly there is significant uncertainty regarding what effects if any the ace rule may have on pv solar markets 

the majority of states in the united states have also enacted legislation adopting renewable portfolio standard “rps” mechanisms under a rps regulated utilities and other load serving entities are required to procure a specified percentage of their total retail electricity sales to enduser customers from eligible renewable resources such as solar energy generation facilities by a specified date some programs may further require that a specified portion of the total percentage of renewable energy must come from solar generation facilities or other technologies rps legislation and implementing regulations vary significantly from state to state particularly with respect to the percentage of renewable energy required to achieve the state’s rps the definition of eligible renewable energy resources and the extent to which renewable energy credits certificates representing the generation of renewable energy qualify for rps compliance 

measured in terms of the volume of renewable electricity required to meet its rps mandate california’s rps program is the most significant in the united states and the california market for renewable energy has dominated the western united states region for the past several years first enacted in 2002  california’s rps statute has been amended several times to increase the overall percentage requirement as well as to accelerate the target date for program compliance pursuant to amendments enacted by the california legislature in 2015  the california rps program now requires utilities and other obligated load serving entities to procure 50  of their total retail electricity demand from eligible renewable resources by 2030  in 2018  approximately 38  of our total net sales were derived from module and system sales in california 

various proposed and contemplated environmental and tax policies may create regulatory uncertainty in the renewable energy sector including the solar energy sector and may lead to a reduction or removal of various clean energy programs and initiatives designed to curtail climate change for more information about the risks associated with these potential government actions see item 1a “risk factors – the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives tax incentives renewable energy targets and other support for ongrid solar electricity applications or other adverse public policies such as tariffs or other trade remedies imposed on solar cells and modules could negatively impact demand andor price levels for our solar modules and systems and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales thereby adversely impacting our operating results ”

modules business 

solar modules 

since the inception of first solar our flagship module has been manufactured using our advanced cdte thin film technology each series 6 module the latest generation of our flagship module is a glass laminate approximately 4ft x 6ft 123cm x 201cm in size that encapsulates thin film semiconductor materials and our legacy series 4 module is approximately 2ft x 4ft 60cm x 120cm in size with similar technology and materials in april 2018 we commenced commercial production of our series 6 modules which have an average rated power per module of approximately 420 watts our legacy series 4 modules had an average rated power per module of approximately 119 watts  118 watts  and 114 watts  for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively our modules offer up to 8  more energy than conventional crystalline silicon modules of equivalent efficiency rating and generally include antireflective coated glass which further enhances energy production our module semiconductor structure is a singlejunction polycrystalline thin film that uses cdte as the absorption layer cdte has absorption properties that are well matched to the solar spectrum and can deliver competitive conversion efficiencies using approximately 12 of the amount of semiconductor material that is used to manufacture conventional crystalline silicon modules 

manufacturing process 

we manufacture our cdte solar modules on integrated production lines in an automated proprietary and continuous process our solar modules employ a thin layer of semiconductor material to convert sunlight into electricity our manufacturing process eliminates the multiple supply chain operators and expensive and timeconsuming batch processing steps that are used to produce crystalline silicon solar modules we currently manufacture solar modules at our perrysburg ohio kulim malaysia and ho chi minh city vietnam manufacturing facilities 

our cdte manufacturing process includes the following three stages i the deposition stage ii the cell definition and treatment stage and iii the assembly and test stage in the deposition stage panels of transparent oxidecoated glass are robotically loaded onto the production line where they are cleaned lasermark identified with a serial number heated and coated with thin layers of cdte and other semiconductor materials using our proprietary vapor transport deposition technology after which the semiconductorcoated plates are cooled rapidly to increase glass strength in the cell definition and treatment stage we use highspeed lasers to transform the large continuous semiconductor coating on the glass plate into a series of interconnected cells that deliver the desired current and voltage output in this stage we also treat the semiconductor film using proprietary chemistries and processes to improve the device’s performance and we apply a metal sputtered back contact in the assembly and test stage we apply busbars interlayer material and a rear glass cover sheet that is laminated to encapsulate the device we then apply antireflective coating material to the substrate glass to further improve the module’s performance by increasing its ability to absorb sunlight finally junction boxes termination wires and an undermount frame for series 6 modules are applied to complete the assembly 

we maintain a robust quality and reliability assurance program that monitors critical process parameters and measures product performance to ensure that industry and more stringent internal standards are met acceptance testing for electrical leakage visual quality and power measurement on a solar simulator are also conducted prior to preparing a module for shipment the quality and reliability tests complement production surveillance with an ongoing monitoring program subjecting production modules to accelerated life stress testing to help ensure ongoing conformance to requirements of the international electrotechnical commission and underwriters laboratories inc these programs help assure delivery of power and performance in the field with a high level of product quality and reliability

research and development 

our rd model differentiates us from much of our competition due to its vertical integration from advanced research to product development manufacturing and applications we continue to devote substantial resources to our rd efforts which generally focus on continually improving the wattage and energy yield of our solar modules we also focus our rd activities on continuously improving module durability and manufacturing efficiencies including throughput improvement volume ramp and material cost reduction based on publicly available information we are one of the leaders in rd investment among pv solar module manufacturers maintaining a rate of innovation that enables rapid wattage gains and cost reductions 

in the course of our rd activities we explore various technologies in our efforts to sustain competitive differentiation in our modules we primarily conduct our rd activities and qualify process and product improvements for full production at our perrysburg ohio plant and then use a systematic process to propagate them to our other production lines we believe that our systematic approach to technology change management provides continuous improvements and ensures uniform adoption across our production lines in addition our respective series 6 and series 4 production lines are replicas or near replicas of each other and as a result a process or production improvement on one line can be rapidly and reliably deployed to other production lines 

we regularly produce research cells in our laboratories some of which are tested for performance and certified by independent labs such as the national renewable energy laboratory cell efficiency measures the proportion of light converted to electricity in a single solar cell at standard test conditions our research cells are produced using laboratory equipment and methods and are not intended to be representative of our manufacturing capability our module conversion efficiency has improved on average more than half a percent every year for the last ten years we currently hold two world records for cdte pv efficiency achieving an independently certified research cell efficiency of 221  and a full aperture area module efficiency of 186  we believe that our record cells demonstrate a potential longterm module efficiency entitlement of over 20  using our commercialscale manufacturing equipment 

customers 

during 2018  we sold the majority of our solar modules not included in our systems projects to integrators and operators of systems in the united states  australia  and france  and such thirdparty module sales represented approximately 22  of our total net sales during 2018  ma mortenson company  rcr odonnell griffin pty ltd  and tampa electric company  each accounted for more than 10  of our modules business net sales 

we continue to invest in key geographic markets particularly in areas with abundant solar resources and sizable electricity demand and additional customer relationships to diversify our customer base we also collaborate with strategic partners in community solar solutions which address the residential and small business sectors to provide a broad range of customers with access to competitively priced solar energy regardless of the suitability of their rooftops community solar utilizes relatively small groundmounted installations that provide clean energy to utilities which then offer consumers the ability to buy into a specific community installation and benefit from the solar power generated by that resource the demand for such offerings continues to build as states across the country are enacting community solar policies and utilities are looking to diversify their energy generation portfolio in order to meet customer demand for affordable clean energy we also collaborate with providers of community choice aggregation programs which allow cities and counties to purchase power on behalf of residents and businesses to provide clean energy options at competitive prices our expertise in module technology and utilityscale generation paired with community solar andor community choice aggregation allows residential power consumers to “go solar” including those who live in apartment buildings or whose home rooftops cannot accommodate solar panels 

competition 

the solar energy and renewable energy sectors are highly competitive and continually evolving as participants in these sectors strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete within the larger electric power industry we 

 11 

face intense competition for sales of solar modules which has resulted in and may continue to result in reduced average selling prices and loss of market share with respect to our modules business our primary sources of competition are crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers in addition we expect to compete with future entrants into the pv solar industry that offer new or differentiated technological solutions we also face competition from semiconductor manufacturers and semiconductor equipment manufacturers or their customers that produce pv solar cells solar modules or turnkey production lines within the larger electric power industry we also compete with companies that currently offer or are developing other renewable energy technologies including wind hydroelectric geothermal biomass and tidal technologies as well as traditional energy generation sources 

certain of our existing or future competitors may have direct or indirect access to sovereign capital which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time among pv solar module manufacturers the principal methods of competition include sales price per watt conversion efficiency energy yield reliability warranty terms and customer payment terms if competitors reduce module pricing to levels near or below their manufacturing costs or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time our results of operations could be adversely affected we believe the solar industry may from time to time experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity exceeds global demand and that such periods will put pressure on pricing which could adversely affect our results of operations we believe the solar industry is currently in such a period due in part to recent developments in china which include feedintariff reductions causing deferment of incountry project development for additional information see item 1a “risk factors – competition in solar markets globally and across the solar value chain is intense and could remain that way for an extended period of time an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may continue to cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations ”

our cdte module manufacturing process uses approximately 30 types of raw materials and components to construct a solar module one critical raw material in our production process is cdte of the other raw materials and components the following are also critical to our manufacturing process front glass coated with transparent conductive oxide other semiconductor materials organics such as photo resist tempered back glass frames packaging components such as interlayer cord platecord plate cap lead wire and solar connectors before we use these materials and components in our manufacturing process a supplier must undergo rigorous qualification procedures and we continually evaluate new suppliers as part of our cost reduction roadmaps when possible we attempt to use suppliers that can provide a raw material supply source that is near our manufacturing locations reducing the cost and lead times for such materials several of our key raw materials and components are either singlesourced or sourced from a limited number of suppliers 

solar module collection and recycling 

we are committed to extended producer responsibility and take into account the environmental impact of our products over their entire life cycle as part of such efforts we previously established the solar industry’s first comprehensive module collection and recycling program our module recycling process is designed to enable the recovery of valuable materials including the glass and encapsulated semiconductor material for use in new modules or other products and minimizes the environmental impacts associated with our modules at the end of their useful lives approximately 90  of each collected first solar module can be recycled into materials for reuse for legacy customer sales contracts that were covered under this program we agreed to pay the costs for the collection and recycling of qualifying solar modules and the endusers agreed to notify us disassemble their solar power systems package the solar modules for shipment and revert ownership rights over the modules back to us at the end of the modules’ service lives we currently have recycling facilities operating at each of our manufacturing facilities in the united states malaysia and vietnam and at our former manufacturing facility location in germany 

the eu’s waste electronics and electrical equipment “weee” directive places the obligation of recycling including collection treatment and environmentally sound disposal of electrical and electronic equipment products upon 

 12 

producers and such directive is applicable to pv solar modules in eu member states for modules covered under our program that were previously sold into and installed in the eu we continue to maintain a commitment to cover the estimated collection and recycling costs consistent with our historical program additionally as a result of the transposition of the weee directive by the eu member states we have adjusted our offerings as required in various eu member states to ensure compliance with specific eu member state weee regulations 

solar module warranties 

we provide a limited pv solar module warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for approximately 10  years we also typically warrant that modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 98  of their labeled power output rating during the first year with the warranty coverage reducing by 05  every year thereafter throughout the approximate 25 year limited power output warranty period as an alternative form of our standard limited module power output warranty we also offer to certain customers an aggregated or systemlevel limited module performance warranty this systemlevel limited module performance warranty is designed for utilityscale systems and provides 25 year systemlevel energy degradation protection for additional information on our solar module warranty programs refer to item 1a “risk factors – problems with product quality or performance including our series 4 modules and series 6 modules may cause us to incur significant andor unexpected contractual damages andor warranty and related expenses damage our market reputation and prevent us from maintaining or increasing our market share ” 

systems business 

project development 

project development activities generally include i site selection and securing rights to acquire or use the site ii obtaining the requisite interconnection and transmission studies iii executing an interconnection agreement iv obtaining environmental and landuse permits v maintaining effective site control and vi entering into a ppa with an offtaker of the power to be generated by the project the sequence of such development activities varies by international location and in certain locations may begin by initially bidding for ppa or offtake agreements these activities culminate in receiving the right to construct and operate a pv solar power system 

depending on the market opportunity or geographic location we may acquire projects in various stages of development or acquire project companies from developers in order to complete the development process construct a system incorporating our modules and sell the system to a longterm owner we may also collaborate with local partners in connection with these project development activities depending on the type of project or geographic location ppas or fit structures define the price and terms the utility or customer will pay for power produced from the project depending primarily on the location stage of development upon our acquisition of the project andor other site attributes the development cycle typically ranges from one to two years but may be as long as five years we may be required to incur significant costs for preliminary engineering permitting legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built if there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals we may be forced to incur additional costs or impair our project assets and the termination rights of the offtaker under the ppa may be triggered 

epc services 

epc services include engineering design and related services bos procurement advanced development of grid integration solutions and construction contracting and management depending on the customer and market need we may provide our full epc services or any combination of individual products and services within our epc capabilities we conduct performance testing of a system prior to substantial completion to confirm the system meets its operational and capacity expectations noted in the epc agreement for pv solar power systems we construct we typically provide limited warranties for defects in engineering design installation and bos part workmanship for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a system or a block within the system we may also provide an energy 

 13 

performance test during the first or second year of a system’s operation to demonstrate that the actual energy generation for the applicable year meets or exceeds the modeled energy expectation after certain adjustments such as irradiance weather module degradation soiling curtailment and other conditions that may affect a system’s energy output but are unrelated to quality design or construction 

om services 

our typical om service arrangements involve the performance of standard activities associated with operating and maintaining a pv solar power system we perform such activities pursuant to the scope of services outlined in the underlying contract these activities are considered necessary to optimize system performance and comply with ppas other agreements and regulations although the scope of our services may vary by contract our om service arrangements generally include 247 system monitoring certain ppa and other agreement compliance nerc compliance large generator interconnection agreement compliance energy forecasting performance engineering analysis regular performance reporting turnkey maintenance services including spare parts and corrective maintenance repair warranty management and environmental services as part of our om services we also typically provide an effective availability guarantee which stipulates that a system will be available to generate a certain percentage of total possible energy during a specific period after adjusting for factors outside of our control as the service provider such as weather curtailment outages force majeure and other conditions that may affect system availability 

customers 

our systems customers consist of utilities independent power producers commercial and industrial companies and other system owners such as investors who are looking for longterm investment vehicles that are expected to generate consistent returns such customers may purchase completed systems which include our solar modules or any combination of development epc services andor om services during 2018  the substantial majority of our systems business sales were in the united states  japan  and india  and the principal customers of our systems business were tampa electric company  capital dynamics inc “ capital dynamics ” mitsui  co  de shaw  and idfc alternatives  who each accounted for more than 10  of our systems business net sales 

in certain markets the emergence of utilityowned generation has increased the number of potential project buyers as such utility customers benefit from a potentially low cost of capital available through ratebasing utility investments given their longterm ownership profile utilityowned generation customers typically seek to partner with verticallyintegrated companies such as first solar who can provide a broad spectrum of utilityscale generation solutions including reliable pv solar technology project development and construction and om services thereby mitigating their longterm ownership risks 

the wholesale commercial and industrial market also represents a promising opportunity given our utilityscale pv solar power system expertise the demand for corporate renewables is accelerating with corporations worldwide committing to the re100 campaign a collaborative global initiative of influential businesses committed to 100 renewable electricity we believe we also have a competitive advantage in the commercial and industrial market due to many customers’ sensitivity to the experience bankability and financial viability of their suppliers and geographically diverse operating locations with our strong development expertise financial strength and global footprint we are well positioned to meet their needs for example our 227 mw ac  muscle shoals project and 58 mw ac  cove mountain solar 1 project are expected to provide energy for certain facebook inc data centers through ppas with tennessee valley authority and pacificorp respectively since our first corporate related ppa with apple inc we have contracted over 700 mw ac  of ppas associated with corporate customers to support their renewable energy goals 

competition 

with respect to our systems business we face competition from other providers of renewable energy solutions including developers of pv solar power systems and developers of other forms of renewable energy projects such as wind hydroelectric geothermal biomass and tidal projects to the extent other solar module manufacturers become more 

 14 

vertically integrated we expect to face increased competition from such companies as well we also face competition from other epc companies and joint venture type arrangements between epc companies and solar companies certain current or potential future competitors may have a low cost of capital andor access to foreign capital the decline in module prices over the last several years has increased interest in solar energy worldwide and there are limited barriers to entry in certain parts of the pv solar value chain depending on the geographic market accordingly competition at the system level can be intense thereby exerting downward pressure on systemlevel average selling prices industrywide see item 1a “risk factors – competition at the system level can be intense thereby potentially exerting downward pressure on systemlevel profit margins industrywide which could reduce our profitability and adversely affect our results of operations ” 

research and development 

our systems related rd activities are primarily focused on the objective of lowering the lcoe of a pv solar power system through reductions in bos costs improved system design and energy yield enhancements associated with systems that use our modules such rd efforts are also focused on continuing to improve our systems in terms of grid integration and reliability we conduct our rd activities for systems primarily in the united states innovations related to system design inverters and power converters hardware platforms and installation techniques and knowhow among other things can and are expected in the future to continue to reduce bos costs which can represent a significant portion of the costs associated with the construction of a typical utilityscale pv solar power system 

own and operate 

from time to time we may temporarily own and operate or retain interests in certain of our systems for a period of time based on strategic opportunities or market factors the ability to do so provides certain potential benefits including greater control over the sales process and offering a lower risk profile to project buyers as of december 31 2018  we owned and operated a number of systems in various geographic markets including chile india the united states and the asiapacific region as an owner and operator of certain systems in the united states we may be subject to the authority of the federal energy regulatory commission “ferc” as well as various other federal state and local regulatory bodies for more information about risks related to owning and operating such systems please see item 1a “risk factors – as an owner and operator of pv solar power systems that deliver electricity to the grid certain of our affiliated entities may be regulated as public utilities under us federal and state law which could adversely affect the cost of doing business and limit our growth ” for more information about the economics of such ownership and the impacts on our liquidity see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources” 

intellectual property 

our success depends in part on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technology and to conduct our business without infringing on the proprietary rights of others we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks and trade secrets as well as associate and thirdparty confidentiality agreements to safeguard our intellectual property we regularly file patent applications to protect inventions arising from our rd activities and are currently pursuing patent applications in the united states and other countries our patent applications and any future patent applications might not result in a patent being issued with the scope of the claims we seek or at all and any patents we may receive may be challenged invalidated or declared unenforceable in addition we have registered andor have applied to register trademarks and service marks in the united states and a number of foreign countries for “first solar” 

with respect to proprietary knowhow that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce we rely on among other things trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests we believe that many elements of our pv solar module manufacturing processes including our unique materials sourcing involve proprietary knowhow technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications including technical processes equipment designs algorithms and procedures we have taken security measures to protect these elements our rd personnel have entered into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us these 

 15 

agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our associates to assign to us all of the inventions designs and technologies they develop during the course of their employment with us we also require our customers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose sensitive aspects of our modules technology or business plans we have not been subject to any material intellectual property infringement or misappropriation claims 

environmental health and safety matters 

our operations include the use handling storage transportation generation and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes we are subject to various national state local and international laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the use management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes occupational health and safety and the cleanup of contaminated sites therefore we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions and costs arising from thirdparty property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations or noncompliance with environmental permits required for our operations we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety requirements and do not expect to incur material expenditures for environmental and occupational health and safety controls in the foreseeable future however future developments such as the implementation of new more stringent laws and regulations more aggressive enforcement policies or the discovery of unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see item 1a “risk factors – environmental obligations and liabilities could have a substantial negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations ” 

corporate history 

we were incorporated in delaware in february 2006 and completed our initial public offering of common stock in november 2006

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the following information together with the other information in this annual report on form 10k before buying shares of our stock if any of the following risks or uncertainties occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our stock could decline 

risks related to our markets and customers 

competition in solar markets globally and across the solar value chain is intense and could remain that way for an extended period of time an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may continue to cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  

in the aggregate we believe manufacturers of solar cells and modules have significant installed production capacity relative to global demand and the ability for additional capacity expansion for example we estimate that in 2018 over 20 gw dc  of capacity was added by solar module manufacturers particularly but not exclusively in asia we believe the solar industry may from time to time experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity exceeds global demand and that such periods will continue to put pressure on pricing we believe the solar industry is currently in such a period due in part to recent developments in china which include feedintariff reductions causing deferment of incountry project development during the past several years industry average selling prices per watt have declined at times significantly both at the module and system levels as competitors have reduced prices to sell inventories worldwide there may be additional pressure on global demand and average selling prices in the future resulting from fluctuating demand in certain major solar markets such as china if our competitors reduce module pricing to levels near or below their manufacturing costs or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time or if demand for pv modules does not grow sufficiently to justify the current production supply our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

if pv solar and related technologies are not suitable for widespread adoption at economically attractive rates of return or if sufficient additional demand for solar modules related technologies and systems does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate our net sales and profit may flatten or decline and we may be unable to sustain profitability 

in comparison to traditional forms of energy generation the solar energy market continues to be at a relatively early stage of development if utilityscale pv solar technology proves unsuitable for widespread adoption at economically attractive rates of return or if additional demand for solar modules and systems fails to develop sufficiently or takes longer to develop than we anticipate we may be unable to grow our business or generate sufficient net sales to sustain profitability in addition demand for solar modules related technologies and systems in our targeted markets may develop to a lesser extent than we anticipate many factors may affect the viability of widespread adoption of utilityscale pv solar technology in our targeted markets as well as the demand for solar modules and systems generally including the following 

 

 

 19 

 

 

 

 

 

the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives tax incentives renewable energy targets and other support for ongrid solar electricity applications or other adverse public policies such as tariffs or other trade remedies imposed on solar cells and modules could negatively impact demand andor price levels for our solar modules and systems and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales thereby adversely impacting our operating results  

although we believe that solar energy will experience widespread adoption in those applications where it competes economically with traditional forms of energy without any support programs in certain markets our net sales and profits remain subject to variability based on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives federal state and local governmental bodies in many countries have provided subsidies in the form of fits rebates tax incentives and other incentives to endusers distributors system integrators and manufacturers of pv solar products many of these support programs expire phase out over time require renewal by the applicable authority or may be amended a summary of certain recent developments in the major government support programs that may impact our business appears under item 1 “business – support programs” to the extent these support programs are reduced earlier than previously expected or are changed retroactively such changes could negatively impact demand andor price levels for our solar modules and systems lead to a reduction in our net sales and adversely impact our operating results another consideration in the us market and to a lesser extent in other global markets is the effect of governmental landuse planning policies and environmental policies on utilityscale pv solar development the adoption of restrictive landuse designations or environmental regulations that proscribe or restrict the siting of utilityscale solar facilities could adversely affect the marginal cost of such development 

in addition policies of the us presidential administration may create regulatory uncertainty in the renewable energy industry including the solar industry and our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected members of the us presidential administration including representatives of the us department of energy have made public statements that indicate that the administration may not be supportive of various clean energy programs and initiatives designed to curtail climate change for example in june 2017 the us president announced that the united states would withdraw from participation in the 2015 paris agreement on climate change mitigation in addition the administration has indicated that it may be supportive of overturning or modifying policies of or regulations enacted by the prior administration that placed limitations on gas and coal electricity generation mining andor exploration additionally in october 2017 the us epa issued a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing to repeal the previous us presidential administration’s clean power plan which establishes standards to limit carbon dioxide emissions from existing power generation facilities in august 2018 the us epa proposed the ace rule which would establish guidelines for states to develop plans to address greenhouse gas emissions from existing coalfired power plants the 

 20 

ace rule would replace the clean power plan which the us epa has proposed to repeal if the current us administration andor the us congress takes action or continues to publicly speak out about the need to take action in furtherance of any such policies we would be subject to significant risks including the following 

 

 

 

application of us trade laws or trade laws of other countries may also impact either directly or indirectly our operating results for example in january 2018 following a petition filed by a usbased manufacturer of solar cells under sections 201 and 202 of the trade act of 1974 for global safeguard relief with the us international trade commission the “usitc” requesting among other things the imposition of certain tariffs on crystalline silicon solar cells imported into the united states and the establishment of a minimum price per watt on imported crystalline silicon solar modules the us president proclaimed tariffs on imported crystalline silicon modules and a tariffrate quota on imported crystalline silicon cells over a fouryear period with the tariff on modules and the tariff on cells above the first 25 gw dc  of imports starting at 30 for the february 2018 to february 2019 period and declining by five percentage points in each subsequent 12month period thin film solar cell products such as our cdte technology are expressly excluded from the tariffs in addition the usitc is expected to review developments regarding the relevant domestic industry including its efforts to adjust to import competition and issue a report to the us president by february 2020 such report could serve as a basis for the us president to reduce modify or terminate the safeguard tariffs 

the united states has also imposed import tariffs in connection with other proceedings during 2018 in march 2018 the us president proclaimed tariffs on certain imported aluminum and steel articles generally at rates of 10 and 25 respectively under section 232 of the trade expansion act of 1962 all countries except argentina and australia are covered by the aluminum tariff all countries except argentina australia brazil and south korea are covered by the steel tariff and the steel tariff rate on imports from turkey is 50 rather than 25 in addition in may 2018 the us president proclaimed absolute quotas for the import of aluminum articles from argentina and the import of steel articles from argentina brazil and south korea separately in a series of actions during 2018 that followed an investigation under section 301 of the trade act of 1974 the united states imposed tariffs on various articles imported 

 21 

from china at a rate of 25 including silicon solar cells and modules certain other articles imported from china are subject to tariffs at a rate of 10 which is scheduled to rise to 25 in march 2019 unless the united states determines not to do so based on negotiations with china 

internationally in july 2018 the indian government imposed a safeguard duty on solar cells and modules imported from various countries including member countries of the organisation for economic cooperation and development “oecd” china and malaysia for a twoyear period starting at 25 through july 2019 and declining by five percentage points in each subsequent sixmonth period such tariffs or any other us or global trade remedies or other trade barriers may directly or indirectly affect us or global markets for solar energy and our business financial condition and results of operations 

these examples show that established markets for pv solar development face uncertainties arising from policy regulatory and governmental constraints while the expected potential of the emerging markets we are targeting is significant policy promulgation and market development are especially vulnerable to governmental inertia political instability the imposition of trade remedies and other trade barriers geopolitical risk fossil fuel subsidization potentially stringent localization requirements and limited available infrastructure 

we may be unable to fully execute on our longterm strategic plans which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we face numerous difficulties in executing on our longterm strategic plans particularly in new foreign jurisdictions including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 22 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition please see the risk factors entitled “ our substantial international operations subject us to a number of risks including unfavorable political regulatory labor and tax conditions in the united states andor foreign countries ” and “ the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives tax incentives renewable energy targets and other support for ongrid solar electricity applications or other adverse public policies such as tariffs or other trade remedies imposed on solar cells and modules could negatively impact demand andor price levels for our solar modules and systems and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales thereby adversely impacting our operating results ” 

the loss of any of our large customers or their inability to perform under their contracts could significantly reduce our net sales and negatively impact our results of operations 

our customers include integrators and operators of systems utilities independent power producers commercial and industrial companies and other system owners who may experience intense competition at the system level thereby constraining the ability for such customers to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability the loss of any of our large customers their inability to perform under their contracts or their default in payment could significantly reduce our net sales andor adversely impact our operating results while our contracts with customers typically have certain firm purchase commitments and may include provisions for the payment of amounts to us in certain events of contract termination these contracts may be subject to amendments made by us or requested by our customers these amendments may reduce the volume of modules to be sold under the contract adjust delivery schedules or otherwise decrease the expected revenue under these contracts although we believe that we can mitigate this risk in part by reallocating modules to other customers if the need arises we may be unable in whole or in part to do so on similar terms or at all we may also mitigate this risk by requiring some form of payment security from our customers such as parent guarantees bank guarantees surety bonds or commercial letters of credit however in the event the providers of such payment security fail to perform their obligations our operating results could be adversely impacted 

we may be unable to profitably provide new solar offerings or achieve sufficient market penetration with such offerings 

we may expand our portfolio of offerings to include solutions that build upon our core competencies but for which we have not had significant historical experience including variations in our traditional product offerings or other offerings related to commercial and industrial customers and community solar we cannot be certain that we will be able to ascertain and allocate the appropriate financial and human resources necessary to grow these business areas we could invest capital into growing these businesses but fail to address market or customer needs or otherwise not experience

a satisfactory level of financial return also in expanding into these areas we may be competing against companies that previously have not been significant competitors such as companies that currently have substantially more experience than we do in the residential commercial and industrial or other targeted offerings if we are unable to achieve growth in these areas our overall growth and financial performance may be limited relative to our competitors and our operating results could be adversely impacted 

an increase in interest rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets including a reduction in total tax equity availability could make it difficult for customers to finance the cost of a pv solar power system and could reduce the demand for our modules or systems andor lead to a reduction in the average selling price for such offerings  

many of our customers and our systems business depend on debt andor equity financing to fund the initial capital expenditure required to develop build andor purchase a pv solar power system as a result an increase in interest rates or a reduction in the supply of project debt financing or tax equity investments including reductions due to a change in tax related incentives that benefit tax equity investors such as the reduction of the us corporate income tax rate to 21 under the tax act which could reduce the value of these incentives could reduce the number of solar projects that receive financing or otherwise make it difficult for our customers or our systems business to secure the financing necessary to develop build purchase or install a pv solar power system on favorable terms or at all and thus lower demand for our solar modules which could limit our growth or reduce our net sales see the risk factor entitled “ the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives tax incentives renewable energy targets and other support for ongrid solar electricity applications or other adverse public policies such as tariffs or other trade remedies imposed on solar cells and modules could negatively impact demand andor price levels for our solar modules and systems and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales thereby adversely impacting our operating results ” for additional information in addition we believe that a significant percentage of our customers install systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt an increase in interest rates and the reduction of the us corporate income tax rate as described above could lower an investor’s return on investment in a system increase equity return requirements or make alternative investments more attractive relative to pv solar power systems and in each case could cause these customers to seek alternative investments 

risks related to our operations manufacturing and technology 

our future success depends on our ability to effectively balance manufacturing production with market demand convert existing production facilities to support new product lines such as our transition to series 6 module manufacturing and when necessary continue to build new manufacturing plants over time in response to such demand and add production lines in a costeffective manner all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties  

our future success depends on our ability to effectively balance manufacturing production with market demand convert existing production facilities to support new product lines such as our transition to series 6 module manufacturing and increase both our manufacturing capacity and production throughput over time in a costeffective and efficient manner if we cannot do so we may be unable to expand our business decrease our manufacturing cost per watt maintain our competitive position satisfy our contractual obligations sustain profitability or create longterm shareholder value our ability to expand production capacity or to convert existing production facilities to support new product lines such as our transition to series 6 module manufacturing is subject to significant risks and uncertainties including the following

we face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules as well as other thin film solar modules if global supply exceeds global demand it could lead to a further reduction in the average selling price for pv solar modules  which could reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations 

the solar and renewable energy industries are highly competitive and are continually evolving as participants strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete with the larger electric power industry within the global pv solar industry we face intense competition from crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers and other thin film solar module manufacturers existing or future solar module manufacturers might be acquired by larger companies with significant capital resources thereby further intensifying competition with us in addition the introduction of a low cost disruptive technology could adversely affect our ability to compete which could reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations 

even if demand for solar modules continues to grow the rapid manufacturing capacity expansion undertaken by many module manufacturers particularly manufacturers of crystalline silicon cells and modules has created and may continue to cause periods of structural imbalance in which supply exceeds demand see the risk factor entitled “ competition in solar markets globally and across the solar value chain is intense and could remain that way for an extended period of time an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may continue to cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations ” for additional information in addition we believe any significant decrease in the cost of silicon feedstock or polysilicon would reduce the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon modules and lead to further pricing pressure for solar modules and potentially an oversupply of solar modules we also believe many crystalline silicon cell and wafer manufacturers continue to transition from lower efficiency back surface field “bsf” multicrystalline cells the legacy technology against which we have generally competed in our markets to higher efficiency passivated emitter rear contact “perc” multicrystalline and monocrystalline cells at competitive cost structures as a result we expect that in the future our primary competition might transition to multicrystalline and monocrystalline perc based modules with higher conversion efficiencies additionally while conventional solar modules including the solar modules we produce are monofacial meaning their ability to produce energy is a function of direct and diffuse irradiance on their front side certain manufacturers of monocrystalline perc solar modules are pursuing the commercialization of bifacial modules that also capture diffuse irradiance on the back side of a module such technology can improve the overall energy production of a module relative to nameplate efficiency when applied in certain applications and bos configurations which could potentially lower the overall lcoe of a system when compared to systems using conventional solar modules including the modules we produce 

during any such period our competitors could decide to reduce their sales prices in response to competition even below their manufacturing costs in order to generate sales and may do so for a sustained period other competitors may have direct or indirect access to sovereign capital which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time as a result we may be unable to sell our solar modules or systems at attractive prices or for a profit during any period of excess supply of solar modules which would reduce 

 25 

our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations additionally we may decide to lower our average selling prices to certain customers in certain markets in response to competition which could also reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations 

problems with product quality or performance including our series 4 modules and series 6 modules may cause us to incur significant andor unexpected contractual damages andor warranty and related expenses damage our market reputation and prevent us from maintaining or increasing our market share 

we perform a variety of module quality and life tests under different conditions upon which we base our assessments and warranty of module performance over the duration of the warranty however if our thin film solar modules including our series 4 modules and series 6 modules perform below expectations we could experience significant warranty and related expenses damage to our market reputation and erosion of our market share with respect to our modules we provide a limited warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for approximately 10 years we also typically warrant that modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 98  of their labeled power output rating during the first year with the warranty coverage reducing by 05  every year thereafter throughout the approximate 25year limited power output warranty period as an alternative form of our standard limited module power output warranty we also offer an aggregated or systemlevel limited module performance warranty this systemlevel limited module performance warranty is designed for utilityscale systems and provides 25year systemlevel energy degradation protection this warranty represents a practical expedient to address the challenge of identifying from the potential millions of modules installed in a utilityscale system individual modules that may be performing below warranty thresholds by focusing on the aggregate energy generated by the system rather than the power output of individual modules the systemlevel limited module performance warranty is typically calculated as a percentage of a system’s expected energy production adjusted for certain actual site conditions with the warranted level of performance declining each year in a linear fashion but never falling below 80  during the term of the warranty as a result of these warranty programs we bear the risk of product warranty claims long after we have sold our solar modules and recognized net sales 

if any of the assumptions used in estimating our module warranties prove incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses which could adversely impact our financial position operating results and cash flows although we have taken significant precautions to avoid a manufacturing excursion from occurring any manufacturing excursions including any commitments made by us to take remediation actions in respect of affected modules beyond the stated remedies in our warranties could adversely impact our reputation financial position operating results and cash flows 

although our module performance warranties extend for 25 years our oldest solar modules manufactured during the qualification of our pilot production line have only been in use since 2001 accordingly our warranties are based on a variety of quality and life tests that enable predictions of durability and future performance these predictions however could prove to be materially different from the actual performance during the warranty period causing us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective solar modules or provide financial remuneration in the future for example our solar modules including our series 4 modules and series 6 modules could suffer various failure modes including breakage delamination corrosion or performance degradation in excess of expectations and our manufacturing operations or supply chain could be subject to materials or process variations that could cause affected modules to fail or underperform compared to our expectations these risks could be amplified as we implement design and process changes in connection with our efforts to improve our products and accelerate module wattage as part of our longterm strategic plans and as we transition to series 6 module manufacturing in addition as we increase the number of installations in extreme climates we may experience increased failure rates due to deployment into such field conditions any widespread product failures may damage our market reputation cause our net sales to decline require us to repair or replace the defective modules or provide financial remuneration and result in us taking voluntary remedial measures beyond those required by our standard warranty terms to enhance customer satisfaction which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

in resolving claims under both the limited defect and power output warranties we typically have the option of either repairing or replacing the covered modules or under the limited power output warranty providing additional modules 

 26 

to remedy the power shortfall or making certain cash payments however historical versions of our module warranty did not provide a refund remedy consequently we may be obligated to repair or replace the covered modules under such historical programs as our manufacturing process may change from timetotime in accordance with our technology roadmap we may elect to stop production of older versions of our modules that would constitute compatible replacement modules in some jurisdictions our inability to provide compatible replacement modules could potentially expose us to liabilities beyond the limitations of our module warranties which could adversely impact our reputation financial position operating results and cash flows 

for pv solar power systems we construct we typically provide limited warranties for defects in engineering design installation and bos part workmanship for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a system or a block within the system in resolving claims under such bos warranties we have the option of remedying the defect through repair or replacement as with our modules these warranties are based on a variety of quality and life tests that enable predictions of durability and future performance any failures in bos equipment or system construction beyond our expectations may also adversely impact our reputation financial position operating results and cash flows 

in addition our contracts with customers including contracts for the sale of series 6 modules may include provisions with particular product specifications minimum wattage requirements and specified delivery schedules these contracts may be terminated or we may incur significant liquidated damages or other damages if we fail to perform our contractual obligations in addition our costs to perform under these contracts may exceed our estimates which could adversely impact our profitability we have only recently commenced commercial production of our series 6 modules and have limited experience satisfying our obligations under the related sales arrangements any failures to comply with our contracts for the sale of our modules including our series 6 modules could adversely impact our reputation financial position operating results and cash flows 

our failure to further refine our technology reduce module manufacturing and bos costs and develop and introduce improved pv products could render our solar modules or systems uncompetitive and reduce our net sales profitability andor market share 

we need to continue to invest significant financial resources in rd to continue to improve our module conversion efficiencies lower the lcoe of our pv solar power systems and otherwise keep pace with technological advances in the solar industry however rd activities are inherently uncertain and we could encounter practical difficulties in commercializing our research results we seek to continuously improve our products and processes including for example our transition to series 6 module manufacturing and the resulting changes carry potential risks in the form of delays performance additional costs or other unintended contingencies in addition our significant expenditures for rd may not produce corresponding benefits other companies are developing a variety of competing pv technologies including advanced multicrystalline silicon cells perc or advanced ptype crystalline silicon cells highefficiency ntype crystalline silicon cells copper indium gallium diselenide thin films amorphous silicon thin films and new emerging technologies such as hybrid perovskites which could produce solar modules or systems that prove more costeffective or have better performance than our solar modules or systems 

in addition other companies could potentially develop a highly reliable renewable energy system that mitigates the intermittent power generation drawback of many renewable energy systems or offer other valueadded improvements from the perspective of utilities and other system owners in which case such companies could compete with us even if the lcoe associated with such new systems is higher than that of our systems as a result our solar modules or systems may be negatively differentiated or rendered obsolete by the technological advances of our competitors which would reduce our net sales profitability andor market share in addition we often forward price our products and services in anticipation of future cost reductions and technology improvements and thus an inability to further refine our technology and execute our module technology and cost reduction roadmaps could adversely affect our operating results 

 27 

if our estimates regarding the future costs of collecting and recycling cdte solar modules covered by our solar module collection and recycling program are incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses and face a significant unplanned cash burden 

as necessary we fund any incremental amounts for our estimated collection and recycling obligations on an annual basis based on the estimated costs of collecting and recycling covered modules estimated rates of return on our restricted investments and an estimated solar module life of 25 years less amounts already funded in prior years we estimate the cost of our collection and recycling obligations based on the present value of the expected probabilityweighted future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules which includes estimates for the cost of packaging materials the cost of freight from the solar module installation sites to a recycling center material labor and capital costs the scale of recycling centers and an estimated thirdparty profit margin and return on risk for collection and recycling services we base these estimates on i our experience collecting and recycling our solar modules ii the expected timing of when our solar modules will be returned for recycling and iii the expected economic factors at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled if our estimates prove incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses and could also face a significant unplanned cash burden at the time we realize our estimates are incorrect or endusers return their modules which could adversely affect our operating results in addition participating endusers can return their modules covered under the collection and recycling program at any time as a result we could be required to collect and recycle covered cdte solar modules earlier than we expect 

our failure to protect our intellectual property rights may undermine our competitive position and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against thirdparty allegations of infringement may be costly 

protection of our proprietary processes methods and other technology is critical to our business failure to protect and monitor the use of our existing intellectual property rights could result in the loss of valuable technologies we rely primarily on patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property we regularly file patent applications to protect certain inventions arising from our rd and are currently pursuing such patent applications in various countries in accordance with our strategy for intellectual property in that jurisdiction our existing patents and future patents could be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents or if patents are issued to us such patents may not be sufficient to provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies 

we also rely on unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position although we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our associates and third parties to protect our intellectual property such confidentiality agreements are limited in duration and could be breached and may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary manufacturing expertise adequate remedies may not be available in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise in addition others may obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or legal means the failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes equipment technology trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise methods and compounds could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries especially any developing countries into which we may expand our operations in some countries we have not applied for patent trademark or copyright protection 

third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary technologies or other intellectual property rights which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology can be difficult and expensive additionally litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others we cannot ensure that the outcome of such potential litigation will be in our favor and such litigation may be costly and may divert management attention and other resources away from our business an adverse determination in any such litigation may impair our intellectual property rights and may harm our business prospects and reputation in addition we have no insurance coverage against such litigation costs and would have to bear all costs arising from such litigation to the extent we are unable to recover them from other parties 

 28 

some of our manufacturing equipment is customized and sole sourced if our manufacturing equipment fails or if our equipment suppliers fail to perform under their contracts we could experience production disruptions and be unable to satisfy our contractual requirements 

some of our manufacturing equipment including manufacturing equipment related to the production of our series 6 modules is customized to our production lines based on designs or specifications that we provide to equipment manufacturers which then undertake a specialized process to manufacture the custom equipment as a result the equipment is not readily available from multiple vendors and would be difficult to repair or replace if it were to become delayed damaged or stop working if any piece of equipment fails production along the entire production line could be interrupted in addition the failure of our equipment manufacturers to supply equipment in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms could delay our expansion or conversion plans otherwise disrupt our production schedule andor increase our manufacturing costs all of which would adversely impact our operating results 

several of our key raw materials and components are either singlesourced or sourced from a limited number of suppliers and their failure to perform could cause manufacturing delays and impair our ability to deliver solar modules to customers in the required quality and quantities and at a price that is profitable to us 

our failure to obtain raw materials and components that meet our quality quantity and cost requirements in a timely manner could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture our solar modules or increase our manufacturing costs several of our key raw materials and components are either singlesourced or sourced from a limited number of suppliers as a result the failure of any of our suppliers to perform could disrupt our supply chain and adversely impact our operations in addition some of our suppliers are smaller companies that may be unable to supply our increasing demand for raw materials and components as we expand our business we may be unable to identify new suppliers or qualify their products for use on our production lines in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms a constraint on our production may result in our inability to meet our capacity plans andor our obligations under our customer contracts which would have an adverse impact on our business additionally reductions in our production volume may put pressure on suppliers resulting in increased material and component costs 

a disruption in our supply chain for cdte could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture solar modules and could adversely impact our profitability and longterm growth prospects 

a key raw material used in our module production process is a cdte compound tellurium one of the main components of cdte is mainly produced as a byproduct of copper refining and therefore its supply is largely dependent upon demand for copper our supply of cdte could be limited if any of our current suppliers or any of our future suppliers are unable to acquire an adequate supply of tellurium in a timely manner or at commercially reasonable prices if our current suppliers or any of our future suppliers cannot obtain sufficient tellurium they could substantially increase prices or be unable to perform under their contracts furthermore if our competitors begin to use or increase their demand for tellurium our requirements for tellurium increase new applications for tellurium become available or adverse trade laws or policies restrict our ability to obtain tellurium from foreign vendors or make doing so cost prohibitive the supply of tellurium and related cdte compounds could be reduced and prices could increase as we may be unable to pass such increases in the costs of our raw materials through to our customers a substantial increase in tellurium prices or any limitations in the supply of tellurium could adversely impact our profitability and longterm growth objectives 

if any future production lines are not built in line with committed schedules it may adversely affect our future growth plans if any future production lines do not achieve operating metrics similar to our existing production lines our solar modules could perform below expectations and cause us to lose customers 

if we are unable to systematically replicate our production lines over time and achieve operating metrics similar to our existing production lines our manufacturing capacity could be substantially constrained our manufacturing costs per watt could increase and our growth could be limited such factors may result in lower net sales and lower net income than we anticipate for instance future production lines such as those at our manufacturing facilities in ho chi minh 

 29 

city vietnam and perrysburg ohio could produce solar modules that have lower conversion efficiencies higher failure rates andor higher rates of degradation than solar modules from our existing production lines and we could be unable to determine the cause of the lower operating metrics or develop and implement solutions to improve performance 

our substantial international operations subject us to a number of risks including unfavorable political regulatory labor and tax conditions in the united states andor foreign countries  

we have significant manufacturing development construction sales and marketing operations both within and outside the united states and expect to continue to expand our operations worldwide as a result we are subject to the legal political social tax and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions 

risks inherent to international operations include but are not limited to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 30 

 

our business in foreign markets requires us to respond to rapid changes in market conditions in these countries our overall success as a global business depends in part on our ability to succeed in differing legal regulatory economic social and political conditions we may not be able to develop and implement policies and strategies that will be effective in each location where we do business 

risks related to our systems business 

project development or construction activities may not be successful projects under development may not receive required permits real property rights ppas interconnection and transmission arrangements or financing or construction may not commence or proceed as scheduled which could increase our costs and impair our ability to recover our investments  

the development and construction of solar energy generation facilities and other energy infrastructure projects involve numerous risks we may be required to spend significant sums for land and interconnection rights preliminary engineering permitting legal services and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built success in developing a particular project is contingent upon among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 31 

 

 

 

successful completion of a particular project may be adversely affected delayed andor rendered infeasible by numerous factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 32 

 

 

 

if we fail to complete the development of a solar energy project fail to meet one or more agreed upon target construction milestone dates fail to achieve systemlevel capacity or fail to meet other contract terms we may be subject to forfeiture of significant deposits under ppas or interconnection agreements or termination of such agreements incur significant liquidated damages penalties andor other obligations under other project related agreements and may not be able to recover our investment in the project if we are unable to complete the development of a solar energy project we may impair some or all of these capitalized investments which would have an adverse impact on our net income in the period in which the loss is recognized 

we may be unable to acquire or lease land obtain necessary interconnection and transmission rights andor obtain the approvals licenses permits and electric transmission grid interconnection and transmission rights necessary to build and operate pv solar power systems in a timely and cost effective manner and regulatory agencies local communities labor unions tribes or other third parties may delay prevent or increase the cost of construction and operation of the system we intend to build 

in order to construct and operate our pv solar power systems we need to acquire or lease land and rights of way obtain interconnection rights negotiate agreements with affected transmission systems and obtain all necessary federal state county local and foreign approvals licenses and permits as well as rights to interconnect the systems to the transmission grid and transmit energy generated from the system we may be unable to acquire the land or lease interests needed may not obtain or maintain satisfactory interconnection rights may have difficulty reaching agreements with affected transmission systems andor incur unexpected network upgrade costs may not receive or retain the requisite approvals permits licenses and interconnection and transmission rights or may encounter other problems that could delay or prevent us from successfully constructing and operating such systems 

many of our proposed projects are located on or require access through public lands administered by federal and state agencies pursuant to competitive public leasing and rightofway procedures and processes our projects may also be located on tribal land pursuant to land agreements that must be approved by tribal governments and federal agencies the authorization for the use construction and operation of systems and associated transmission facilities on federal state tribal and private lands will also require the assessment and evaluation of mineral rights private rightsofway and other easements environmental agricultural cultural recreational and aesthetic impacts and the likely mitigation of adverse impacts to these and other resources and uses the inability to obtain the required permits and other federal state local and tribal approvals and any excessive delays in obtaining such permits and approvals due for example to litigation or thirdparty appeals could potentially prevent us from successfully constructing and operating such systems in a timely manner and could result in the potential forfeiture of any deposit we have made with respect to a given project moreover project approvals subject to project modifications and conditions including mitigation requirements and costs could affect the financial success of a given project changing regulatory requirements and the discovery of unknown site conditions could also affect the financial success of a given project 

in addition local labor unions may increase the cost of project development in california and elsewhere we may also be subject to labor unavailability andor increased union labor requirements due to multiple simultaneous projects in a geographic region 

competition at the system level can be intense thereby potentially exerting downward pressure on systemlevel profit margins industrywide which could reduce our profitability and adversely affect our results of operations  

the significant decline in pv solar module prices over the last several years continues to create a challenging environment for module manufacturers but it has also helped drive demand for solar electricity worldwide aided by such lower 

 33 

module prices our customers and potential customers have in many cases been willing and able to bid aggressively for new projects and ppas using low cost assumptions for modules bos parts installation maintenance and other costs as the basis for such bids relatively low barriers to entry for solar project developers and epc companies including those we compete with have led to depending on the market and other factors intense competition at the system level which may result in an environment in which systemlevel pricing falls rapidly thereby further increasing demand for solar energy solutions but constraining the ability for project developers epc companies and verticallyintegrated companies such as first solar to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability accordingly while we believe our system offerings and experience are positively differentiated in many cases from that of our competitors we may fail to correctly identify our competitive position we may be unable to develop or maintain a sufficient magnitude of new system projects worldwide at economically attractive rates of return and we may not otherwise be able to achieve meaningful profitability under our longterm strategic plans 

depending on the market opportunity we may be at a disadvantage compared to potential systemlevel competitors for example certain of our competitors may have a stronger andor more established localized business presence in a particular geographic region certain of our competitors may be larger entities that have greater financial resources and greater overall brand name recognition than we do and as a result may be better positioned to impact customer behavior or adapt to changes in the industry or the economy as a whole certain competitors may also have direct or indirect access to sovereign capital andor other incentives which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time 

additionally largescale solar systems are still in their relatively early stages of existence and depending on the geographic area certain potential customers may still be in the process of educating themselves about the points of differentiation among various available providers of pv solar energy solutions including a company’s proven overall experience and bankability system design and optimization expertise grid interconnection and stabilization expertise and proven om capabilities if we are unable over time to meaningfully differentiate our offerings at scale or if available competitive pricing is prioritized over the value we believe is added through our system offerings and experience from the viewpoint of our potential customer base our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we may not be able to obtain longterm contracts for the sale of power produced by our projects at prices and on other terms favorable to attract financing and other investments  with regard to projects for which electricity is or will be sold on an open contract basis rather than under a ppa our results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent prevailing spot electricity prices decline in an unexpected manner 

obtaining longterm contracts for the sale of power produced by our projects at prices and on other terms favorable to us is essential for obtaining financing and commencing construction of our projects we must compete for ppas against other developers of solar and renewable energy projects this intense competition for ppas has resulted in downward pressure on ppa pricing for newly contracted projects in addition we believe the solar industry may experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand that put downward pressure on module pricing this downward pressure on module pricing also creates downward pressure on ppa pricing for newly contracted projects see the risk factor entitled “ competition at the system level can be intense thereby potentially exerting downward pressure on systemlevel profit margins industrywide which could reduce our profitability and adversely affect our results of operations ” for additional information if falling ppa pricing results in forecasted project revenue that is insufficient to generate returns anticipated to be demanded in the project sale market our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

other sources of power such as natural gasfired power plants have historically been cheaper than the cost of solar power and certain types of generation projects such as natural gasfired power plants can deliver power on a firm basis the inability to compete successfully against other power producers or otherwise enter into ppas favorable to us would negatively affect our ability to develop and finance our projects and negatively impact our revenue in addition the availability of ppas is dependent on utility and corporate energy procurement practices that could evolve and shift allocation of market risks over time in addition ppa availability and terms are a function of a number of economic 

 34 

regulatory tax and public policy factors which are also subject to change furthermore certain of our projects may be scheduled for substantial completion prior to the commencement of a longterm ppa with a major offtaker in which case we would be required to enter into a stubperiod ppa for the intervening time period or sell down the project we may not be able to do either on terms that are commercially attractive to us finally the electricity from certain of our projects is or is expected to be sold on an open contract basis for a period of time rather than under a ppa if prevailing spot electricity prices relating to any such project were to decline in an unexpected manner such project may decline in value and our results of operations could otherwise be adversely affected 

even if we are able to obtain ppas favorable to us the ability of our offtake counterparties to fulfill their contractual obligations to us depends in part on their creditworthiness these counterparties such as our investorowned utility counterparties in the state of california which may have liability for damages associated with california’s recent wildfires could suffer a deterioration of their creditworthiness or become and in one case has become subject to bankruptcy insolvency or liquidation proceedings or otherwise for example in january 2019 pge corporation and pacific gas and electric company the counterparty to our 75 mw ac  willow springs 3 project which is expected to achieve commercial operation in 2021 filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of title 11 of the united states code in the us bankruptcy court for the northern district of california if one or more of our counterparties becomes subject to bankruptcy insolvency or liquidation proceedings or if the creditworthiness of any counterparty deteriorates we could experience an underpayment or nonpayment under ppa agreements and our ability to attract debt or equity financing for our projects could be impaired 

lack of transmission capacity availability potential upgrade costs to the transmission grid and other system constraints could significantly impact our ability to build pv solar power systems and generate solar electricity power sales 

in order to deliver electricity from our pv solar power systems to our customers our projects generally need to connect to the transmission grid the lack of available capacity on the transmission grid could substantially impact our projects and cause reductions in project size delays in project implementation increases in costs from transmission upgrades and potential forfeitures of any deposit we have made with respect to a given project in addition there could be unexpected costs required to complete transmission and network upgrades that adversely impact the economic viability of our pv solar power systems these transmission and network issues and costs as well as issues relating to the availability of large equipment such as transformers and switchgear could significantly impact our ability to interconnect our systems to the transmission grid build such systems and generate solar electricity sales 

our systems business is largely dependent on us and third parties arranging financing from various sources which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms or in insufficient amounts 

the construction of large utilityscale solar power projects in many cases requires project financing including nonrecourse project specific debt financing in the bank loan market and institutional debt capital markets uncertainties exist as to whether our planned projects will be able to access the debt markets in a magnitude sufficient to finance their construction if we are unable to arrange such financing or if it is only available on unfavorable terms we may be unable to fully execute our systems business plans in addition we generally expect to sell interests in our projects by raising project equity capital from taxoriented strategic industry and other equity investors such equity sources may not be available or may only be available in insufficient amounts or on unfavorable terms in which case our ability to sell interests in our projects may be delayed or limited and our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected uncertainty in or adverse changes to tax policy including the amount of itc or accelerated depreciation and any limitations on the value or availability to potential investors of tax incentives that benefit solar energy projects such as the itc and accelerated depreciation deductions as well as the reduction of the us corporate income tax rate to 21 under the tax act which could reduce the value of these tax related incentives may reduce project values or negatively affect our ability to timely secure equity investment for our projects even if such financing sources are available the counterparty to many of our fixedprice epc contracts which own the projects we are constructing are often special purpose vehicles that do not have significant assets other than their interests in the project and have pledged all or substantially all of these assets to secure the projectrelated debt and certain other sources of 

 35 

financing if the owner defaults on its payments or other obligations to us we may face difficulties in collecting payment of amounts due to us for the costs previously incurred or for the amounts previously expended or committed to be expended to purchase equipment or supplies or for termination payments we are entitled to under the terms of the related epc contract if we are unable to collect the amounts owed to us or are unable to complete the project because of an owner default we may be required to record certain charges related to the project which could result in a material loss 

in addition for projects to which we provide epc services but are not the project developer our epc activities are in many cases dependent on the ability of third parties to finance their system projects on acceptable terms depending on prevailing conditions in the credit markets interest rates and other factors such financing may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms or in insufficient amounts if third parties are limited in their ability to access financing to support their purchase of system construction services from us we may not realize the cash flows that we expect from such sales which could adversely affect our ability to invest in our business andor generate revenue see also the risk factor above entitled “ an increase in interest rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets including a reduction in total tax equity availability could make it difficult for customers to finance the cost of a pv solar power system and could reduce the demand for our modules or systems andor lead to a reduction in the average selling price for such offerings  ” 

developing solar power projects may require significant upfront investment prior to the signing of an epc contract and commencing construction which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

solar power project development cycles which span the time between the identification of a site location and the construction of a system vary substantially and can take years to mature as a result of these long project development cycles we may need to make significant upfront investments of resources including for example payments for land rights large transmission and ppa deposits or other payments which may be nonrefundable in advance of the signing of epc contracts commencing construction receiving cash proceeds or recognizing any revenue our potential inability to enter into sales contracts with customers on favorable terms after making such upfront investments could cause us to forfeit certain nonrefundable payments or otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations furthermore we may become constrained in our ability to simultaneously fund our other business operations and these systems investments through our long project development cycles 

our liquidity may also be adversely affected to the extent the project sales market weakens and we are unable to sell interests in our solar projects on pricing timing and other terms commercially acceptable to us in such a scenario we may choose to continue to temporarily own and operate certain solar projects for a period of time after which interests in the projects may be sold to third parties 

we may be unable to accurately estimate costs under fixedprice epc agreements in which we act as the general contractor for our customers in connection with the construction and installation of their pv solar power systems 

we may enter into fixedprice epc contracts in which we act as the general contractor for our customers in connection with the installation of their pv solar power systems all essential costs are estimated at the time of entering into the epc contract for a particular project and these are reflected in the overall fixedprice that we charge our customers for the project these cost estimates are preliminary and may or may not be covered by contracts between us or the subcontractors suppliers and other parties to the project in addition we require qualified licensed subcontractors to install many of our systems shortages of such skilled labor could significantly delay a project or otherwise increase our costs should actual results prove different from our estimates including those due to unexpected increases in inflation commodity prices or labor costs or we experience delays in execution and we are unable to commensurately increase the epc sales price we may not achieve our expected margins or we may be required to record a loss in the relevant period 

 36 

we may be subject to unforeseen costs liabilities or obligations when providing om services in addition certain of our om agreements include provisions permitting the counterparty to terminate the agreement without cause 

we may provide ongoing om services to system owners under separate service agreements pursuant to which we generally perform standard activities associated with operating a pv solar power system including 247 monitoring and control compliance activities energy forecasting and scheduled and unscheduled maintenance our costs to perform these services are estimated at the time of entering into the om agreement for a particular project and these are reflected in the price we charge our customers including certain agreements which feature fixed pricing should our estimates of om costs prove inaccurate including any unexpected serial defects unavailability of parts or increases in inflation labor or bos costs our growth strategy and results of operations could be adversely affected because of the potentially longterm nature of these om agreements the adverse impacts on our results of operations could be significant particularly if our costs are not capped under the terms of the agreements in addition certain of our om agreements include provisions permitting the counterparty to terminate the agreement without cause or for convenience the exercise of such termination rights or the use of such rights as leverage to renegotiate terms and conditions of an om agreement including pricing terms could adversely impact our results of operations we may also be subject to substantial costs in the event we do not achieve certain thresholds under the effective availability guarantees included in our om agreements 

our systems business is subject to regulatory oversight and liability if we fail to operate pv solar power systems in compliance with electric reliability rules 

the ongoing om services that we provide for system owners may subject us to regulation by the nerc or its designated regional representative as a “generator operator” or “gop” under electric reliability rules filed with ferc our failure to comply with the reliability rules applicable to gops could subject us to substantial fines by nerc subject to ferc’s review in addition the system owners that receive our om services may be regulated by nerc as “generator owners” or “gos” and we may incur liability for go violations and fines levied by nerc subject to ferc’s review based on the terms of our om agreements finally as a system owner and operator we may in the future be subject to regulation by nerc as a go 

risks related to regulations 

existing regulations and policies changes thereto and new regulations and policies may present technical regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of pv solar products or systems which may significantly reduce demand for our modules systems or services 

the market for electricity generation products is heavily influenced by federal state local and foreign government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry as well as policies promulgated by electric utilities these regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and interconnection of customerowned electricity generation in the united states and in a number of other countries these regulations and policies have been modified in the past and may be modified again in the future these regulations and policies could deter enduser purchases of pv solar products or systems and investment in the rd of pv solar technology for example without a mandated regulatory exception for pv solar power systems system owners are often charged interconnection or standby fees for putting distributed power generation on the electric utility grid to the extent these interconnection standby fees are applicable to pv solar power systems it is likely that they would increase the cost of such systems which could make the systems less desirable thereby adversely affecting our business financial condition and results of operations in addition with respect to utilities that utilize a peakhour pricing policy or timeofuse pricing methods whereby the price of electricity is adjusted based on electricity supply and demand electricity generated by pv solar power systems currently benefits from competing primarily with expensive peakhour electricity rather than the less expensive average price of electricity modifications to the peakhour pricing policies of utilities such as to a flat rate for all times of the day would require pv solar power systems to have lower prices in order to compete with the price of electricity from other sources which could adversely impact our operating results 

 37 

our modules systems and services are often subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with national and local ordinances relating to building codes safety environmental protection utility interconnection and metering and other matters and tracking the requirements of individual jurisdictions is complex any new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to our modules systems or services may result in significant additional expenses to us or our customers and as a result could cause a significant reduction in demand for our modules systems or services in addition any regulatory compliance failure could result in significant management distraction unplanned costs andor reputational damage 

we could be adversely affected by any violations of the fcpa the uk bribery act and other foreign antibribery laws  

the fcpa generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business other countries in which we operate also have antibribery laws some of which prohibit improper payments to government and nongovernment persons and entities and others eg the fcpa and the uk bribery act extend their application to activities outside of their country of origin our policies mandate compliance with all applicable antibribery laws we currently operate in and may further expand into key parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices in addition due to the level of regulation in our industry our operations in certain jurisdictions including china india south america and the middle east require substantial government contact either directly by us or through intermediaries over whom we have less direct control such as subcontractors agents and partners such as joint venture partners where norms can differ from us standards although we have implemented policies procedures and in certain cases contractual arrangements designed to facilitate compliance with these antibribery laws our officers directors associates subcontractors agents and partners may take actions in violation of our policies procedures contractual arrangements and antibribery laws any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could subject us and such persons to criminal andor civil penalties or other sanctions potentially by government prosecutors from more than one country which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and reputation 

environmental obligations and liabilities could have a substantial negative impact on our business financial condition and results of operations  

our operations involve the use handling generation processing storage transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations at the national state local and international levels these environmental laws and regulations include those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the use management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites and occupational health and safety as we expand our business into foreign jurisdictions worldwide our environmental compliance burden may continue to increase both in terms of magnitude and complexity we have incurred and may continue to incur significant costs in complying with these laws and regulations in addition violations of or liabilities under environmental laws or permits may result in restrictions being imposed on our operating activities or in our being subject to substantial fines penalties criminal proceedings thirdparty property damage or personal injury claims cleanup costs or other costs such solutions could also result in substantial delay or termination of projects under construction within our systems business which could adversely impact our results of operations while we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements future developments such as more aggressive enforcement policies the implementation of new more stringent laws and regulations or the discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our solar modules contain cdte and other semiconductor materials elemental cadmium and certain of its compounds are regulated as hazardous materials due to the adverse health effects that may arise from human exposure based on existing research the risks of exposure to cdte are not believed to be as serious as those relating to exposure to elemental cadmium in our manufacturing operations we maintain engineering controls to minimize our associates’ exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds and require our associates who handle cadmium compounds to follow certain safety 

 38 

procedures including the use of personal protective equipment such as respirators chemical goggles and protective clothing relevant studies and thirdparty peer review of our technology have concluded that the risk of exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds from our endproducts is negligible in addition the risk of exposure is further minimized by the encapsulated nature of these materials in our products the physical properties of cadmium compounds used in our products and the recycling or responsible disposal of our modules while we believe that these factors and procedures are sufficient to protect our associates endusers and the general public from adverse health effects that may arise from cadmium exposure we cannot ensure that human or environmental exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds used in our products will not occur any such exposure could result in future thirdparty claims against us damage to our reputation and heightened regulatory scrutiny which could limit or impair our ability to sell and distribute our products the occurrence of future events such as these could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the use of cadmium or cadmium compounds in various products is also coming under increasingly stringent governmental regulation future regulation in this area could impact the manufacturing sale collection and recycling of solar modules and could require us to make unforeseen environmental expenditures or limit our ability to sell and distribute our products for example european union directive 201165eu on the restriction of the use of hazardous substances “rohs” in electrical and electronic equipment the “rohs directive” restricts the use of certain hazardous substances including cadmium and its compounds in specified products other jurisdictions such as china have adopted similar legislation or are considering doing so currently pv solar modules are explicitly excluded from the scope of rohs article 2 as adopted by the european parliament and the council in june 2011 the next general review of the rohs directive is scheduled for 2021 involving a broader discussion of the existing scope a scope review focusing on additional exclusions was proposed by the european commission in 2017 under the eu’s codecision process which allows the european parliament and the european council to amend the european commission’s proposal on exclusions the codecision procedure was completed in 2017 and the existing exclusion of pv modules was maintained in preparation for the next rohs revision the european commission has started a number of preregulatory studies and assessments relating to the addition of new substances to the existing rohs framework as well as the revision and optimization of the exemption process it is unclear to what extent the existing scope exclusions will be discussed or maintained in future directives if pv modules were to be included in the scope of future rohs revisions without an exemption or exclusion we would be required to redesign our solar modules to reduce cadmium and other affected hazardous substances to the maximum allowable concentration thresholds in the rohs directive in order to continue to offer them for sale within the eu as such actions would be impractical this type of regulatory development would effectively close the eu market to us which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as an owner and operator of pv solar power systems that deliver electricity to the grid certain of our affiliated entities may be regulated as public utilities under us federal and state law which could adversely affect the cost of doing business and limit our growth  

as an owner and operator of pv solar power systems that deliver electricity to the grid certain of our affiliated entities may be considered public utilities for purposes of the federal power act as amended the “fpa” and public utility companies for purposes of the public utility holding company act of 2005 “puhca 2005” and are subject to regulation by the ferc as well as various local and state regulatory bodies some of our affiliated entities may be exempt wholesale generators or qualifying facilities under the public utility regulatory policies act of 1978 as amended “purpa” and as such are exempt from regulation under puhca 2005 in addition our affiliated entities may be exempt from most provisions of the fpa as well as state laws regarding the financial or organizational regulation of public utilities we are not directly subject to ferc regulation under the fpa however we are considered to be a “holding company” for purposes of section 203 of the fpa which regulates certain transactions involving public utilities and such regulation could adversely affect our ability to grow the business through acquisitions likewise investors seeking to acquire our public utility subsidiaries or acquire ownership interests in our securities sufficient to give them control over us and our public utility subsidiaries may require prior ferc approval to do so such approval could result in transaction delays or uncertainties 

 39 

public utilities under the fpa are required to obtain ferc acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of electricity and to comply with various regulations the ferc may grant our affiliated entities the authority to sell electricity at marketbased rates and may also grant them certain regulatory waivers such as waivers from compliance with ferc’s accounting regulations these ferc orders reserve the right to revoke or revise marketbased sales authority if the ferc subsequently determines that our affiliated entities can exercise market power in the sale of generation products the provision of transmission services or if it finds that any of the entities can create barriers to entry by competitors in addition if the entities fail to comply with certain reporting obligations the ferc may revoke their power sales tariffs finally if the entities were deemed to have engaged in manipulative or deceptive practices concerning their power sales transactions they would be subject to potential fines disgorgement of profits andor suspension or revocation of their marketbased rate authority if our affiliated entities were to lose their marketbased rate authority such companies would be required to obtain the ferc’s acceptance of a costofservice rate schedule and could become subject to the accounting recordkeeping and reporting requirements that are imposed on utilities with costbased rate schedules which would impose cost and compliance burdens on us and have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition to the risks described above we may be subject to additional regulatory regimes at state or foreign levels to the extent we own and operate pv solar power systems in such jurisdictions 

other risks 

we are subject to litigation risks including securities class actions and stockholder derivative actions which may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain 

from time to time we are subject to legal claims with and without merit that may be costly and which may divert the attention of our management and our resources in general in addition our projects may be subject to litigation or other adverse proceedings that may adversely impact our ability to proceed with construction or sell a given project the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict moreover many of the complaints filed against us do not specify the amount of damages that plaintiffs seek and we therefore are unable to estimate the possible range of damages that might be incurred should these lawsuits be resolved against us certain of these lawsuits assert types of claims that if resolved against us could give rise to substantial damages and an unfavorable outcome or settlement of one or more of these lawsuits or any future lawsuits may result in a significant monetary judgment or award against us or a significant monetary payment by us and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations even if these lawsuits or any future lawsuits are not resolved against us the costs of defending such lawsuits and of any settlement may be significant these costs may exceed the dollar limits of our insurance policies or may not be covered at all by our insurance policies because the price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile we can provide no assurance that additional securities or other litigation will not be filed against us in the future see note 15 “commitments and contingencies – legal proceedings”  to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our legal proceedings including our securities class action and derivative actions 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future business combinations or acquisition transactions and integration of business combinations may disrupt our business and management 

we have made several acquisitions in prior years and in the future we may acquire additional companies project pipelines products or technologies or enter into joint ventures or other strategic initiatives we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such business combinations or acquisitions and each transaction has numerous risks which may include the following 

 

 



 40 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mergers and acquisitions of companies are inherently risky and ultimately if we do not complete the integration of acquired businesses successfully and in a timely manner we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions to the extent anticipated which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations in addition we may seek to dispose of our interests in acquired companies project pipelines products or technologies we may not recover our initial investment in such interests in part or at all which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our future success depends on our ability to retain our key associates and to successfully integrate them into our management team 

we are dependent on the services of our executive officers and other members of our senior management team the loss of one or more of these key associates or any other member of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business we may not be able to retain or replace these key associates and may not have adequate succession plans in place several of our current key associates including our executive officers are subject to employment conditions or arrangements that contain postemployment noncompetition provisions however these arrangements permit the associates to terminate their employment with us upon little or no notice 

 41 

if we are unable to attract train and retain key personnel our business may be materially and adversely affected 

our future success depends to a significant extent on our ability to attract train and retain management operations sales training and technical personnel including personnel in foreign jurisdictions recruiting and retaining capable personnel particularly those with expertise in the pv solar industry across a variety of technologies are vital to our success there is substantial competition for qualified technical personnel and while we continue to benchmark our organization against the broad spectrum of business in our market space to remain economically competitive there can be no assurances that we will be able to attract and retain our technical personnel if we are unable to attract and retain qualified associates or otherwise experience unexpected labor disruptions within our business we may be materially and adversely affected 

we may be exposed to infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties which if determined adversely to us could cause us to pay significant damage awards or prohibit us from the manufacture and sale of our solar modules or the use of our technology 

our success depends largely on our ability to use and develop our technology and knowhow without infringing or misappropriating the intellectual property rights of third parties the validity and scope of claims relating to pv solar technology patents involve complex scientific legal and factual considerations and analysis and therefore may be highly uncertain we may be subject to litigation involving claims of patent infringement or violation of intellectual property rights of third parties the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits patent opposition proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings can be both costly and time consuming and may significantly divert the efforts and resources of our technical and management personnel an adverse determination in any such litigation or proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liability to third parties require us to seek licenses from third parties which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all or pay ongoing royalties require us to redesign our solar modules or subject us to injunctions prohibiting the manufacture and sale of our solar modules or the use of our technologies protracted litigation could also result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of our solar modules until the resolution of such litigation 

currency translation and transaction risk may negatively affect our results of operations 

although our reporting currency is the us dollar we conduct certain business and incur costs in the local currency of most countries in which we operate as a result we are subject to currency translation and transaction risk for example certain of our net sales in 2018  were denominated in foreign currencies such as japanese yen and indian rupees  and we expect to continue to have net sales denominated in foreign currencies in the future joint ventures or other business arrangements with strategic partners outside of the united states have involved and in the future may involve significant investments denominated in local currencies changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar could affect our results of operations and result in exchange gains or losses we cannot accurately predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations 

we could also expand our business into emerging markets many of which have an uncertain regulatory environment relating to currency policy conducting business in such emerging markets could cause our exposure to changes in exchange rates to increase due to the relatively high volatility associated with emerging market currencies and potentially longer payment terms for our proceeds 

our ability to hedge foreign currency exposure is dependent on our credit profile with the banks that are willing and able to do business with us deterioration in our credit position or a significant tightening of the credit market conditions could limit our ability to hedge our foreign currency exposures and therefore result in exchange gains or losses 

 42 

our largest stockholder has significant influence over us and his interests may conflict with or differ from interests of other stockholders 

our largest stockholder lukas t walton the “significant stockholder” owned approximately 21  of our outstanding common stock as of december 31 2018  as a result the significant stockholder has substantial influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of our directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions such as mergers tender offers and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets the interests of the significant stockholder could conflict with or differ from interests of other stockholders for example the concentration of ownership held by the significant stockholder could delay defer or prevent a change of control of our company or impede a merger takeover or other business combination which other stockholders may view favorably 

if our longlived assets or project related assets become impaired we may be required to record significant charges to earnings 

we may be required to record significant charges to earnings should we determine that our longlived assets or project related assets are impaired such charges may have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations we review longlived and project related assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable we consider a project commercially viable or recoverable if it is anticipated to be sold for a profit once it is either fully developed or fully constructed or if the expected operating cash flows from future power generation exceed the cost basis of the asset if our projects are not considered commercially viable we would be required to impair the respective assets 

unanticipated changes in our tax provision the enactment of new tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the jurisdictions in which we operate in december 2017 the united states enacted the tax act the changes included in the tax act are broad and complex and the final effects of the tax act may differ from the amounts provided elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k possibly materially due to among other things changes in regulations related to the tax act any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the tax act any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the tax act or actions we may take as a result of the tax act additionally longstanding international tax laws that determine each country’s jurisdictional tax rights in crossborder international trade continue to evolve as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting reporting requirements recommended by the oecd as these and other tax laws and regulations change our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we are subject to potential tax examinations in various jurisdictions and taxing authorities may disagree with our interpretations of us and foreign tax laws and may assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these examinations in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however the outcome of tax examinations cannot be predicted with certainty therefore the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of such examinations could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision which could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

in addition our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure losses of tax holidays changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings among countries with tax holidays or differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process any changes in our effective tax rate may materially and adversely impact our results of operations 

 43 

cyberattacks or other breaches of our information systems or those of third parties with which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations rely on our computer systems hardware software and networks as well as those of third parties with which we do business to securely process store and transmit proprietary confidential and other information including intellectual property we also rely heavily on these information systems to operate our manufacturing lines and pv solar power plants these information systems may be compromised by cyberattacks computer viruses and other events that could be materially disruptive to our business operations and could put the security of our information and that of the third parties with which we do business at risk of misappropriation or destruction in recent years such cyber incidents have become increasingly frequent and sophisticated targeting or otherwise affecting a wide range of companies while we have instituted security measures to minimize the likelihood and impact of a cyber incident there is no assurance that these measures or those of the third parties with which we do business will be adequate in the future if these measures fail valuable information may be lost our manufacturing development construction om and other operations may be disrupted we may be unable to fulfill our customer obligations and our reputation may suffer for example any cyber incident affecting our automated manufacturing lines could adversely affect our ability to produce solar modules or otherwise affect the quality and performance of the modules produced we may also be subject to litigation regulatory action remedial expenses and financial losses beyond the scope or limits of our insurance coverage these consequences of a failure of security measures could individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in or any failure to comply with privacy laws regulations and standards may adversely affect our business 

personal privacy and data security have become significant issues in the united states europe and in many other jurisdictions in which we operate the regulatory framework for privacy and security issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future furthermore federal state or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted and may in the future adopt laws and regulations affecting data privacy all of which may be subject to invalidation by relevant foreign judicial bodies industry organizations also regularly adopt and advocate for new standards in this area 

in the united states these include rules and regulations promulgated or pending under the authority of federal agencies state attorneys general legislatures and consumer protection agencies internationally many jurisdictions in which we operate have established their own data security and privacy legal framework with which we relevant suppliers and customers must comply for example the general data protection regulation a broadbased data privacy regime enacted by the european parliament which became effective in may 2018 imposes new requirements on how we collect process transfer and store personal data and also imposes additional obligations potential penalties and risk upon our business in many jurisdictions enforcement actions and consequences for noncompliance are also rising in addition to government regulation privacy advocates and industry groups may propose new and different selfregulatory standards that either legally or contractually apply to us although we have implemented policies procedures and in certain cases contractual arrangements designed to facilitate compliance with applicable privacy and data security laws and standards any inability or perceived inability to adequately address privacy and security concerns even if unfounded or comply with applicable privacy and data security laws regulations and policies could result in additional fines costs and liabilities to us damage our reputation inhibit sales and adversely affect our business 

our credit agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business 

we may be unable to respond to changes in business and economic conditions engage in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us and obtain additional financing if needed because the senior secured credit facility made available under our amended and restated credit agreement with several financial institutions as lenders and jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent the “revolving credit facility” and certain of our project financing arrangements contain and other future debt agreements may contain covenant restrictions that limit our ability to among other things 

 44 

 

 

 

 

 

under our revolving credit facility and certain of our project financing arrangements we are also subject to certain financial covenants our ability to comply with covenants under our credit agreements is dependent on our future performance or the performance of specifically financed projects which will be subject to many factors some of which are beyond our control including prevailing economic conditions in addition our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under these agreements and any of our other future debt agreements which if not cured or waived could permit the holders thereof to accelerate such debt and could cause crossdefaults under our other facility agreements and the possible acceleration of debt under such agreements as well as crossdefaults under certain of our key project and operational agreements and could also result in requirements to post additional security instruments to secure future obligations in addition certain events that occur within the company or in the industry or the economy as a whole may constitute material adverse effects under these agreements if it is determined that a material adverse effect has occurred the lenders can under certain circumstances restrict future borrowings or accelerate the due date of outstanding amounts if any of our debt is accelerated we may not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt and may experience crossdefaults under our other debt or operational agreements which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

executive overview 

we are a leading global provider of comprehensive pv solar energy solutions we design manufacture and sell pv solar modules with an advanced thin film semiconductor technology and also develop design construct and sell pv solar power systems that primarily use the modules we manufacture additionally we provide om services to system owners we have substantial ongoing rd efforts focused on module and systemlevel innovations we are the world’s largest thin film pv solar module manufacturer and one of the world’s largest pv solar module manufacturers 

certain of our financial results and other key operational developments for the year ended december 31 2018  include the following 

 

 

 

 

market overview 

the solar industry continues to be characterized by intense pricing competition both at the module and system levels in particular module average selling prices in global markets have experienced an accelerated decline in recent years and are expected to continue to decline to some degree in the future in the aggregate we believe manufacturers of solar cells and modules have significant installed production capacity relative to global demand and the ability for additional capacity expansion we believe the solar industry may from time to time experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity exceeds global demand and that such periods will continue to put pressure on pricing we believe the solar industry is currently in such a period due in part to recent developments in china which include feedintariff reductions causing deferment of incountry project development additionally intense competition at the system level may result in an environment in which pricing falls rapidly thereby further increasing demand for solar energy solutions but constraining the ability for project developers epc companies and verticallyintegrated companies such as first solar to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability in light of such market realities we are focusing on our strategies and points of differentiation which include our advanced module and system technologies our manufacturing process our verticallyintegrated business model our financial viability and the sustainability advantage of our modules and systems 

 49 

global solar markets continue to expand and develop in part aided by demand elasticity resulting from declining industry average selling prices both at the module and system levels which make solar energy more affordable we are developing constructing and operating multiple solar projects around the world as we continue to execute on our advancedstage utilityscale project pipeline we expect a significant portion of our future consolidated net sales operating income and cash flows to be derived from such projects we also continue to develop our earlytomidstage project pipeline and evaluate acquisitions of projects to further expand both our earlytomidstage and advancedstage pipelines see the tables under “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – systems project pipeline” for additional information about projects within our advancedstage pipeline 

lower industry module and system pricing which presents challenges for certain module manufacturers particularly manufacturers with higher cost structures is expected to continue to contribute to diversification in global electricity generation and further demand for solar energy solutions over time we believe that solar energy generation will experience widespread adoption as it competes economically with traditional forms of energy generation in the near term however declining average selling prices are expected to adversely affect our results of operations if competitors reduce pricing to levels below their costs bid aggressively low prices for module sale agreements epc agreements and ppas or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time our results of operations could be further adversely affected in certain markets in california and elsewhere an oversupply imbalance at the grid level may further reduce shorttomedium term demand for new solar installations relative to prior years lower ppa pricing and lower margins on module and system sales to such markets however the effects of such imbalance can be mitigated by modern solar power plants that offer a flexible operating profile thereby promoting greater grid stability and enabling a higher penetration of solar energy we continue to mitigate these uncertainties in part by executing on our module technology improvements including our transition to series 6 module manufacturing continuing the development of key markets partnering with grid operators and utility companies and implementing certain other cost reduction initiatives including both manufacturing bos and other operating costs 

we face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules and developers of solar power projects solar module manufacturers compete with one another on price and on several module value attributes including wattage or conversion efficiency energy yield and reliability and developers of systems compete on various factors such as net present value return on equity and lcoe meaning the net present value of a system’s total life cycle costs divided by the quantity of energy that is expected to be produced over the system’s life many crystalline silicon cell and wafer manufacturers continue to transition from lower efficiency bsf multicrystalline cells the legacy technology against which we have generally competed in our markets to higher efficiency perc multicrystalline and monocrystalline cells at competitive cost structures additionally while conventional solar modules including the solar modules we produce are monofacial meaning their ability to produce energy is a function of direct and diffuse irradiance on their front side certain manufacturers of monocrystalline perc modules are pursuing the commercialization of bifacial modules that also capture diffuse irradiance on the back side of a module we believe the cost effective manufacture of bifacial perc modules is being enabled in part by the expansion of inexpensive crystal growth and diamond wire saw capacity in china bifaciality compromises nameplate efficiency but by converting both front and rear side irradiance such technology may improve the overall energy production of a module relative to nameplate efficiency when applied in certain applications which after considering the incremental bos costs could potentially lower the overall lcoe of a system when compared to systems using conventional solar modules including the modules we produce 

we believe we are among the lowest cost module manufacturers in the solar industry on a module cost per watt basis based on publicly available information this cost competitiveness allows us to compete favorably in markets where pricing for modules and fully integrated pv solar power systems is highly competitive our cost competitiveness is based in large part on our module conversion efficiency proprietary manufacturing technology which enables us to produce a cdte module in less than 35  hours using a continuous and highly automated industrial manufacturing process as opposed to a batch process and our focus on operational excellence in addition our cdte modules use approximately 12  of the amount of semiconductor material that is used to manufacture conventional crystalline silicon solar modules the cost of polysilicon is a significant driver of the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules and the timing and rate of change in the cost of silicon feedstock and polysilicon could lead to changes in solar module pricing 

 50 

levels polysilicon costs have declined in recent years and polysilicon consumption per cell has been reduced through various initiatives such as the adoption of diamond wire saw technology contributing to a decline in our relative manufacturing cost competitiveness over conventional crystalline silicon module manufacturers 

given the smaller size sometimes referred to as form factor of our series 4 modules compared to certain types of crystalline silicon modules we may incur higher labor and bos costs associated with the construction of systems using our series 4 modules thus to compete effectively on an lcoe basis our series 4 modules may need to maintain a certain cost advantage per watt compared to crystalline siliconbased modules with larger form factors our next generation series 6 modules have a larger form factor along with better product attributes and a lower manufacturing cost structure accordingly the larger form factor and design of our series 6 modules is expected to reduce the number of electrical connections hardware and labor required for system installation compared to current module technologies including our series 4 modules the resulting cost savings are expected to improve project returns as bos and labor costs represent a significant portion of the overall costs associated with the construction of a typical utilityscale system 

in terms of energy yield in many climates our cdte modules provide a significant energy production advantage over most conventional crystalline silicon solar modules including bsf and perc technologies of equivalent efficiency rating for example our cdte solar modules provide a superior temperature coefficient which results in stronger system performance in typical high insolation climates as the majority of a system’s generation on average occurs when module temperatures are well above 25°c standard test conditions in addition our cdte modules provide a superior spectral response in humid environments where atmospheric moisture alters the solar spectrum relative to laboratory standards our cdte solar modules also provide a better shading response than conventional crystalline silicon solar modules which may lose up to three times as much power as cdte solar modules when shading occurs as a result of these and other factors our pv solar power systems typically produce more annual energy in real world field conditions than competing systems with the same nameplate capacity 

while our modules and systems are generally competitive in cost reliability and performance attributes there can be no guarantee such competitiveness will continue to exist in the future to the same extent or at all any declines in the competitiveness of our products could result in additional margin compression further declines in the average selling prices of our modules and systems erosion in our market share for modules and systems andor declines in overall net sales we continue to focus on enhancing the competitiveness of our solar modules and systems by accelerating progress along our module technology and cost reduction roadmaps continuing to make technological advances at the system level using innovative installation techniques and knowhow and leveraging volume procurement around standardized hardware platforms 

certain trends and uncertainties 

we believe that our operations may be favorably or unfavorably impacted by the following trends and uncertainties that may affect our financial condition and results of operations see item 1a “risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of other risks that may affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our longterm strategic plans are focused on our goal to create longterm shareholder value through a balance of growth profitability and liquidity in executing such plans we are focusing on providing utilityscale pv solar energy solutions using our modules in key geographic markets that we believe have a compelling need for massscale pv electricity including markets throughout the americas the asiapacific region europe and certain other strategic markets additionally we are focusing on opportunities in which our pv solar energy solutions can compete directly with traditional forms of energy generation on an lcoe or similar basis or complement such generation offerings our focus on our core module and utilityscale offerings exists within a current market environment that includes rooftop and distributed generation solar particularly in the united states while it is unclear how rooftop and distributed generation solar might impact our core utilityscale based offerings in the next several years we believe that utilityscale solar will continue to be a compelling solar offering for companies with technology and cost leadership and will continue to represent an increasing portion of the overall electricity generation mix additionally our ability to provide 

 51 

utilityscale offerings on economically attractive terms depends in part on certain market factors outside of our control such as interest rate fluctuations domestic or international trade policies and government support programs adverse changes in these factors could increase the cost of utilityscale systems which could reduce demand for such systems and limit the number of potential buyers 

we are closely evaluating and managing the appropriate level of resources required as we pursue the most advantageous and cost effective projects and partnerships in our key markets we have dedicated and intend to continue to dedicate significant capital and human resources to reduce the total installed cost of pv solar energy to optimize the design and logistics around our pv solar energy solutions and to ensure that our solutions integrate well into the overall electricity ecosystem of each specific market we expect that over time the majority of our consolidated net sales operating income and cash flows will come from solar offerings in the key geographic markets described above the timing execution and financial impacts of our longterm strategic plans are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in item 1a “risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k we are focusing our resources in those markets and energy applications in which solar power can be a leastcost bestfit energy solution particularly in regions with significant current or projected electricity demand relatively high existing electricity prices strong demand for renewable energy generation and high solar resources 

creating or maintaining a market position in certain strategically targeted markets and energy applications also requires us to adapt to new and changing market conditions for example our offerings from time to time may need to be competitively priced at levels associated with minimal gross profit margins which may adversely affect our results of operations we expect the profitability associated with our various sales offerings to vary from one another over time and possibly vary from our internal longrange profitability expectations and targets depending on the market opportunity and the relative competitiveness of our offerings compared with other energy solutions traditional or otherwise that are available to potential customers in addition as we execute on our longterm strategic plans we will continue to monitor and adapt to any changing dynamics in emerging technologies such as commercially viable energy storage solutions which are expected to further enable pv solar power systems to compete with traditional forms of energy generation by shifting the delivery of energy generated by such systems to periods of greater demand storage solutions continue to evolve in terms of technology and cost and cumulative global deployments of storage capacity are expected to exceed 900 gw dc  by 2040 representing a significant increase in the potential market for renewable energy we will also continue to monitor and adapt to changing dynamics in the market set of potential buyers of solar projects market environments with few potential project buyers and a higher cost of capital would generally exert downward pressure on the potential revenue from the solar projects we are developing whereas conversely market environments with many potential project buyers and a lower cost of capital would likely have a favorable impact on the potential revenue from such solar projects 

on occasion we may temporarily own and operate certain systems with the intention to sell them at a later date we may also enter into business arrangements with strategic partners that result in us temporarily retaining an ownership interest in the underlying systems projects we develop supply modules to or construct potentially for a period of up to several years in these situations we may retain such ownership interests in a consolidated or unconsolidated separate entity we may also elect to construct and temporarily retain ownership interests in partially contracted or uncontracted systems for which there is a partial or no ppa with an offtaker such as a utility but rather an intent to sell a portion or all of the electricity produced by the system on an open contract basis until the system is sold expected revenue from projects without a ppa for the full offtake of the system is subject to greater variability and uncertainty based on market factors and is typically lower than projects with a ppa for the full offtake of the system furthermore all system pricing is effected by the pricing of energy to be sold on an open contract basis following the termination of the ppa ie merchant pricing curves and changes in market assumptions regarding future open contract sales may also result in significant variability and uncertainty in the value of our systems projects 

we continually evaluate forecasted global demand competition and our addressable market and seek to effectively balance manufacturing capacity with market demand and the nature and extent of our competition during 2018 we commenced commercial production of series 6 modules at our manufacturing facilities in perrysburg ohio kulim malaysia and our previously idled manufacturing plant in ho chi minh city vietnam in early 2019 we commenced 

 52 

commercial production at our second manufacturing facility in ho chi minh city vietnam we are also in the process of constructing an additional series 6 manufacturing plant in lake township ohio a short distance from our plant in perrysburg ohio these additional manufacturing plants and any other potential investments to add or otherwise modify our existing manufacturing capacity in response to market demand and competition may require significant internal and possibly external sources of liquidity and may be subject to certain risks and uncertainties described in item 1a “risk factors” including those described under the headings “ our future success depends on our ability to effectively balance manufacturing production with market demand convert existing production facilities to support new product lines such as our transition to series 6 module manufacturing and when necessary continue to build new manufacturing plants over time in response to such demand and add production lines in a costeffective manner all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties ” and “ if any future production lines are not built in line with committed schedules it may adversely affect our future growth plans if any future production lines do not achieve operating metrics similar to our existing production lines our solar modules could perform below expectations and cause us to lose customers ” 

systems project pipeline 

the following tables summarize as of february 21 2019  our approximately 26 gw ac  advancedstage project pipeline the actual volume of modules installed in our projects will be greater than the project size in mw ac  as module volumes required for a project are based upon mw dc  which will be greater than the mw ac  size pursuant to a dcac ratio typically ranging from 12 to 13 such ratio varies across different projects due to various system design factors projects are typically removed from our advancedstage project pipeline tables below once we substantially complete construction of the project and after substantially all of the associated project revenue is recognized projects or portions of projects may also be removed from the tables below in the event an epccontracted or partnerdeveloped project does not obtain permitting or financing a project is not able to be sold due to the changing economics of the project or other factors or we decide to temporarily own and operate or retain interests in such projects based on strategic opportunities or market factors

cost of sales   decreased   5405 million  or 23  and increased   12 percentage points  as a percent of net sales when comparing 2018  with 2017  the decrease  in cost of sales was driven by a 3989 million   decrease  in our systems segment cost of sales primarily due to the size of projects sold or under construction and the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria were met the decrease  in cost of sales was also driven by a 1416 million   decrease  in our modules segment cost of sales primarily as a result of the following 

 

cost of sales   increased   1262 million  or 6  and increased   33 percentage points  as a percentage of net sales when comparing 2017  with 2016  the increase  in cost of sales was driven by a 1291 million  increase in our modules segment cost of sales primarily due to the following 

 

gross profit 

gross profit  may be affected by numerous factors including the selling prices of our modules and systems our manufacturing costs project development costs bos costs the capacity utilization of our manufacturing facilities and foreign exchange rates gross profit  may also be affected by the mix of net sales from our modules and systems businesses 

 57 

the following table shows gross profit for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  



gross profit   decreased   12 percentage points  to 175  during 2018  from 187  during 2017  primarily as a result of higher underutilization and certain other charges associated with the initial ramp of series 6 manufacturing lines and the reduction to our product warranty liability in 2017  described above partially offset by the mix of higher gross profit projects sold during the period and the settlement of a tax examination with the state of california which affected our estimates of sales and use taxes due for certain projects 

gross profit   decreased   33 percentage points to 187  during 2017  from 220  during 2016  primarily due to a mix of lower gross profit projects sold and under construction during the period and reductions in the average selling price per watt of our modules sold directly to third parties partially offset by the reductions in our product warranty liability and our module collection and recycling liability described above 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative  expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated costs professional fees insurance costs and other business development and selling expenses 

the following table shows selling general and administrative expense for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  



selling general and administrative  expense in 2018   decreased  compared to 2017  primarily from lower employee compensation expense lower accretion expense associated with the reduction in our module collection and recycling liability described above lower expenses related to project sales and lower business development expense this decrease was partially offset by higher charges for impairments of certain project assets in 2018  selling general and administrative  expense in 2017   decreased  compared to 2016  primarily due to higher impairments of certain project assets in 2016  lower employee compensation expense due to various restructuring activities lower professional fees lower infrastructure related expenses and lower business development expenses 

research and development 

research and development  expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated costs the cost of products materials and outside services used in our rd activities and depreciation and amortization expense associated with rd specific facilities and equipment we maintain a number of programs and activities to improve our technology and processes in order to enhance the performance and reduce the costs of our solar modules and systems 

the following table shows research and development expense for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  



 58 

research and development  expense in 2018   decreased  compared to 2017  primarily due to lower employee compensation expense lower facilities expense and reduced material and module testing costs partially offset by higher impairment charges for certain equipment research and development  expense in 2017   decreased  compared to 2016  primarily due to lower costs for thirdparty contracted services reduced material and module testing costs the termination of certain rd programs for legacy module technologies and lower employee compensation expense resulting from reductions to our headcount as part of various restructuring activities 

production startup 

production startup  expense consists primarily of employee compensation and other costs associated with operating a production line before it has been qualified for full production including the cost of raw materials for solar modules run through the production line during the qualification phase and applicable facility related costs costs related to equipment upgrades and implementation of manufacturing process improvements are also included in production startup expense as well as costs related to the selection of a new site related legal and regulatory costs and costs to maintain our plant replication program to the extent we cannot capitalize these expenditures in general we expect production startup expense per production line to be higher when we build an entirely new manufacturing facility compared with the addition or replacement of production lines at an existing manufacturing facility primarily due to the additional infrastructure investment required when building an entirely new facility 

the following table shows production startup expense for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  



during 2018  we incurred production startup expense for the commencement of series 6 module manufacturing at our facility in ho chi minh city vietnam we also incurred production startup expense for the transition to series 6 module manufacturing at our facilities in kulim malaysia and perrysburg ohio in 2017  and early 2018  

restructuring and asset impairments 

restructuring and asset impairments   consists of expenses incurred related to material restructuring initiatives and includes any associated asset impairments costs for employee termination benefits costs for contract terminations and penalties and other restructuring related costs such restructuring initiatives are intended to align the organization with then current business conditions and to reduce costs 

the following table shows restructuring and asset impairments for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  



in november 2016 our board of directors approved a set of initiatives to accelerate our transition to series 6 module manufacturing and restructure our operations in june 2016 we ended production of our crystalline silicon modules to focus on our core cdte module and utilityscale systems as a result of these decisions we recorded restructuring and asset impairment charges of 418 million  and 7439 million  during 2017  and 2016  respectively in 2017  we also reversed a customs tax liability associated with a prior restructuring activity which reduced our restructuring charges by 47 million  during the period see note 4 “restructuring and asset impairments”  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on these matters 

 59 

goodwill impairment 

the following table shows goodwill impairments for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  



as a result of our annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of 2016 we impaired the remaining 688 million  of goodwill associated with our systems reporting unit primarily due to a strategic shift in the mix of our module and system net sales which was approved by our board of directors in november 2016 as part of the restructuring activities described above this shift involved an expected reduction in the annual megawatts sold through systems business projects other factors that contributed to the impairment included our reduced market capitalization and the challenging conditions within the solar industry as of the date of our testing in june 2016 we also impaired the remaining 61 million  of goodwill associated with our crystalline silicon modules reporting unit due to the decision to end the related manufacturing operations as further described above see note 6 “goodwill and intangible assets”  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

foreign currency loss net 

foreign currency loss net  consists of the net effect of gains and losses resulting from holding assets and liabilities and conducting transactions denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries’ functional currencies 

the following table shows foreign currency loss net for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  



foreign currency loss net   decreased  in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily due to lower costs associated with hedging activities related to our subsidiaries in japan india and europe foreign currency loss net   decreased  in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily as a result of lower costs associated with hedging activities related to our subsidiaries in india the weakening of the us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies and differences between our economic hedge positions and the underlying exposures 

interest income 

interest income  is earned on our cash cash equivalents marketable securities and restricted cash and investments interest income also includes interest earned from notes receivable and late customer payments 

the following table shows interest income for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  



interest income during 2018   increased  compared to 2017  primarily as a result of higher time deposit balances and increased interest rates associated with cash cash equivalents and marketable securities partially offset by lower balances of cash and cash equivalents interest income during 2017   increased  compared to 2016  primarily due to higher cash balances during the period higher interest rates associated with such cash balances and a promissory note with an affiliate issued in late 2016  

 60 

interest expense net 

interest expense is primarily comprised of interest incurred on longterm debt settlements of interest rate swap contracts and changes in the fair value of interest rate swap contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 815 we may capitalize interest expense into our project assets or property plant and equipment when such costs qualify for interest capitalization which reduces the amount of net interest expense reported in any given period 

the following table shows interest expense net for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  



interest expense net increased  in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily due to changes in the fair value of interest rate swap contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting and higher levels of project specific debt financings partially offset by higher interest costs capitalized to certain projects under construction interest expense net increased  in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to changes in the fair value of interest rate swap contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting and higher levels of project specific debt financings partially offset by lower interest expense associated with certain malaysian credit facilities that were fully repaid in 2016  

other income net 

other income net  is primarily comprised of miscellaneous items and realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities and restricted investments 

the following table shows other income net for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  



other income net   increased  in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily due to realized gains of 554 million  in 2018  from the sale of certain restricted investments partially offset by a 268 million  settlement from the resolution of an outstanding matter with a former customer in 2017  and higher withholding taxes on certain payments by our foreign subsidiaries 

other income net   decreased  in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to realized gains of 413 million  in 2016  from the sale of certain restricted investments and a 74 million  reversal of the outstanding contingent consideration associated with our tetrasun acquisition as a result of our crystalline silicon module manufacturing restructuring in 2016  partially offset by the customer settlement in 2017  described above 

income tax expense   

in december 2017 the us president signed into law the tax act which significantly revised us tax law by among other things lowering the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 eliminating certain deductions imposing a transition tax on certain accumulated earnings and profits of foreign corporate subsidiaries the “transition tax” introducing new tax regimes and changing how foreign earnings are subject to us tax during 2017 we recognized certain provisional tax expenses associated with the tax act we completed our accounting for the tax act in the fourth quarter of 2018 and recorded certain adjustments to our provisional tax expenses 

income tax expense or benefit deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect our best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and 

 61 

numerous foreign jurisdictions in which we operate principally australia india and malaysia significant judgments and estimates are required to determine our consolidated income tax expense the statutory federal corporate income tax rate in the united states decreased from 35  to 21  beginning in january 2018 the tax rates in australia india and malaysia are 30  349  and 24  respectively in malaysia we have been granted a longterm tax holiday scheduled to expire in 2027  pursuant to which substantially all of our income earned in malaysia is exempt from income tax conditional upon our continued compliance with certain employment and investment thresholds 

the following table shows income tax expense for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  



our tax rate is affected by recurring items such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions the rate is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from period to period income tax expense decreased  by 3686 million  during 2018  compared to 2017  primarily due to provisional tax expense of 4081 million  in 2017 related to the tax act and lower pretax income partially offset by income earned in certain higher tax jurisdictions and a 421 million  discrete tax benefit in 2017 associated with the acceptance of our election to classify certain of our german subsidiaries as disregarded entities of first solar inc 

income tax expense increased  by 3488 million  during 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to provisional tax expense related to the tax act as described above higher pretax income a 354 million  reversal of an uncertain tax position in 2016 related to the income of a foreign subsidiary and lower excess tax benefits associated with sharebased compensation partially offset by certain us taxes in 2016 on a cash distribution received from a foreign subsidiary and a 421 million  discrete tax benefit as described above see note 19 “income taxes”  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

equity in earnings net of tax 

equity in earnings net of tax   represents our proportionate share of the earnings or losses from equity method investments as well as any gains or losses on the sale or disposal of such investments 

the following table shows equity in earnings net of tax for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  



equity in earnings net of tax   increased  in 2018  compared to 2017  primarily due to the sale of our ownership interests in 8point3 operating company llc “opco” in june 2018  which resulted in a gain of 403 million  net of tax see note 12 “equity method investments”  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information equity in earnings net of tax   decreased  in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to the recognition of a gain of 1251 million  net of tax in december 2016  from the sale of our residual interest in the desert stateline project to opco and lower equity in earnings from our investment in opco 

 62 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2018  we believe that our cash cash equivalents marketable securities cash flows from operating activities advancedstage project pipeline availability under our revolving credit facility considering the minimum liquidity covenant requirements therein and access to the capital markets will be sufficient to meet our working capital systems project investment and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months we monitor our working capital to ensure we have adequate liquidity both domestically and internationally 

we intend to maintain appropriate debt levels based upon cash flow expectations our overall cost of capital and expected cash requirements for operations capital expenditures and strategic discretionary spending in the future we may also engage in additional debt or equity financings including project specific debt financings we believe that when necessary we will have adequate access to the capital markets although our ability to raise capital on terms commercially acceptable to us could be constrained if there is insufficient lender or investor interest due to industrywide or companyspecific concerns such financings could result in increased debt service expenses dilution to our existing stockholders or restrictive covenants which could restrain our ability to pursue our strategic plans 

as of december 31 2018  we had 25 billion  in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities compared to 30 billion  as of december 31 2017  cash cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december 31 2018  decreased primarily as a result of purchases of property plant and equipment and operating expenditures associated with the initial ramp of certain series 6 manufacturing lines partially offset by proceeds associated with the sale of our interests in 8point3 and its subsidiaries and net proceeds from borrowings under project specific debt financings as of december 31 2018  and 2017  12 billion  and 16 billion  respectively of our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries and was primarily based in us dollar euro and japanese yen denominated holdings 

we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed if certain international funds were needed for our operations in the united states we may be required to accrue and pay certain us and foreign taxes to repatriate such funds we maintain the intent and ability to permanently reinvest our accumulated earnings outside of the united states with the exception of our subsidiaries in canada and germany in addition changes to foreign government banking regulations may restrict our ability to move funds among various jurisdictions under certain circumstances which could negatively impact our access to capital resulting in an adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources 

our systems business requires significant liquidity and is expected to continue to have significant liquidity requirements in the future the net amount of our project assets and related portion of deferred revenue which approximates our net capital investment in the development and construction of systems projects was 4673 million  as of december 31 2018  solar power project development and construction cycles which span the time between the identification of a site location and the commercial operation of a system vary substantially and can take many years to mature as a result of these long project cycles and strategic decisions to finance the construction of certain projects using our working capital we may need to make significant upfront investments of resources in advance of the receipt of any cash from the sale of such projects delays in construction or in completing the sale of our systems projects that we are selffinancing may also impact our liquidity in certain circumstances we may need to finance construction costs exclusively using working capital if project financing becomes unavailable due to marketwide regional or other concerns 

from time to time we may develop projects in certain markets around the world where we may hold all or a significant portion of the equity in a project for several years given the duration of these investments and the currency risk relative to the us dollar in some of these markets we continue to explore local financing alternatives should these financing alternatives be unavailable or too cost prohibitive we could be exposed to significant currency risk and our liquidity could be adversely impacted 

additionally we may elect to retain an ownership interest in certain systems projects after they become operational if we determine it would be of economic and strategic benefit to do so if for example we cannot sell a systems project 

 63 

at economics that are attractive to us or potential customers are unwilling to assume the risks and rewards typical of pv solar power system ownership we may instead elect to temporarily own and operate such systems until we can sell the systems on economically attractive terms the decision to retain ownership of a system impacts liquidity depending upon the size and cost of the project as of december 31 2018  we had 3086 million  of net pv solar power systems that had been placed in service primarily in international markets we have elected and may in the future elect to enter into temporary or longterm project financing to reduce the impact on our liquidity and working capital with regards to such projects and systems we may also consider entering into tax equity or other arrangements with respect to ownership interests in certain of our projects which could cause a portion of the economics of such projects to be realized over time 

the following additional considerations have impacted or may impact our liquidity in 2019  and beyond

cash flows 

the following table summarizes key cash flow activity for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  in thousands 



operating activities 

the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities during 2018 was primarily driven by lower cash proceeds from sales of systems projects including the sales of the moapa california flats switch station and cuyama projects in 2017 higher liabilities assumed by customers as part of the consideration for certain projects sold and operating expenditures associated with our ongoing transition to series 6 module manufacturing the increase in net cash provided by operating activities during 2017  was primarily driven by the sale of the projects described above partially offset by expenditures for the construction of certain projects 

investing activities 

the increase in net cash used in investing activities during 2018  was primarily due to higher purchases of property plant and equipment driven by our transition to series 6 module manufacturing and an increase in net purchases of marketable securities and restricted investments partially offset by proceeds associated with the sale of our interests in 8point3 and its subsidiaries the increase in net cash used in investing activities during 2017  was primarily due to i proceeds from sales of equity method investments in 2016  including the sale of our remaining interest in the desert stateline project ii an increase in purchases of property plant and equipment driven by our transition to series 6 module manufacturing and iii net higher net purchases of marketable securities and restricted investments 

financing activities 

the increase in net cash provided by financing activities during 2018  was primarily the result of higher net proceeds from borrowings under longterm debt arrangements associated with the construction of certain projects in australia japan and india and lower payments for contingent obligations associated with the acquisition of certain projects in japan partially offset by lower proceeds from commercial letters of credit for the construction of certain projects in india the increase in net cash provided by financing activities during 2017  was primarily the result of net proceeds from borrowings under longterm debt arrangements associated with the construction of certain projects in japan india and australia and proceeds from commercial letters of credit for the construction of certain projects in india

we have excluded 722 million  of unrecognized tax benefits from the amounts presented above as the timing of such obligations is uncertain 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2018  we had no offbalance sheet debt or similar obligations other than financial assurance related instruments and operating leases which are not classified as debt we do not guarantee any thirdparty debt see note 15 “commitments and contingencies”  to our consolidated financial statements for further information about our financial assurance related instruments

critical accounting estimates 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “us gaap” we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of reported assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment in the selection of the appropriate assumptions for making these estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty we base our judgments and estimates on our historical experience our forecasts and other available information as appropriate the actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results our future results of operations will be affected our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies”  to our consolidated financial statements the accounting policies that require the most significant judgment and estimates include the following 

revenue recognition – solar power system sales andor epc services  we generally recognize revenue for sales of solar power systems andor epc services over time as our performance creates or enhances an energy generation asset controlled by the customer furthermore the sale of a solar power system when combined with epc services represents a single performance obligation for the development and construction of a single generation asset for such sale arrangements we recognize revenue using cost based input methods which recognize revenue and gross profit as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred compared to the total estimated costs of the contract  for sales of solar power systems in which we obtain an interest in the project sold to the customer we recognize all of the revenue for the consideration received including the fair value of the noncontrolling interest we obtained and defer any profit associated with the interest obtained through “ equity in earnings net of tax ” we may also recognize revenue for the sale of a solar power system after it has been completed due to the timing of when we enter into the associated sales contract with the customer 

estimating the fair value of a noncontrolling interest we obtain begins with the valuation of the entire solar project ie solar power system being sold to the customer such valuation generally uses an income based valuation technique in which relevant cash flows are discounted to estimate the expected economic earnings capacity of the project typical factors considered in a project’s valuation include expected energy generation the duration and pricing of the ppa the pricing of energy to be sold on an open contract basis following the termination of the ppa ie merchant pricing curves other offtake agreements the useful life of the system tax attributes such as accelerated depreciation and tax credits sales of renewable energy certificates interconnection rights operating agreements and the cost of capital once the overall project valuation is agreed upon with the customer we determine the relative value related to our specific ownership interests conveyed through the transaction agreements including the membership interest purchase and sale agreement and the limited liability company agreement or equivalent of the project or its holding company 

in applying cost based input methods of revenue recognition we use the actual costs incurred relative to the total estimated costs including solar module costs to determine our progress towards contract completion and to calculate the corresponding amount of revenue and gross profit to recognize cost based input methods of revenue recognition are considered a faithful depiction of our efforts to satisfy longterm construction contracts and therefore reflect the transfer of goods to a customer under such contracts costs incurred that do not contribute to satisfying our performance obligations “inefficient costs” are excluded from our input methods of revenue recognition as the amounts are not reflective of our transferring control of the system to the customer costs incurred towards contract completion may include costs associated with solar modules direct materials labor subcontractors and other indirect costs related to contract performance we recognize solar module and direct material costs as incurred when such items have been installed in a system cost based input methods of revenue recognition require us to make estimates of net contract revenues and costs to complete our projects in making such estimates significant judgment is required to evaluate assumptions related to the amount of net contract revenues including the impact of any performance incentives liquidated damages and other payments to customers significant judgment is also required to evaluate assumptions related to the costs to complete our projects including materials labor contingencies and other system costs 

 67 

if the estimated total costs on any contract including any inefficient costs are greater than the net contract revenues we recognize the entire estimated loss in the period the loss becomes known the cumulative effect of revisions to estimates related to net contract revenues or costs to complete contracts are recorded in the period in which the revisions to estimates are identified and the amounts can be reasonably estimated the effect of the changes on future periods are recognized as if the revised estimates had been used since revenue was initially recognized under the contract such revisions could occur in any reporting period and the effects may be material depending on the size of the contracts or the changes in estimates 

as part of our solar power system sales we conduct performance testing of a system prior to substantial completion to confirm the system meets its operational and capacity expectations noted in the epc agreement in addition we may provide an energy performance test during the first or second year of a system’s operation to demonstrate that the actual energy generation for the applicable period meets or exceeds the modeled energy expectation after certain adjustments these tests are based on meteorological energy and equipment performance data measured at the system’s location as well as certain projections of such data over the remaining measurement period in certain instances a bonus payment may be received at the end of the applicable test period if the system performs above a specified level conversely if there is an underperformance event with regards to these tests we may incur liquidated damages as a percentage of the epc contract price such performance guarantees represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data becomes available and only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of any incremental revenue will not occur 

revenue recognition – operations and maintenance we recognize revenue for standard recurring om services over time as customers receive and consume the benefits of such services costs of om services are expensed in the period in which they are incurred as part of our om service offerings we typically offer an effective availability guarantee which stipulates that a system will be available to generate a certain percentage of total possible energy during a specific period after adjusting for factors outside of our control as the service provider these tests are based on meteorological energy and equipment performance data measured at the system’s location as well as certain projections of such data over the remaining measurement period if system availability exceeds a contractual threshold we may receive a bonus payment or if system availability falls below a separate threshold we may incur liquidated damages for certain lost energy under the ppa such bonuses or liquidated damages represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated and recognized over time as customers receive and consume the benefits of the om services 

accrued solar module collection and recycling liability  when applicable we recognize expense at the time of sale for the estimated cost of our obligations to collect and recycle solar modules covered by our solar module collection and recycling program we estimate the cost of our collection and recycling obligations based on the present value of the expected probabilityweighted future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules which includes estimates for the cost of packaging materials the cost of freight from the solar module installation sites to a recycling center material labor and capital costs the scale of recycling centers and an estimated thirdparty profit margin and return on risk for collection and recycling services we base these estimates on i our experience collecting and recycling our solar modules ii the expected timing of when our solar modules will be returned for recycling and iii the expected economic factors at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled in the periods between the time of sale and the related settlement of the collection and recycling obligation we accrete the carrying amount of the associated liability by applying the discount rate used for its initial measurement we periodically review our estimates of expected future recycling costs and may adjust our liability accordingly 

product warranties we provide a limited pv solar module warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for approximately 10  years we also typically warrant that modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 98  of their labeled power output rating during the first year with the warranty coverage reducing by 05  every year thereafter throughout the approximate 25 year limited power output warranty period 

 68 

as an alternative form of our standard limited module power output warranty we also offer an aggregated or systemlevel limited module performance warranty this systemlevel limited module performance warranty is designed for utilityscale systems and provides 25 year systemlevel energy degradation protection this warranty represents a practical expedient to address the challenge of identifying from the potential millions of modules installed in a utilityscale system individual modules that may be performing below warranty thresholds by focusing on the aggregate energy generated by the system rather than the power output of individual modules the systemlevel limited module performance warranty is typically calculated as a percentage of a system’s expected energy production adjusted for certain actual site conditions with the warranted level of performance declining each year in a linear fashion but never falling below 80  during the term of the warranty 

in addition to our limited solar module warranties described above for pv solar power systems we construct we typically provide limited warranties for defects in engineering design installation and bos part workmanship for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a system or a block within the system 

when we recognize revenue for module or system sales we accrue liabilities for the estimated future costs of meeting our limited warranty obligations we make and revise these estimates based primarily on the number of our solar modules under warranty installed at customer locations our historical experience with warranty claims our monitoring of field installation sites our internal testing of and the expected future performance of our solar modules and bos parts and our estimated permodule replacement costs as a result of such factors we estimate our limited product warranties based on warranty return rates of approximately 1  to 3  for modules covered under warranty depending on the series of module technology 

income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the united states its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations such tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant taxing authorities we make judgments and interpretations regarding the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining our provision for income taxes and also make estimates about when in the future certain items are expected to affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions disputes over interpretations of tax laws may be settled with the relevant taxing authority upon examination or audit we regularly evaluate the likelihood of assessments in each of our taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and future examinations and we record tax liabilities as appropriate 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements we calculate our income tax provision based on our interpretation of the tax laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business this requires us to estimate our current tax obligations assess uncertain tax positions and assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities we must also assess the likelihood that each of our deferred tax assets will be realized to the extent we believe that realization of any of our deferred tax assets is not more likely than not we establish a valuation allowance when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a reporting period we generally record a corresponding tax expense conversely to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed which generally reduces our overall income tax expense 

we establish liabilities for potential additional taxes based on our assessment of the outcome of our tax positions once established we adjust these liabilities when additional information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring an adjustment significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the actual cost of a tax assessment fine or penalty may ultimately be materially different from our recorded liabilities if any 

we continually explore initiatives to better align our tax and legal entity structure with the footprint of our global operations and recognize the tax impact of these initiatives including changes in the assessment of uncertain tax positions indefinite reinvestment exception assertions and the realizability of deferred tax assets in the period when we believe all necessary internal and external approvals associated with such initiatives have been obtained or when the initiatives are materially complete 

 69 

asset impairments  we assess longlived assets classified as “held and used” including our property plant and equipment project assets pv solar power systems and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances arise including consideration of technological obsolescence that may indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable and these assessments require significant judgment in determining whether such events or changes have occurred relevant considerations may include a significant decrease in the market price of a longlived asset a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset is being used or in its physical condition a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of a longlived asset an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a longlived asset a currentperiod operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of such losses or a projection of future losses associated with the use of a longlived asset or a current expectation that more likely than not a longlived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss longlived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and we must also exercise judgment in assessing such groupings and levels 

when impairment indicators are present we compare undiscounted future cash flows including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value to the asset group’s carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset group to its carrying value fair value is generally determined by considering i internally developed discounted cash flows for the asset group ii thirdparty valuations andor iii information available regarding the current market value for such assets if the fair value of an asset group is determined to be less than its carrying value an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and such projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized 

goodwill  goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the estimated fair value assigned to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed we do not amortize goodwill but instead are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually we perform impairment tests between the scheduled annual test in the fourth quarter if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill is less than its carrying value 

we may first make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test such qualitative impairment test considers various factors including macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors the overall financial performance of a reporting unit and any other relevant events affecting our company or a reporting unit if we determine through the qualitative assessment that a reporting unit’s fair value is more likely than not greater than its carrying value the quantitative impairment test is not required if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value we perform a quantitative impairment test we may also elect to proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test without considering qualitative factors 

the quantitative impairment test is the comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill our reporting units consist of our modules business and our fully integrated systems business we define the fair value of a reporting unit as the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date we primarily use an income approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units significant judgment is required when estimating the fair value of a reporting unit including the forecasting of future operating results and the selection of discount and expected future growth rates used to determine projected cash flows if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is not impaired and no further analysis is required conversely if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value we record an impairment loss equal to the excess not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency exchange risk 

cash flow exposure  we expect certain of our subsidiaries to have future cash flows that will be denominated in currencies other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies changes in the exchange rates between the functional currencies of our subsidiaries and the other currencies in which they transact will cause fluctuations in the cash flows we expect to receive or pay when these cash flows are realized or settled accordingly we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of these forecasted cash flows these foreign exchange forward contracts qualify for accounting as cash flow hedges in accordance with asc 815 and we designated them as such we initially report the effective portion of a derivative’s unrealized gain or loss in “ accumulated other comprehensive loss income ” and subsequently reclassify amounts into earnings when the hedged transaction occurs and impacts earnings for additional details on our derivative hedging instruments and activities see note 10 “derivative financial instruments”  to our consolidated financial statements 

certain of our international operations such as our manufacturing facilities in malaysia and vietnam pay a portion of their operating expenses including associate wages and utilities in local currencies which exposes us to foreign currency exchange risk for such expenses our manufacturing facilities are also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk for purchases of certain equipment from international vendors as we expand into new markets worldwide particularly emerging markets our total foreign currency exchange risk in terms of both size and exchange rate volatility and the number of foreign currencies we are exposed to could increase significantly 

for the year ended december 31 2018  23  of our net sales were denominated in foreign currencies including japanese yen and indian rupees  as a result we have exposure to foreign currencies with respect to our net sales which has historically represented one of our primary foreign currency exchange risks a 10 change in the us dollar to japanese yen and us dollar to indian rupee exchange rates would have had an aggregate impact on our net sales of 384 million  excluding the effect of our hedging activities 

transaction exposure many of our subsidiaries have assets and liabilities primarily cash receivables marketable securities deferred taxes payables accrued expenses and solar module collection and recycling liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies changes in the exchange rates between the functional currencies of our subsidiaries and the other currencies in which these assets and liabilities are denominated will create fluctuations in our reported consolidated statements of operations and cash flows we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other financial instruments to economically hedge assets and liabilities against the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations the gains and losses on such foreign exchange forward contracts will economically offset all or part of the transaction gains and losses that we recognize in earnings on the related foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities for additional details on our economic hedging instruments and activities see note 10 “derivative financial instruments”  to our consolidated financial statements 

as of december 31 2018  a 10 change in the us dollar to vietnamese dong exchange rate which represented one of our primary foreign currency exposures would impact our net foreign currency loss by 28 million  including the effect of our hedging activities 

interest rate risk 

variable rate debt exposure we are exposed to interest rate risk as certain of our project specific debt financings have variable interest rates exposing us to variability in interest expense and cash flows see note 14 “debt”  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our longterm debt borrowing rates an increase in relevant interest rates would increase the cost of borrowing under certain of our project specific debt financings if such variable interest rates changed by 100 basis points our interest expense for the year ended december 31 2018  would have changed by 10 million  including the effect of our hedging activities 

 71 

customer financing exposure  we are also indirectly exposed to interest rate risk because many of our customers depend on debt financings to purchase modules or systems an increase in interest rates could make it challenging for our customers to obtain the capital necessary to make such purchases on favorable terms or at all such factors could reduce demand or lower the price we can charge for our modules and systems thereby reducing our net sales and gross profit in addition we believe that a significant percentage of our customers purchase systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt an increase in interest rates could lower an investor’s return on investment in a system or make alternative investments more attractive relative to pv solar power systems which in either case could cause these endusers to seek alternative investments with higher returns 

marketable securities and restricted investments exposure  we invest in various debt securities which exposes us to interest rate risk the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal and provide liquidity while at the same time maximizing the return on our investments many of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk accordingly a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the market value of such investments to fluctuate for example if we hold a security that was issued with an interest rate fixed at the thenprevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate subsequently rises the market value of our investment may decline 

for the year ended december 31 2018  our marketable securities earned a return of 2  including the impact of fluctuations in the price of the underlying securities and had a weightedaverage maturity of 5 months  as of the end of the period based on our investment positions as of december 31 2018  a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would have resulted in a 32 million  change in the market value of our investment portfolio for the year ended december 31 2018  our restricted investments earned a return of 4  including the impact of fluctuations in the price of the underlying securities and had a weightedaverage maturity of approximately 13  years as of the end of the period based on our restricted investment positions as of december 31 2018  a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would have resulted in a 294 million  change in the market value of our restricted investment portfolio 

commodity and component risk 

we are exposed to price risks for the raw materials components services and energy costs used in the manufacturing and transportation of our solar modules and bos parts used in our systems also some of our raw materials and components are sourced from a limited number of suppliers or a single supplier we endeavor to qualify multiple suppliers using a robust qualification process in some cases we also enter into longterm supply contracts for raw materials and components accordingly we are exposed to price changes in the raw materials and components used in our solar modules and systems in addition the failure of a key supplier could disrupt our supply chain which could result in higher prices andor a disruption in our manufacturing or construction processes we may be unable to pass along changes in the costs of the raw materials and components for our modules and systems to our customers and may be in default of our delivery obligations if we experience a manufacturing or construction disruption 

credit risk 

we have certain financial and derivative instruments that subject us to credit risk these consist primarily of cash cash equivalents marketable securities accounts receivable restricted cash and investments notes receivable and foreign exchange forward contracts we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial and derivative instruments we place cash cash equivalents marketable securities restricted cash and investments and foreign exchange forward contracts with various highquality financial institutions and limit the amount of credit risk from any one counterparty we continuously evaluate the credit standing of our counterparty financial institutions our net sales are primarily concentrated among a limited number of customers we monitor the financial condition of our customers and perform credit evaluations whenever considered necessary depending upon the sales arrangement we may require some form of payment security from our customers including advance payments parent guarantees bank guarantees surety bonds or commercial letters of credit we also have ppas that subject us to credit risk in the event our offtake counterparties are unable to fulfill their contractual obligations which may adversely affect our project assets and certain receivables accordingly we closely monitor the credit standing of existing and potential offtake counterparties to limit such risks

 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in exchange act rule 13a15e and 15d15e based on that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of december 31 2018  our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate “internal control over financial reporting” as defined in exchange act rule 13a15f and 15d15f we also carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the 

 73 

effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2018  based on the criteria established in internal control – integrated framework 2013  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us gaap based on such evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2018  the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2018  has also been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in its report which appears herein 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

we also carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of our “internal control over financial reporting” to determine whether any changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2018  that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting based on that evaluation there were no such changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2018  

limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

control systems no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control systems’ objectives are being met further the design of any system of controls must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of all controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within our company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of error or mistake control systems can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

 item 1  business 

company overview 

we are a leading global provider of comprehensive pv solar energy solutions we design manufacture and sell pv solar modules with an advanced thin film semiconductor technology and also develop design construct and sell pv solar power systems that primarily use the modules we manufacture additionally we provide operations and maintenance “om” services to system owners we have substantial ongoing rd efforts focused on module and systemlevel innovations we are the world’s largest thin film pv solar module manufacturer and one of the world’s largest pv solar module manufacturers our mission is to provide costadvantaged solar technology through innovation customer engagement industry leadership and operational excellence 

in addressing overall global demand for electricity our highefficiency cdte modules and fully integrated systems business provide competitively priced utilityscale pv solar energy solutions which compete on an economic basis in many climates with traditional forms of energy generation and provide low cost electricity to endusers our verticallyintegrated capabilities enable us to provide such solutions accelerate the adoption of our technology and successfully sell into key markets around the world we seek to offer leadership across the entire solar value chain resulting in more reliable and cost effective pv solar energy solutions for our customers 

business strategy 

we believe the following strategies and points of differentiation provide the foundation for our leading industry position and enable us to remain one of the preferred providers of pv solar energy solutions 

differentiated technology 

as a fieldproven technology our cdte solar modules offer certain advantages over traditional crystalline silicon based solar modules by delivering competitive efficiency higher realworld energy yield and longterm reliability proven to deliver up to 8  more usable energy per nameplate watt than competing technologies in certain geographic markets and with a record of reliable system performance our cdte technology delivers more energy more consistently over the lifetime of a pv solar power system our recently introduced series 6 module technology with its combination of high conversion efficiencies low manufacturing costs larger form factor and balance of systems “bos” component compatibility is expected to further enhance our competitive position once production of such module technology begins in 2018 we expect our transition to series 6 module technology to enable us to maximize the intrinsic cost advantage of cdte thin film technology versus crystalline silicon 

in terms of energy yield in many climates our cdte solar modules provide a significant energy production advantage over most crystalline silicon solar modules of equivalent efficiency rating for example our cdte solar modules provide a superior temperature coefficient which results in stronger system performance in typical high insolation climates as the majority of a system’s generation on average occurs when module temperatures are well above 25°c standard test conditions in addition our cdte solar modules provide a superior spectral response in humid environments where atmospheric moisture alters the solar spectrum relative to laboratory standards our cdte solar modules also provide a better shading response than conventional crystalline silicon solar modules which may lose up to three times as much power as cdte solar modules when shading occurs as a result of these factors our pv solar power systems typically produce more annual energy in real world field conditions than competing systems with the same nameplate capacity 

manufacturing process 

our modules are manufactured in a highthroughput automated environment that integrates all manufacturing steps into a continuous flow line such manufacturing process eliminates the multiple supply chain operators and expensive 

 3 

and timeconsuming batch processing steps that are used to produce crystalline silicon solar modules at the outset a sheet of glass enters the production line and in less than 35  hours is transformed into a completed module which is flash tested boxed and ready for shipment with over 17  gw of modules sold worldwide we have a demonstrated history of manufacturing success and innovation we currently have multiple production lines at our manufacturing facilities in perrysburg ohio and kulim malaysia and plan to also utilize our manufacturing facility in ho chi minh city vietnam for the production of series 6 modules as we transition our remaining manufacturing capacity to series 6 module technology we expect to ramp down production of our series 4 tm  “series 4” modules over the next several years this transition process which has resulted in a temporary reduction in production capacity allows us to use our existing manufacturing infrastructure to more quickly and cost effectively deploy our series 6 module technology to best position us for longterm competitiveness and growth 

vertical integration 

we are vertically integrated across substantially the entire solar value chain many of the efficiencies cost reductions and capabilities that we deliver to our customers are not easily replicable for other industry participants that are not vertically integrated in a similar manner accordingly our operational model offers pv solar energy solutions that benefit from our wide range of capabilities including advanced pv solar module manufacturing project development engineering and plant optimization grid integration and plant control systems procurement and construction consulting and om services 

financial viability 

our commitment is to create longterm shareholder value through a balance of growth profitability and liquidity despite substantial downward pressure on the price of solar modules due to pricing competition and significant capacity in the industry we have continued to deliver strong and balanced financial performance such performance has also enabled us to fund our series 6 transition and capacity expansion initiatives using cash flows generated by our operations accordingly our financial viability provides strategic optionality as we evaluate how to invest in our business and generate returns for our shareholders our bankability and financial viability also enable us to offer meaningful module and system warranties after installation which provide us with a competitive advantage relative to some of our peers in the solar industry in the context of project financing and offering pv solar energy solutions to longterm owners 

sustainability 

in addition to our financial commitments we are also committed to minimizing the environmental impacts and enhancing the social and economic benefits of our products across their life cycle from raw material sourcing through endoflife module recycling accordingly our modules and systems provide an ecologically leading solution to climate change energy security and water scarcity which also enables our customers to achieve their sustainability objectives on a lifecycle basis our thin film module technology has the smallest carbon footprint fastest energy payback time and lowest water use of any pv solar technology on the market 

as a result of our specialized manufacturing process our modules have approximately half the carbon footprint of conventional crystalline silicon modules and a fraction of the carbon footprint of conventional energy sources furthermore our technology displaces up to 98  of greenhouse gas emissions and other air pollutants when replacing traditional forms of energy generation our manufacturing process also facilitates the fastest energy payback time which is the amount of time a system must operate to recover the energy required to produce it of all pv solar technologies in less than six months under high irradiance conditions our pv solar power systems produce more energy than was required to create them which represents a 50fold energy return on investment over a 25year system lifetime and an abundant net energy gain to the electricity grid our modules also use up to 300  times less water per mw hour than conventional energy and up to 12  times less water than other solar technologies in addition our industryleading recycling process further enhances our sustainability advantage by recovering approximately 90  of the glass for reuse in new glass products and over 90  of the semiconductor material for reuse in new first solar modules

market overview 

solar energy is one of the fastest growing forms of renewable energy with numerous economic and environmental benefits that make it an attractive complement to andor substitute for traditional forms of energy generation in recent years the price of pv solar power systems and accordingly the cost of producing electricity from such systems has dropped to levels that are competitive with or even below the wholesale price of electricity in many markets the rapid price decline that pv solar energy has experienced in recent years has opened new possibilities to develop systems in some locations with limited or no financial incentives the fact that a pv solar power system requires no fuel provides a unique and valuable hedging benefit to owners of such systems relative to traditional energy generation assets once installed pv solar power systems can function for 25 or more years with relatively less maintenance or oversight compared to traditional forms of energy generation in addition to these economic benefits solar energy has substantial environmental benefits for example pv solar power systems generate no greenhouse gas and other emissions and use no or minimal amounts of water compared to traditional forms of electricity generation worldwide solar markets continue to develop aided by the above factors as well as demand elasticity resulting from declining industry average selling prices both at the module and system level which make solar power more affordable 

the solar industry continues to be characterized by intense pricing competition both at the module and system levels in particular module average selling prices in the united states and several other key markets have experienced an accelerated decline in recent years and module average selling prices are expected to continue to decline globally to some degree in the future in the aggregate we believe manufacturers of solar cells and modules have significant installed production capacity relative to global demand and the ability for additional capacity expansion we believe the solar industry may from time to time experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity exceeds global demand and that such periods will put pressure on pricing additionally intense competition at the system level may result in an environment in which pricing falls rapidly thereby further increasing demand for solar energy solutions but constraining the ability for project developers epc companies and verticallyintegrated solar companies such as first solar to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability in light of such market realities we are focusing on our strategies and points of differentiation which include our advanced module and system technologies our manufacturing process our verticallyintegrated business model our financial viability and the sustainability of our modules and systems 

global markets 

we have established and are continuing to develop a global business presence energy markets are by their nature localized with different drivers and market forces impacting electricity generation and demand in a particular region or for a particular application accordingly our business is evolving worldwide and is shaped by the varying ways in which our pv solar energy solutions can be a compelling and economically viable solution to energy needs in different markets and applications the following markets represent the key markets for our pv solar modules and systems 

the americas 

multiple markets within the united states which accounted for 77  of our 2017  net sales exemplify favorable characteristics for a solar market including i sizeable electricity demand particularly around growing population centers and industrial areas ii strong demand for renewable energy generation and iii abundant solar resources in those areas and applications in which these factors are more pronounced our pv solar energy solutions compete favorably on an economic basis with traditional forms of energy generation the market penetration of pv solar is also impacted by certain state and federal support programs including the current 30  federal investment tax credit as described under “support programs” we have significant experience and a market leadership position in developing engineering constructing and maintaining utilityscale power plants in the united states particularly in california and other southwestern states and increasingly in southeastern states currently our solar projects in the united states account for a majority of the advancedstage pipeline of projects that we are either currently constructing or expect to construct see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – systems project pipeline” for more information about these projects

asiapacific 

australia  australia continues to be a promising region for pv solar energy with strong growth in 2017  that is expected to continue in 2018  this growth is being driven by an increased demand for ppas from australian utilities and large industrial offtakers in recent years we redirected our strategy in australia away from epc services to focus more on utilityscale project development and module sales moving into 2018  we expect to pursue a robust australian development pipeline including selfdeveloped projects in queensland new south wales and victoria in addition to this growing development pipeline we plan to deliver modules to various thirdparty developers in 2018  

japan japan’s electricity markets have various characteristics which make them attractive markets for pv solar energy in particular japan has few domestic fossil fuel resources and relies heavily on fossil fuel imports the country has also introduced certain initiatives to limit its reliance on nuclear power as a result of previous issues with such technology accordingly the japanese government has announced a longterm goal of dramatically increasing installed solar power capacity and has provided various incentives for solar power installations these programs are expected to maintain strong solar demand over the next several years we are partnering with local companies to develop construct and operate pv solar power systems which will further mitigate japan’s dependence on fossil fuel imports and nuclear power our sales offerings in japan also include our solar modules and om services in december 2017 we executed sales agreements for multiple projects in japan totaling 15  mw ac  which are the first projects we developed constructed and sold in the country we are also in the process of constructing a 59  mw ac  project in ishikawa prefecture a 40  mw ac  project in miyagi prefecture and a 19  mw ac  project in tochigi prefecture we have secured rights to sell power for these projects under separate 20 year ppas with local power companies 

india  there is significant potential for pv solar energy in india due to its growing energy needs substantial population centers lack of electrification to many parts of the country high energy costs strong irradiance and aggressive renewable energy targets set by the government which include increasing the country’s solar capacity to 100  gw by the year 2022  to support this initiative several key regulations have been announced relating to ramping up renewable purchase obligations implementing penal provisions for noncompliance with the obligations under the indian electricity act budgetary allocations for establishing a green transmission corridor and the creation of numerous solar parks in various states with dedicated transmission infrastructure to be installed by the government in addition to these measures the indian government also introduced the renewable generation obligations which mandate that all thermal power generators must implement new renewable energy generation capacity to match 10  of their new thermal generation capacity overall these policy and regulatory measures have been introduced to create significant and sustained demand for pv solar in india accordingly we continue to sell modules and develop utilityscale pv solar projects in india to address the energy and renewable purchase obligation needs of utilities and target the open access industrial and commercial power demand 

in december 2017  we completed the sale of our 25  mw ac  polepally and 10  mw ac  mahabubnagar projects which are the first projects we developed constructed and sold in india during 2017 we also executed definitive sales agreements for our winsol and hindupur projects which total 155  mw ac  and commissioned two additional projects totaling 40  mw ac  in karnataka for which we have secured rights to sell power under separate 25 year ppas to the state owned electricity distribution companies we continue to maintain our strong module presence in india with over 18  gw dc  of installed modules 

europe the middle east and africa 

europe  historically pv solar energy adoption in europe was driven to a large degree by feedintariffs “fits” and other incentive programs in germany france the netherlands italy and spain however pv solar energy in the region is transitioning to its next phase in which growth will be driven by the degree to which pv solar energy solutions can compete economically with more traditional forms of energy generation especially in areas with high prevailing electricity prices strong electricity demand and strong solar resources in particular germany france the netherlands and spain are all running tenders in which utilityscale pv solar projects can bid for capacity such tenders and other recent market developments indicate the potential for significant growth in the demand for pv solar energy we continue 

 7 

to pursue module sales activities in france the netherlands germany and turkey and are actively evaluating additional sales opportunities in other markets where we are collaborating with certain local partners for the distribution of our modules or select project development opportunities 

the middle east  the market potential for solar energy in the middle east continues to be driven by a combination of strong economic fundamentals aggressive tariff pricing abundant solar resources and robust policy the united arab emirates the “uae” saudi arabia egypt and jordan have established utilityscale solar programs which are at varying degrees of maturity the uae and jordan lead the region with policy mechanisms designed to ramp up the amount of renewable energy in their generation portfolios oman qatar and kuwait are also promising markets with indicators of future potential for solar energy while there are several motives for investing in solar energy including energy security diversification of generation portfolios and the minimization of domestic consumption of hydrocarbons the common factor is that the economics of pv solar energy have made it a compelling energy generation source since establishing a presence in the middle east in 2013 we have approximately 300 mw dc  of installed modules across the region 

africa  africa offers strong potential for pv solar energy which can play a useful role in meeting the region’s diversified energy needs as the overall african market matures the engagement of experienced project developers and support from international lenders are expected to further the adoption and growth of utilityscale pv solar energy solutions our primary focus in africa is the sale of modules for utilityscale projects additionally we are working with our channel partners to provide various solutions to the distributed generation and commercial and industrial markets 

support programs 

although we compete in key markets that do not require solarspecific government subsidies or support programs our net sales and profits remain subject in the near term to regulation and variability based on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives such as quotas renewable portfolio standards and tendering systems in addition to these support programs financial incentives for pv solar energy generation include tax incentives grants loans rebates and production incentives although we expect to become less impacted by and less dependent on these forms of government support over time such programs will continue to play varying roles in accelerating the adoption of pv solar power systems around the world 

in europe renewable energy targets in conjunction with tenders for utilityscale pv solar and other support measures have contributed to the growth in pv solar markets renewable energy targets prescribe how much energy consumption must come from renewable sources while incentive policies and competitive tender policies are intended to support new supply development by providing certainty to investors various european union “eu” directives on renewable energy have set targets for all eu member states in support of the goal of a 35  share of energy from renewable sources in the eu by 2030  

tax incentive programs exist in the united states at both the federal and state level and can take the form of investment and production tax credits accelerated depreciation and sales and property tax exemptions and abatements at the federal level investment tax credits for business and residential solar systems have gone through several cycles of enactment and expiration since the 1980s in 2015 the us congress extended the 30  federal energy investment tax credit “itc” for both residential and commercial solar installations through 2019 the credit will step down to 26  in 2020 22  in 2021 and remain at 10  permanently beginning in 2022  the itc has been an important economic driver of solar installations in the united states and its extension is expected to contribute to greater mediumterm demand visibility in the united states the positive impact of the itc depends to a large degree on the availability of tax equity for project financing and any significant reduction in the availability of tax equity in the future could make it more difficult to develop and construct projects requiring financing the eventual stepdown of the itc to 10  underscores the need for the levelized cost of electricity “lcoe” meaning the net present value of a system’s total life cycle costs divided by the quantity of energy that is expected to be produced over the system’s life of solar systems to continue to decline and remain competitive with other sources of energy generation 

 8 

in october 2017 the us environmental protection agency administrator issued a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing to repeal the previous us presidential administration’s clean power plan the “rule” which establishes standards to limit carbon dioxide emissions from existing power generation facilities accordingly there is significant uncertainty regarding what effects if any the rule may have on pv solar markets the implementation and adoption of the rule remains subject to ongoing litigation initiated by states and other stakeholders 

the majority of states in the united states have enacted legislation adopting renewable portfolio standard “rps” mechanisms under a rps regulated utilities and other load serving entities are required to procure a specified percentage of their total retail electricity sales to enduser customers from eligible renewable resources such as solar energy generation facilities by a specified date some programs may further require that a specified portion of the total percentage of renewable energy must come from solar generation facilities or other technologies rps legislation and implementing regulations vary significantly from state to state particularly with respect to the percentage of renewable energy required to achieve the state’s rps the definition of eligible renewable energy resources and the extent to which renewable energy credits certificates representing the generation of renewable energy qualify for rps compliance measured in terms of the volume of renewable electricity required to meet its rps mandate california’s rps program is the most significant in the united states and the california market for renewable energy has dominated the western us region for the past several years first enacted in 2002  california’s rps statute has been amended several times to increase the overall percentage requirement as well as to accelerate the target date for program compliance pursuant to amendments enacted by the california legislature in 2015  the california rps program now requires utilities and other obligated load serving entities to procure 50  of their total retail electricity demand from eligible renewable resources by 2030  in 2017  approximately 29  of our total net sales were derived from our systems projects or thirdparty module sales to solar power projects in california 

various proposed and contemplated environmental and tax policies may create regulatory uncertainty in the renewable energy sector including the solar energy sector and may lead to a reduction or removal of various clean energy programs and initiatives designed to curtail climate change for more information about the risks associated with these potential government actions see item 1a “risk factors – the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives tax incentives renewable energy targets and other support for ongrid solar electricity applications or other adverse public policies such as tariffs or other trade remedies imposed on solar cells and modules could negatively impact demand andor price levels for our solar modules and systems and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales thereby adversely impacting our operating results ”

modules business 

solar modules 

since the inception of first solar our flagship module has been manufactured using our advanced cdte thin film technology each series 4 module is a glass laminate approximately 2ft x 4ft 60cm x 120cm in size that encapsulates thin film semiconductor materials our modules had an average rated power per module of approximately 118 watts  114 watts  and 107 watts  for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively our series 4 module which offers up to 8  more energy than conventional crystalline silicon modules of equivalent efficiency rating is compatible with advanced 1500volt plant architectures our series 4a tm  module variant features antireflective coated glass which further enhances energy production our module semiconductor structure is a singlejunction polycrystalline thin film that uses cdte as the absorption layer cdte has absorption properties that are well matched to the solar spectrum and can deliver competitive conversion efficiencies using approximately 12 of the amount of semiconductor material that is used to manufacture conventional crystalline silicon solar modules 

in november 2016 we announced plans for the introduction of our series 6 module which will be manufactured using similar materials and processes as our legacy module technologies that have been proven in high volume production and have been in the field for over a decade each series 6 module is approximately 4ft x 6ft 123cm x 201cm in size and is expected to have an average rated power per module of over 420 watts  we expect to begin production of our series 6 modules in 2018 

manufacturing process 

we manufacture our cdte solar modules on highthroughput integrated production lines in an automated proprietary and continuous process our solar modules employ a thin layer of semiconductor material to convert sunlight into electricity our manufacturing process eliminates the multiple supply chain operators and expensive and timeconsuming batch processing steps that are used to produce crystalline silicon solar modules we currently manufacture solar modules at our perrysburg ohio and kulim malaysia manufacturing facilities and plan to utilize our manufacturing facility in ho chi minh city vietnam for the production of series 6 modules as we transition our manufacturing capacity to series 6 module technology we expect to ramp down production of our series 4 modules over the next several years 

our cdte manufacturing processes includes the following three stages i the deposition stage ii the cell definition and treatment stage and iii the assembly and test stage in the deposition stage panels of transparent oxidecoated glass are robotically loaded onto the production line where they are cleaned lasermark identified with a serial number heated and coated with thin layers of cdte and other semiconductor materials using our proprietary vapor transport deposition technology after which the semiconductorcoated plates are cooled rapidly to increase glass strength in the cell definition and treatment stage we use highspeed lasers to transform the large continuous semiconductor coating on the glass plate into a series of interconnected cells that deliver the desired current and voltage output in this stage we also treat the semiconductor film using proprietary chemistries and processes to improve the device’s performance and we apply a metal sputtered back contact finally in the assembly and test stage we apply busbars interlayer material and a rear glass cover sheet that is laminated to encapsulate the device a junction box termination wires and an undermount frame for series 6 modules are then applied to complete the assembly the final assembly stage is the only stage in our production line that requires manual processing 

we maintain a robust quality and reliability assurance program that monitors critical process parameters and measures product performance to ensure that industry and more stringent internal standards are met acceptance testing for electrical leakage visual quality and power measurement on a solar simulator are also conducted prior to a module being boxed for shipment the quality and reliability tests complement production surveillance with an ongoing monitoring program subjecting production modules to accelerated life stress testing to help ensure ongoing conformance to requirements of the international electrotechnical commission and underwriters laboratories inc these programs help assure delivery of power and performance in the field with a high level of product quality and reliability

research development and engineering 

our rd model differentiates us from much of our competition due to its vertical integration from advanced research to product development manufacturing and applications we continue to devote substantial resources to our rd efforts which generally focus on continually improving the conversion efficiency and energy yield of our solar modules we also focus our rd activities on continuously improving module durability and manufacturing efficiencies including throughput improvement volume ramp and material cost reduction based on publicly available information we lead all pv solar module manufacturers in rd investment maintaining a rate of innovation that enables rapid efficiency gains and cost reductions 

in the course of our rd activities we explore various technologies in our efforts to sustain competitive differentiation in our modules we primarily conduct our rd activities and qualify process and product improvements for full production at our perrysburg ohio plant and then use a systematic process to propagate them to our other production lines we believe that our systematic approach to technology change management provides continuous improvements and ensures uniform adoption across our production lines in addition our cdte production lines are replicas or near replicas of each other and as a result a process or production improvement on one line can be rapidly and reliably deployed to other production lines 

we regularly produce research cells in our laboratories some of which are tested for performance and certified by independent labs such as the national renewable energy laboratory cell efficiency measures the proportion of light converted to electricity in a single solar cell at standard test conditions our research cells are produced using laboratory equipment and methods and are not intended to be representative of our manufacturing capability our module conversion efficiency has improved on average more than half a percent every year for the last ten years we currently hold two world records for cdte pv efficiency achieving an independently certified research cell efficiency of 221  and a full area module efficiency of 182  we believe that our record cells demonstrate a potential longterm module efficiency entitlement of over 20  using our commercialscale manufacturing equipment for information regarding our research and development expense for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – results of operations” 

customers 

during 2017  we sold the majority of our solar modules not included in our systems projects to integrators and operators of systems in the united states  india  and turkey  and such thirdparty module sales represented approximately 27  of our total net sales during 2017  zorlu enerji  and rcr o’donnell griffin pty ltd  each accounted for more than 10  of our modules business net sales 

we continue to invest in key geographic markets particularly in areas with abundant solar resources and sizable electricity demand and additional customer relationships to diversify our customer base we also collaborate with strategic partners in community solar solutions which address the residential and small business sectors to provide a broad range of customers with access to competitively priced solar energy regardless of the suitability of their rooftops community solar utilizes relatively small groundmounted installations that provide clean energy to utilities which then offer consumers the ability to buy into a specific community installation and benefit from the solar power generated by that resource the demand for such offerings continues to build as states across the country are beginning to enact community solar policies and utilities are looking to diversify their energy generation portfolio in order to meet customer demand for affordable clean energy we also collaborate with providers of community choice aggregation programs which allow cities and counties to purchase power on behalf of residents and businesses to provide clean energy options at competitive prices our expertise in utilityscale generation and module technology paired with community solar andor community choice aggregation allows residential power consumers to “go solar” including those who live in apartment buildings or whose home rooftops cannot accommodate solar panels 

 11 

competition 

the solar energy and renewable energy sectors are highly competitive and continually evolving as participants in these sectors strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete within the larger electric power industry we face intense competition for sales of solar modules which has resulted in and may continue to result in reduced average selling prices and loss of market share with respect to our modules business our primary sources of competition are crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers as well as other thin film solar module manufacturers in addition we expect to compete with future entrants into the pv solar industry that offer new technological solutions we also face competition from semiconductor manufacturers and semiconductor equipment manufacturers or their customers that produce pv solar cells solar modules or turnkey production lines we also compete with companies that currently offer or are developing other renewable energy technologies including wind hydroelectric geothermal biomass and tidal technologies as well as traditional energy generation sources 

certain of our existing or future competitors may have direct or indirect access to sovereign capital which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time among pv solar module manufacturers the principal methods of competition include sales price per watt conversion efficiency energy yield reliability warranty terms and customer payment terms if competitors reduce module pricing to levels near or below their manufacturing costs or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time our results of operations could be adversely affected we believe the solar industry may from time to time experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity exceeds global demand and that such periods will put pressure on pricing which could adversely affect our results of operations for additional information see item 1a “risk factors – competition in solar markets globally and across the solar value chain is intense and could remain that way for an extended period of time an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may continue to cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations ” 

raw materials 

our cdte module manufacturing process uses approximately 30 types of raw materials and components to construct a solar module one critical raw material in our production process is cdte of the other raw materials and components the following are also critical to our manufacturing process front glass coated with transparent conductive oxide other semiconductor materials organics such as photo resist tempered back glass frames packaging components such as interlayer cord platecord plate cap lead wire and solar connectors before we use these materials and components in our manufacturing process a supplier must undergo a rigorous qualification process we continually evaluate new suppliers and currently are qualifying new suppliers and materials when possible we attempt to use suppliers that can provide a raw material supply source that is near our manufacturing locations reducing the cost and lead times for such materials several of our key raw materials and components are either singlesourced or sourced from a limited number of suppliers 

solar module collection and recycling program 

we are committed to extended producer responsibility and take into account the environmental impact of our products over their entire life cycle as part of such efforts we established the solar industry’s first comprehensive module collection and recycling program our module recycling process is designed to enable the recovery of valuable materials including the glass and encapsulated semiconductor material for use in new modules or other products and minimizes the environmental impacts associated with our modules at the end of their useful lives approximately 90  of each collected first solar module can be recycled into materials for reuse for customer sales contracts that include modules covered under this program we agree to pay the costs for the collection and recycling of qualifying solar modules and the endusers agree to notify us disassemble their solar power systems package the solar modules for shipment and revert ownership rights over the modules back to us at the end of the modules’ service lives we currently have recycling facilities operating at each of our manufacturing facilities in the united states and malaysia and at our former manufacturing facility location in germany 

 12 

the eu’s waste electronics and electrical equipment “weee” directive places the obligation of recycling including collection treatment and environmentally sound disposal of electrical and electronic equipment products upon producers and such directive is applicable to pv solar modules in eu member states for modules covered under our program that were previously sold into and installed in the eu we continue to maintain a commitment to cover the estimated collection and recycling costs consistent with our historical program additionally as a result of the transposition of the weee directive by the eu member states we have adjusted our offerings as required in various eu member states to ensure compliance with specific eu member state weee regulations 

solar module warranties 

we provide a limited pv solar module warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for approximately 10  years we also typically warrant that modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 98  of their labeled power output rating during the first year with the warranty coverage reducing by 05  every year thereafter throughout the approximate 25 year performance warranty period as an alternative form of our standard limited module power output warranty we also offer an aggregated or systemlevel limited module performance warranty this systemlevel limited module performance warranty is designed for utilityscale systems and provides 25 year systemlevel energy degradation protection for additional information on our solar module warranty programs refer to item 1a “risk factors – problems with product quality or performance including our series 4 modules and series 6 modules may cause us to incur significant andor unexpected warranty and related expenses damage our market reputation and prevent us from maintaining or increasing our market share ” 

systems business 

project development 

project development activities generally include i site selection and securing rights to acquire or use the site ii obtaining the requisite interconnection and transmission studies iii executing an interconnection agreement iv obtaining environmental and landuse permits v maintaining effective site control and vi entering into a ppa with an offtaker of the power to be generated by the project the sequence of such development activities varies by international location and in certain locations may begin by initially bidding for ppa or offtake agreements these activities culminate in receiving the right to construct and operate a pv solar power system depending on the market opportunity or geographic location we may acquire projects in various stages of development or acquire project companies from developers in order to complete the development process construct a system incorporating our modules and sell the system to a longterm owner we may also collaborate with local partners in connection with these project development activities depending on the type of project or geographic location ppas or fit structures define the price and terms the utility or customer will pay for power produced from the project depending primarily on the location stage of development upon our acquisition of the project andor other site attributes the development cycle typically ranges from one to two years but can be as long as five years we may be required to incur significant costs for preliminary engineering permitting legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built if there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals we may be forced to incur additional costs or impair our project assets and the termination rights of the offtaker under the ppa may be triggered

epc services include engineering design and related services bos procurement advanced development of grid integration solutions and construction contracting and management we provide the majority of our epc services to our selfdeveloped projects intended to be sold however we may also provide epc services to other system owners such as utilities independent power producers and commercial and industrial companies depending on the customer and market need we may provide our full epc services or any combination of individual products and services within our epc capabilities 

 13 

we conduct performance testing of a system prior to substantial completion to confirm the system meets its operational and capacity expectations noted in the epc agreement for pv solar power systems we construct we typically provide limited warranties for defects in engineering design installation and bos part workmanship for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a system or a block within the system we may also provide an energy performance test during the first or second year of a system’s operation to demonstrate that the actual energy generation for the applicable year meets or exceeds the modeled energy expectation after certain adjustments such as irradiance weather module degradation soiling curtailment and other conditions that may affect a system’s energy output but are unrelated to quality design or construction 

om services 

our typical om service arrangements involve the performance of standard activities associated with operating and maintaining a pv solar power system we perform such activities pursuant to the scope of services outlined in the underlying contract these activities are considered necessary to optimize system performance and comply with ppas other agreements and regulations although the scope of our services may vary by contract our om service arrangements generally include 247 system monitoring certain ppa and other agreement compliance nerc compliance large generator interconnection agreement compliance energy forecasting performance engineering analysis regular performance reporting turnkey maintenance services including spare parts and corrective maintenance repair warranty management and environmental services as part of our om services we also typically provide an effective availability guarantee which stipulates that a system will be available to generate a certain percentage of total possible energy during a specific period after adjusting for factors outside of our control as the service provider such as weather curtailment outages force majeure and other conditions that may affect system availability 

customers 

our systems customers consist of utilities independent power producers commercial and industrial companies and other system owners such as investors who are looking for longterm investment vehicles that are expected to generate consistent returns such customers may purchase completed systems which include our solar modules or any combination of development epc services andor om services during 2017  the substantial majority of our systems business sales were in north america and the principal customer of our systems business was capital dynamics inc  “capital dynamics” who accounted for more than 10  of our systems business net sales 

in certain markets the emergence of utilityowned generation has increased the number of potential project buyers as such utility customers benefit from a potentially low cost of capital available through ratebasing utility investments given their longterm ownership profile utilityowned generation customers typically seek to partner with verticallyintegrated companies such as first solar who can provide a broad spectrum of utilityscale generation solutions including reliable pv solar technology project development and construction and om services thereby mitigating their longterm ownership risks the wholesale commercial and industrial market also represents a promising opportunity given our utilityscale pv solar power system expertise the demand for corporate renewables is accelerating with corporations worldwide committing to the re100 campaign a collaborative global initiative of influential businesses committed to 100 renewable electricity we believe we also have a competitive advantage in the commercial and industrial market due to customers’ sensitivity to the bankability and financial viability of their suppliers and geographically diverse operating locations with our strong development experience financial strength and global footprint we are well positioned to meet their needs for example we recently completed the sale of our california flats project in monterey county california from which apple inc will purchase electricity from 130 mw ac  of the project under a 25year ppa 

competition 

with respect to our systems business we face competition from other providers of renewable energy solutions including developers of pv solar power systems and developers of other forms of renewable energy projects such as wind hydroelectric geothermal biomass and tidal projects to the extent other solar module manufacturers become more 

 14 

vertically integrated we expect to face increased competition from such companies as well we also face competition from other epc companies and joint venture type arrangements between epc companies and solar companies certain current or potential future competitors may have a low cost of capital andor access to foreign capital the decline in module prices over the last several years has increased interest in solar energy worldwide and there are limited barriers to entry in certain parts of the pv solar value chain depending on the geographic market accordingly competition at the system level can be intense thereby exerting downward pressure on systemlevel average selling prices industrywide see item 1a “risk factors – competition at the system level can be intense thereby potentially exerting downward pressure on systemlevel profit margins industrywide which could reduce our profitability and adversely affect our results of operations ” 

research development and engineering 

our systems related rd activities are primarily focused on the objective of lowering the lcoe of a pv solar power system through reductions in bos costs improved system design and energy yield enhancements associated with systems that use our modules such rd efforts are also focused on continuing to improve our systems in terms of grid integration and reliability we conduct our rd activities for systems primarily in the united states innovations related to system design inverters and power converters hardware platforms and installation techniques and knowhow among other things can and are expected in the future to continue to reduce bos costs which can represent a significant portion of the costs associated with the construction of a typical utilityscale pv solar power system for information regarding our research and development expense for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – results of operations” 

own and operate 

from time to time we may temporarily own and operate or retain interests in certain of our systems for a period of time based on strategic opportunities or market factors the ability to do so provides certain potential benefits including greater control over the sales process and offering a lower risk profile to project buyers as of december 31 2017  we owned and operated a number of systems in various geographic markets including chile india the united states and the asiapacific region as an owner and operator of certain us systems we may be subject to the authority of the federal energy regulatory commission “ferc” as well as various other local state and federal regulatory bodies for more information about risks related to owning and operating such systems please see item 1a “risk factors – as an owner and operator of pv solar power systems that deliver electricity to the grid certain of our affiliated entities may be regulated as public utilities under us federal and state law which could adversely affect the cost of doing business and limit our growth ” for more information about the economics of such ownership and the impacts on our liquidity see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources” 

intellectual property 

our success depends in part on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technology and to conduct our business without infringing on the proprietary rights of others we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks and trade secrets as well as associate and thirdparty confidentiality agreements to safeguard our intellectual property we regularly file patent applications to protect inventions arising from our rd activities and are currently pursuing patent applications in the united states and other countries our patent applications and any future patent applications might not result in a patent being issued with the scope of the claims we seek or at all and any patents we may receive may be challenged invalidated or declared unenforceable in addition we have registered andor have applied to register trademarks and service marks in the united states and a number of foreign countries for “first solar” 

with respect to proprietary knowhow that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce we rely on among other things trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests we believe that many elements of our pv solar module manufacturing processes including our unique materials sourcing 

 15 

involve proprietary knowhow technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications including technical processes equipment designs algorithms and procedures we have taken security measures to protect these elements our rd personnel have entered into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us these agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our associates to assign to us all of the inventions designs and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us we also require our customers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose sensitive aspects of our modules technology or business plans 

we have not been subject to any material intellectual property infringement or misappropriation claims 

environmental health and safety matters 

our operations include the use handling storage transportation generation and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes we are subject to various national state local and international laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the use management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes occupational health and safety and the cleanup of contaminated sites therefore we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions and costs arising from thirdparty property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations or noncompliance with environmental permits required for our operations we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety requirements and do not expect to incur material expenditures for environmental and occupational health and safety controls in the foreseeable future however future developments such as the implementation of new more stringent laws and regulations more aggressive enforcement policies or the discovery of unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see item 1a “risk factors – environmental obligations and liabilities could have a substantial negative impact on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations ”

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the following information together with the other information in this annual report on form 10k before buying shares of our stock if any of the following risks or uncertainties occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our stock could decline 

risks related to our markets and customers 

competition in solar markets globally and across the solar value chain is intense and could remain that way for an extended period of time an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may continue to cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  

in the aggregate we believe manufacturers of solar cells and modules have significant installed production capacity relative to global demand and the ability for additional capacity expansion for example we estimate that in 2017 over 20 gw of capacity was added by solar module manufacturers particularly but not exclusively in asia we believe the solar industry may from time to time experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity exceeds global demand and that such periods will put pressure on pricing during the past several years industry average selling prices per watt have declined at times significantly both at the module and system levels as competitors have reduced prices to sell inventories worldwide there may be additional pressure on global demand and average selling prices in the future resulting from fluctuating demand in certain major solar markets such as china if our competitors reduce module pricing to levels near or below their manufacturing costs or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time or if demand for pv modules does not grow sufficiently to justify the current production supply our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

 19 

if pv solar and related technologies are not suitable for widespread adoption at economically attractive rates of return or if sufficient additional demand for solar modules related technologies and systems does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate our net sales and profit may flatten or decline and we may be unable to sustain profitability 

in comparison to traditional forms of energy generation the solar energy market continues to be at a relatively early stage of development if utilityscale pv solar technology proves unsuitable for widespread adoption at economically attractive rates of return or if additional demand for solar modules and systems fails to develop sufficiently or takes longer to develop than we anticipate we may be unable to grow our business or generate sufficient net sales to sustain profitability in addition demand for solar modules related technologies and systems in our targeted markets may develop to a lesser extent than we anticipate many factors may affect the viability of widespread adoption of utilityscale pv solar technology in our targeted markets as well as the demand for solar modules and systems generally including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives tax incentives renewable energy targets and other support for ongrid solar electricity applications or other adverse public policies such as tariffs or other trade remedies imposed on solar cells and modules could negatively impact demand andor price levels for our solar modules and systems and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales thereby adversely impacting our operating results  

although we believe that solar energy will experience widespread adoption in those applications where it competes economically with traditional forms of energy without any support programs in certain markets our net sales and profit remain subject to variability based on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives federal state and local governmental bodies in many countries have provided subsidies in the form of fits rebates 

 20 

tax incentives and other incentives to endusers distributors system integrators and manufacturers of pv solar products many of these support programs expire phase out over time require renewal by the applicable authority or may be amended a summary of certain recent developments in the major government support programs that may impact our business appears under item 1 “business – support programs” to the extent these support programs are reduced earlier than previously expected or are changed retroactively such changes could negatively impact demand andor price levels for our solar modules and systems lead to a reduction in our net sales and adversely impact our operating results another consideration in the us market and to a lesser extent in other global markets is the effect of governmental landuse planning policies and environmental policies on utilityscale pv solar development the adoption of restrictive landuse designations or environmental regulations that proscribe or restrict the siting of utilityscale solar facilities could adversely affect the marginal cost of such development 

in addition policies of the us presidential administration may create regulatory uncertainty in the renewable energy industry including the solar industry and our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected members of the us presidential administration including representatives of the us department of energy have made public statements that indicate that the administration may not be supportive of various clean energy programs and initiatives designed to curtail climate change for example in june 2017 the us president announced that the us would withdraw from participation in the 2015 paris agreement on climate change mitigation in addition the administration has indicated that it may be supportive of overturning or modifying policies of or regulations enacted by the prior administration that placed limitations on gas and coal electricity generation mining andor exploration additionally in october 2017 the us environmental protection agency administrator issued a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing to repeal the previous us presidential administration’s clean power plan which establishes standards to limit carbon dioxide emissions from existing power generation facilities if the current us administration andor the us congress takes action or continues to publicly speak out about the need to take action in furtherance of any such policies we would be subject to significant risks including the following 

 

 

 

 21 

application of us trade laws or trade laws of other countries may also impact either directly or indirectly our operating results for example in april 2017 a usbased manufacturer of solar cells filed a petition under sections 201 and 202 of the trade act of 1974 for global safeguard relief with the us international trade commission the “usitc” such petition requested among other things the imposition of certain tariffs on crystalline silicon solar cells imported into the united states and the establishment of a minimum price per watt on imported crystalline silicon solar modules in september 2017 the usitc determined such products are being imported into the united states in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury to the relevant domestic industry and subsequently recommended various remedies to the us president in january 2018 the president proclaimed tariffs on imported crystalline silicon modules and a tariffrate quota on imported crystalline silicon cells over a fouryear period with the tariff on modules and the tariff on cells above the first 25 gw dc  of imports starting at 30 for the february 2018 to february 2019 period and declining by five percentage points in each subsequent 12month period thin film solar cell products such as our cdte technology are expressly excluded from the tariffs some countries and companies have challenged the tariffs under the rules of the world trade organization and us law it is unknown if such tariffs will be applied as originally proclaimed or how such tariffs or any other us or global trade remedies or other trade barriers may directly or indirectly affect us or global markets for solar energy and our business financial condition and results of operations 

these examples show that established markets for pv solar development such as the us market face uncertainties arising from policy regulatory and governmental constraints while the expected potential of the emerging markets we are targeting is significant policy promulgation and market development are especially vulnerable to governmental inertia political instability the imposition of trade remedies and other trade barriers geopolitical risk fossil fuel subsidization potentially stringent localization requirements and limited available infrastructure 

we may be unable to fully execute on our longterm strategic plans which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we face numerous difficulties in executing on our longterm strategic plans particularly in new foreign jurisdictions including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 22 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition please see the risk factors entitled “ our substantial international operations subject us to a number of risks including unfavorable political regulatory labor and tax conditions in the united states andor foreign countries ” and “ the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives tax incentives renewable energy targets and other support for ongrid solar electricity applications or other adverse public policies such as tariffs or other trade remedies imposed on solar cells and modules could negatively impact demand andor price levels for our solar modules and systems and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales thereby adversely impacting our operating results ” 

we may be unable to profitably provide new solar offerings or achieve sufficient market penetration with such offerings 

we may expand our portfolio of offerings to include solutions that build upon our core competencies but for which we have not had significant historical experience including variations in our traditional product offerings or other offerings related to commercial and industrial customers and community solar we cannot be certain that we will be able to ascertain and allocate the appropriate financial and human resources necessary to grow these business areas we could invest capital into growing these businesses but fail to address market or customer needs or otherwise not experience a satisfactory level of financial return also in expanding into these areas we may be competing against companies that previously have not been significant competitors such as companies that currently have substantially more experience than we do in the residential commercial and industrial or other targeted offerings if we are unable to achieve growth in these areas our overall growth and financial performance may be limited relative to our competitors and our operating results could be adversely impacted 

an increase in interest rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets including a reduction in total tax equity availability could make it difficult for customers to finance the cost of a pv solar power system and could reduce the demand for our modules or systems andor lead to a reduction in the average selling price for such offerings  

many of our customers and our systems business depend on debt andor equity financing to fund the initial capital expenditure required to develop build andor purchase a pv solar power system as a result an increase in interest rates or a reduction in the supply of project debt financing or tax equity investments including reductions due to a 

 23 

change in tax related incentives that benefit tax equity investors such as the reduction of the us corporate income tax rate to 21 for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 under the tax act which could reduce the value of these incentives could reduce the number of solar projects that receive financing or otherwise make it difficult for our customers or our systems business to secure the financing necessary to develop build purchase or install a pv solar power system on favorable terms or at all and thus lower demand for our solar modules which could limit our growth or reduce our net sales see the risk factor entitled “ the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives tax incentives renewable energy targets and other support for ongrid solar electricity applications or other adverse public policies such as tariffs or other trade remedies imposed on solar cells and modules could negatively impact demand andor price levels for our solar modules and systems and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales thereby adversely impacting our operating results ” for additional information in addition we believe that a significant percentage of our customers install systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt an increase in interest rates and the reduction of the us corporate income tax rate as described above could lower an investor’s return on investment in a system increase equity return requirements or make alternative investments more attractive relative to pv solar power systems and in each case could cause these customers to seek alternative investments 

risks related to our operations manufacturing and technology 

our future success depends on our ability to effectively balance manufacturing production with market demand convert existing production facilities to support new product lines such as our transition to series 6 module manufacturing and when necessary continue to build new manufacturing plants over time in response to such demand and add production lines in a costeffective manner all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties  

our future success depends on our ability to effectively balance manufacturing production with market demand convert existing production facilities to support new product lines such as our transition to series 6 module manufacturing and increase both our manufacturing capacity and production throughput over time in a costeffective and efficient manner if we cannot do so we may be unable to expand our business decrease our manufacturing cost per watt maintain our competitive position satisfy our contractual obligations sustain profitability or create longterm shareholder value our ability to expand production capacity or to convert existing production facilities to support new product lines such as our transition to series 6 module manufacturing is subject to significant risks and uncertainties including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 24 

 

we face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules as well as other thin film solar modules if global supply exceeds global demand it could lead to a further reduction in the average selling price for pv solar modules  which could reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations 

the solar and renewable energy industries are highly competitive and are continually evolving as participants strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete with the larger electric power industry within the global pv solar industry we face intense competition from crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers and other thin film solar module manufacturers existing or future solar module manufacturers might be acquired by larger companies with significant capital resources thereby further intensifying competition with us in addition the introduction of a low cost disruptive technology could adversely affect our ability to compete which could reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations 

even if demand for solar modules continues to grow the rapid manufacturing capacity expansion undertaken by many module manufacturers particularly manufacturers of crystalline silicon cells and modules has created and may continue to cause periods of structural imbalance in which supply exceeds demand see the risk factor entitled “ competition in solar markets globally and across the solar value chain is intense and could remain that way for an extended period of time an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may continue to cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations ” for additional information in addition we believe any significant decrease in the cost of silicon feedstock or polysilicon would reduce the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon modules and lead to further pricing pressure for solar modules and potentially an oversupply of solar modules we also believe many crystalline silicon cell and wafer manufacturers are transitioning from lower efficiency back surface field “bsf” multicrystalline cells the legacy technology against which we have generally competed in our markets to higher efficiency passivated emitter rear contact “perc” multicrystalline and monocrystalline cells at competitive cost structures as a result we expect that in the future our primary competition might transition to multicrystalline and monocrystalline perc based modules with higher conversion efficiencies additionally while conventional solar modules including the solar modules we produce are monofacial meaning their ability to produce energy is a function of direct and diffuse irradiance on their front side certain manufacturers of monocrystalline perc solar modules are pursuing the commercialization of bifacial modules that also capture diffuse irradiance on the back side of a module such technology can improve the overall energy production of a module relative to nameplate efficiency when applied in certain applications and bos configurations which could potentially lower the overall lcoe of a system when compared to systems using conventional solar modules including the modules we produce 

during any such period our competitors could decide to reduce their sales prices in response to competition even below their manufacturing costs in order to generate sales and may do so for a sustained period other competitors may have direct or indirect access to sovereign capital which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time as a result we may be unable to sell our solar modules or systems at attractive prices or for a profit during any period of excess supply of solar modules which would reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations additionally we may decide to lower our average selling prices to certain customers in certain markets in response to competition which could also reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations 

problems with product quality or performance including our series 4 modules and series 6 modules may cause us to incur significant andor unexpected warranty and related expenses damage our market reputation and prevent us from maintaining or increasing our market share 

we perform a variety of module quality and life tests under different conditions upon which we base our assessments and warranty of module performance over the duration of the warranty however if our thin film solar modules 

 25 

including our series 4 modules and series 6 modules perform below expectations we could experience significant warranty and related expenses damage to our market reputation and erosion of our market share with respect to our modules we provide a limited warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for approximately 10 years we also typically warrant that modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 98  of their labeled power output rating during the first year with the warranty coverage reducing by 05  every year thereafter throughout the approximate 25year performance warranty period as an alternative form of our standard limited module power output warranty we also offer an aggregated or systemlevel limited module performance warranty this systemlevel limited module performance warranty is designed for utilityscale systems and provides 25year systemlevel energy degradation protection this warranty represents a practical expedient to address the challenge of identifying from the potential millions of modules installed in a utilityscale system individual modules that may be performing below warranty thresholds by focusing on the aggregate energy generated by the system rather than the power output of individual modules the systemlevel limited module performance warranty is typically calculated as a percentage of a system’s expected energy production adjusted for certain actual site conditions with the warranted level of performance declining each year in a linear fashion but never falling below 80  during the term of the warranty as a result of these programs we bear the risk of product warranty claims long after we have sold our solar modules and recognized net sales 

if any of the assumptions used in estimating our module warranties prove incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses which could adversely impact our financial position operating results and cash flows although we have taken significant precautions to avoid a manufacturing excursion from occurring any manufacturing excursions including any commitments made by us to take remediation actions in respect of affected modules beyond our warranties could adversely impact our reputation financial position operating results and cash flows 

although our module performance warranties extend for 25 years our oldest solar modules manufactured during the qualification of our pilot production line have only been in use since 2001 accordingly our warranties are based on a variety of quality and life tests that enable predictions of durability and future performance these predictions however could prove to be materially different from the actual performance during the warranty period causing us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective solar modules or provide financial remuneration in the future for example our solar modules including our series 4 modules and series 6 modules could suffer various failure modes including breakage delamination corrosion or performance degradation in excess of expectations and our manufacturing operations or supply chain could be subject to materials or process variations that could cause affected modules to fail or underperform compared to our expectations these risks could be amplified as we implement design and process changes in connection with our efforts to improve our products and accelerate module conversion efficiencies as part of our longterm strategic plans and as we transition to series 6 module manufacturing in addition as we increase the number of installations in extreme climates we may experience increased failure rates due to deployment into such field conditions any widespread product failures may damage our market reputation cause our net sales to decline require us to repair or replace the defective modules or provide financial remuneration and result in us taking voluntary remedial measures beyond those required by our standard warranty terms to enhance customer satisfaction which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

in resolving claims under both the limited defect and power output warranties we typically have the option of either repairing or replacing the covered modules or under the limited power output warranty providing additional modules to remedy the power shortfall or making certain cash payments however historical versions of our module warranty did not provide a refund remedy consequently we may be obligated to repair or replace the covered modules under such historical programs as our manufacturing process may change from timetotime in accordance with our technology roadmap we may elect to stop production of older versions of our modules that would constitute compatible replacement modules in some jurisdictions our inability to provide compatible replacement modules could potentially expose us to liabilities beyond the limitations of our module warranties which could adversely impact our reputation financial position operating results and cash flows 

for pv solar power systems we construct we typically provide limited warranties for defects in engineering design installation and bos part workmanship for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a 

 26 

system or a block within the system in resolving claims under such bos warranties we have the option of remedying the defect through repair or replacement as with our modules these warranties are based on a variety of quality and life tests that enable predictions of durability and future performance any failures in bos equipment or system construction beyond our expectations may also adversely impact our reputation financial position operating results and cash flows 

our failure to further refine our technology reduce module manufacturing and bos costs and develop and introduce improved pv products could render our solar modules or systems uncompetitive and reduce our net sales profitability andor market share 

we need to continue to invest significant financial resources in rd to continue to improve our module conversion efficiencies lower the lcoe of our pv solar power systems and otherwise keep pace with technological advances in the solar industry however rd activities are inherently uncertain and we could encounter practical difficulties in commercializing our research results we seek to continuously improve our products and processes including for example our transition to series 6 module manufacturing and the resulting changes carry potential risks in the form of delays performance additional costs or other unintended contingencies in addition our significant expenditures on rd may not produce corresponding benefits other companies are developing a variety of competing pv technologies including advanced multicrystalline silicon cells perc or advanced ptype crystalline silicon cells highefficiency ntype crystalline silicon cells copper indium gallium diselenide thin films amorphous silicon thin films and new emerging technologies such as hybrid perovskites which could produce solar modules or systems that prove more costeffective or have better performance than our solar modules or systems 

in addition other companies could potentially develop a highly reliable renewable energy system that mitigates the intermittent power generation drawback of many renewable energy systems or offer other valueadded improvements from the perspective of utilities and other system owners in which case such companies could compete with us even if the lcoe associated with such new systems is higher than that of our systems as a result our solar modules or systems may be negatively differentiated or rendered obsolete by the technological advances of our competitors which would reduce our net sales profitability andor market share in addition we often forward price our products and services in anticipation of future cost reductions and technology improvements and thus an inability to further refine our technology and execute our module technology and cost reduction roadmaps could adversely affect our operating results 

if our estimates regarding the future costs of collecting and recycling cdte solar modules covered by our solar module collection and recycling program are incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses and face a significant unplanned cash burden 

as necessary we fund any incremental amounts for our estimated collection and recycling obligations each year we determine the funding requirement if any based on estimated costs of collecting and recycling covered modules estimated rates of return on our restricted investments and an estimated solar module life of 25 years less amounts already funded in prior years we estimate the cost of our collection and recycling obligations based on the present value of the expected probabilityweighted future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules which includes estimates for the cost of packaging materials the cost of freight from the solar module installation sites to a recycling center the material labor capital costs the scale of recycling centers and an estimated thirdparty profit margin and return on risk for collection and recycling services we base these estimates on i our experience collecting and recycling our solar modules ii the expected timing of when our solar modules will be returned for recycling and iii the expected economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled if our estimates prove incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses and could also face a significant unplanned cash burden at the time we realize our estimates are incorrect or endusers return their modules which could adversely affect our operating results in addition participating endusers can return their modules covered under the collection and recycling program at any time as a result we could be required to collect and recycle covered cdte solar modules earlier than we expect 

 27 

our failure to protect our intellectual property rights may undermine our competitive position and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against thirdparty allegations of infringement may be costly 

protection of our proprietary processes methods and other technology is critical to our business failure to protect and monitor the use of our existing intellectual property rights could result in the loss of valuable technologies we rely primarily on patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property we regularly file patent applications to protect certain inventions arising from our rd and are currently pursuing such patent applications in various countries in accordance with our strategy for intellectual property in that jurisdiction our existing patents and future patents could be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents or if patents are issued to us such patents may not be sufficient to provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies 

we also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position although we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our associates and third parties to protect our intellectual property such confidentiality agreements are limited in duration and could be breached and may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary manufacturing expertise adequate remedies may not be available in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise in addition others may obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or legal means the failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes equipment technology trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise methods and compounds could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries especially any developing countries into which we may expand our operations in some countries we have not applied for patent trademark or copyright protection 

third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary technologies or other intellectual property rights which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology can be difficult and expensive additionally litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others we cannot ensure that the outcome of such potential litigation will be in our favor and such litigation may be costly and may divert management attention and other resources away from our business an adverse determination in any such litigation may impair our intellectual property rights and may harm our business prospects and reputation in addition we have no insurance coverage against such litigation costs and would have to bear all costs arising from such litigation to the extent we are unable to recover them from other parties 

some of our manufacturing equipment is customized and sole sourced if our manufacturing equipment fails or if our equipment suppliers fail to perform under their contracts we could experience production disruptions and be unable to satisfy our contractual requirements 

some of our manufacturing equipment including manufacturing equipment related to the production of our series 6 modules is customized to our production lines based on designs or specifications that we provide to equipment manufacturers which then undertake a specialized process to manufacture the custom equipment as a result the equipment is not readily available from multiple vendors and would be difficult to repair or replace if it were to become delayed damaged or stop working if any piece of equipment fails production along the entire production line could be interrupted in addition the failure of our equipment manufacturers to supply equipment in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms could delay our expansion or conversion plans otherwise disrupt our production schedule andor increase our manufacturing costs all of which would adversely impact our operating results 

 28 

several of our key raw materials and components are either singlesourced or sourced from a limited number of thirdparty suppliers and their failure to perform could cause manufacturing delays and impair our ability to deliver solar modules to customers in the required quality and quantities and at a price that is profitable to us 

our failure to obtain raw materials and components that meet our quality quantity and cost requirements in a timely manner could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture our solar modules or increase our manufacturing costs several of our key raw materials and components are either singlesourced or sourced from a limited number of thirdparty suppliers as a result the failure of any of our suppliers to perform could disrupt our supply chain and adversely impact our operations in addition some of our suppliers are smaller companies that may be unable to supply our increasing demand for raw materials and components as we expand our business we may be unable to identify new suppliers or qualify their products for use on our production lines in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms a constraint on our production may result in our inability to meet our capacity plans andor our obligations under our customer contracts which would have an adverse impact on our business additionally reductions in our production volume may put pressure on suppliers resulting in increased material and component costs 

a disruption in our supply chain for cdte could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture solar modules and could adversely impact our profitability and longterm growth prospects 

a key raw material used in our module production process is a cdte compound tellurium one of the main components of cdte is mainly produced as a byproduct of copper refining and therefore its supply is largely dependent upon demand for copper our supply of cdte could be limited if any of our current suppliers or any of our future suppliers are unable to acquire an adequate supply of tellurium in a timely manner or at commercially reasonable prices if our current suppliers or any of our future suppliers cannot obtain sufficient tellurium they could substantially increase prices or be unable to perform under their contracts furthermore if our competitors begin to use or increase their demand for tellurium our requirements for tellurium increase new applications for tellurium become available or adverse trade laws or policies restrict our ability to obtain tellurium from foreign vendors or make doing so cost prohibitive the supply of tellurium and related cdte compounds could be reduced and prices could increase as we may be unable to pass such increases in the costs of our raw materials through to our customers a substantial increase in tellurium prices or any limitations in the supply of tellurium could adversely impact our profitability and longterm growth objectives 

if any future production lines are not built in line with our committed schedules it may impair any future growth plans if any future production lines do not achieve operating metrics similar to our existing production lines our solar modules could perform below expectations and cause us to lose customers 

if we are unable to systematically replicate our production lines as necessary over time and achieve and sustain similar operating metrics in our future production lines as we have achieved at our existing production lines such as the future production lines at our manufacturing facility in ho chi minh city vietnam our manufacturing capacity could be substantially constrained our manufacturing costs per watt could increase and our growth could be limited such factors may result in lower net sales and lower net income than we anticipate for instance future production lines could produce solar modules that have lower conversion efficiencies higher failure rates and higher rates of degradation than solar modules from our existing production lines and we could be unable to determine the cause of the lower operating metrics or develop and implement solutions to improve performance 

our substantial international operations subject us to a number of risks including unfavorable political regulatory labor and tax conditions in the united states andor foreign countries  

we have significant manufacturing development construction sales and marketing operations both within and outside the united states and expect to continue to expand our operations worldwide as a result we are subject to the legal political social tax and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions 

 29 

risks inherent to international operations include but are not limited to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our business in foreign markets requires us to respond to rapid changes in market conditions in these countries our overall success as a global business depends in part on our ability to succeed in differing legal regulatory economic social and political conditions we may not be able to develop and implement policies and strategies that will be effective in each location where we do business 

 30 

risks related to our systems business 

project development or construction activities may not be successful projects under development may not receive required permits real property rights ppas interconnection and transmission arrangements or financing or construction may not commence or proceed as scheduled which could increase our costs and impair our ability to recover our investments  

the development and construction of solar energy generation facilities and other energy infrastructure projects involve numerous risks we may be required to spend significant sums for land and interconnection rights preliminary engineering permitting legal services and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built success in developing a particular project is contingent upon among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 31 

successful completion of a particular project may be adversely affected delayed andor rendered infeasible by numerous factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 32 

if we fail to complete the development of a solar energy project fail to meet one or more agreed upon target construction milestone dates fail to achieve systemlevel capacity or fail to meet other contract terms we may be subject to forfeiture of significant deposits under ppas or interconnection agreements or termination of such agreements incur significant liquidated damages penalties andor other obligations under other project related agreements and may not be able to recover our investment in the project if we are unable to complete the development of a solar energy project we may impair some or all of these capitalized investments which would have an adverse impact on our net income in the period in which the loss is recognized 

we may be unable to acquire or lease land obtain necessary interconnection and transmission rights andor obtain the approvals licenses permits and electric transmission grid interconnection and transmission rights necessary to build and operate pv solar power systems in a timely and cost effective manner and regulatory agencies local communities labor unions tribes or other third parties may delay prevent or increase the cost of construction and operation of the system we intend to build 

in order to construct and operate our pv solar power systems we need to acquire or lease land and rights of way obtain interconnection rights negotiate agreements with affected transmission systems and obtain all necessary local county state federal and foreign approvals licenses and permits as well as rights to interconnect the systems to the transmission grid and transmit energy generated from the system we may be unable to acquire the land or lease interests needed may not obtain or maintain satisfactory interconnection rights may have difficulty reaching agreements with affected transmission systems andor incur unexpected network upgrade costs may not receive or retain the requisite approvals permits licenses and interconnection and transmission rights or may encounter other problems that could delay or prevent us from successfully constructing and operating such systems 

many of our proposed projects are located on or require access through public lands administered by state and federal agencies pursuant to competitive public leasing and rightofway procedures and processes our projects may also be located on tribal land pursuant to land agreements that must be approved by tribal governments and federal agencies the authorization for the use construction and operation of systems and associated transmission facilities on federal tribal state and private lands will also require the assessment and evaluation of mineral rights private rightsofway and other easements environmental agricultural cultural recreational and aesthetic impacts and the likely mitigation of adverse impacts to these and other resources and uses the inability to obtain the required permits and other local state federal and tribal approvals and any excessive delays in obtaining such permits and approvals due for example to litigation or thirdparty appeals could potentially prevent us from successfully constructing and operating such systems in a timely manner and could result in the potential forfeiture of any deposit we have made with respect to a given project moreover project approvals subject to project modifications and conditions including mitigation requirements and costs could affect the financial success of a given project changing regulatory requirements and the discovery of unknown site conditions could also affect the financial success of a given project 

in addition local labor unions may increase the cost of project development in california and elsewhere we may also be subject to labor unavailability andor increased union labor requirements due to multiple simultaneous projects in a geographic region 

competition at the system level can be intense thereby potentially exerting downward pressure on systemlevel profit margins industrywide which could reduce our profitability and adversely affect our results of operations  

the significant decline in pv solar module prices over the last several years continues to create a challenging environment for module manufacturers but it has also helped drive demand for solar electricity worldwide aided by such lower module prices our customers and potential customers have in many cases been willing and able to bid aggressively for new projects and ppas using low cost assumptions for modules bos parts installation maintenance and other costs as the basis for such bids relatively low barriers to entry for solar project developers and epc companies including those we compete with have led to depending on the market and other factors intense competition at the system level which may result in an environment in which systemlevel pricing falls rapidly thereby further increasing demand for solar energy solutions but constraining the ability for project developers epc companies and vertically 

 33 

integrated solar companies such as first solar to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability accordingly while we believe our system offerings and experience are positively differentiated in many cases from that of our competitors we may fail to correctly identify our competitive position we may be unable to develop or maintain a sufficient magnitude of new system projects worldwide at economically attractive rates of return and we may not otherwise be able to achieve meaningful profitability under our longterm strategic plans 

depending on the market opportunity we may be at a disadvantage compared to potential systemlevel competitors for example certain of our competitors may have a stronger andor more established localized business presence in a particular geographic region certain of our competitors may be larger entities that have greater financial resources and greater overall brand name recognition than we do and as a result may be better positioned to impact customer behavior or adapt to changes in the industry or the economy as a whole certain competitors may also have direct or indirect access to sovereign capital andor other incentives which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time 

additionally largescale solar systems are still in their relatively early stages of existence and depending on the geographic area certain potential customers may still be in the process of educating themselves about the points of differentiation among various available providers of pv solar energy solutions including a company’s proven overall experience and bankability system design and optimization expertise grid interconnection and stabilization expertise and proven om capabilities if we are unable over time to meaningfully differentiate our offerings at scale or if available competitive pricing is prioritized over the value we believe is added through our system offerings and experience from the viewpoint of our potential customer base our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we may not be able to obtain longterm contracts for the sale of power produced by our projects at prices and on other terms favorable to attract financing and other investments  with regard to projects for which electricity is or will be sold on an open contract basis rather than under a ppa our results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent prevailing spot electricity prices decline in an unexpected manner 

obtaining longterm contracts for the sale of power produced by our projects at prices and on other terms favorable to us is essential for obtaining financing and commencing construction of our projects we must compete for ppas against other developers of solar and renewable energy projects this intense competition for ppas has resulted in downward pressure on ppa pricing for newly contracted projects in addition we believe the solar industry may experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand that put downward pressure on module pricing this downward pressure on module pricing would also create downward pressure on ppa pricing for newly contracted projects see the risk factor entitled “ competition at the system level can be intense thereby potentially exerting downward pressure on systemlevel profit margins industrywide which could reduce our profitability and adversely affect our results of operations ” for additional information if falling ppa pricing results in forecasted project revenue that is insufficient to generate returns anticipated to be demanded in the project sale market our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

other sources of power such as natural gasfired power plants have historically been cheaper than the cost of solar power and certain types of generation projects such as natural gasfired power plants can deliver power on a firm basis the inability to compete successfully against other power producers or otherwise enter into ppas favorable to us would negatively affect our ability to develop and finance our projects and negatively impact our revenue in addition the availability of ppas is dependent on utility and corporate energy procurement practices that could evolve and shift allocation of market risks over time in addition ppa availability and terms are a function of a number of economic regulatory tax and public policy factors which are also subject to change also certain of our projects may be scheduled for substantial completion prior to the commencement of a longterm ppa with a major offtaker in which case we would be required to enter into a stubperiod ppa for the intervening time period or sell down the project we may not be able to do either on terms that are commercially attractive to us finally the electricity from certain of our projects is or is expected to be sold on an open contract basis for a period of time rather than under a ppa if prevailing spot 

 34 

electricity prices relating to any such project were to decline in an unexpected manner such project may decline in value and our results of operations could otherwise be adversely affected 

lack of transmission capacity availability potential upgrade costs to the transmission grid and other systems constraints could significantly impact our ability to build pv solar power systems and generate solar electricity power sales 

in order to deliver electricity from our pv solar power systems to our customers our projects generally need to connect to the transmission grid the lack of available capacity on the transmission grid could substantially impact our projects and cause reductions in project size delays in project implementation increases in costs from transmission upgrades and potential forfeitures of any deposit we have made with respect to a given project in addition there could be unexpected costs required to complete transmission and network upgrades that adversely impact the economic viability of our pv solar power systems these transmission and network issues and costs as well as issues relating to the availability of large equipment such as transformers and switchgear could significantly impact our ability to interconnect our systems to the transmission grid build such systems and generate solar electricity sales 

our systems business is largely dependent on us and third parties arranging financing from various sources which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms or in insufficient amounts 

the construction of large utilityscale solar power projects in many cases requires project financing including nonrecourse project specific debt financing in the bank loan market and institutional debt capital markets uncertainties exist as to whether our planned projects will be able to access the debt markets in a magnitude sufficient to finance their construction if we are unable to arrange such financing or if it is only available on unfavorable terms we may be unable to fully execute our systems business plan in addition we generally expect to sell interests in our projects by raising project equity capital from taxoriented strategic industry and other equity investors such equity sources may not be available or may only be available in insufficient amounts or on unfavorable terms in which case our ability to sell interests in our projects may be delayed or limited and our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected uncertainty in or adverse changes to tax policy including the amount of itc accelerated depreciation expensing and the reduction of the us corporate income tax rate to 21 for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 under the tax act which could reduce the value of these tax related incentives may reduce project value or negatively affect our ability to timely secure equity investment for our projects even if such financing sources are available the counterparty to many of our fixedprice epc contracts which own the projects we are constructing are often special purpose vehicles that do not have significant assets other than their interests in the project and have pledged all or substantially all of these assets to secure the projectrelated debt and certain other sources of financing if the owner defaults on its payments or other obligations to us we may face difficulties in collecting payment of amounts due to us for the costs previously incurred or for the amounts previously expended or committed to be expended to purchase equipment or supplies including intercompany purchases of modules or for termination payments we are entitled to under the terms of the related epc contract if we are unable to collect the amounts owed to us or are unable to complete the project because of an owner default we may be required to record a charge against earnings related to the project which could result in a material loss 

in addition for projects to which we provide epc services but are not the project developer our epc activities are in many cases dependent on the ability of third parties to finance their system projects on acceptable terms depending on prevailing conditions in the credit markets interest rates and other factors such financing may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms or in insufficient amounts if third parties are limited in their ability to access financing to support their purchase of system construction services from us we may not realize the cash flows that we expect from such sales which could adversely affect our ability to invest in our business andor generate revenue see also the risk factor above entitled “ an increase in interest rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets including a reduction in total tax equity availability could make it difficult for customers to finance the cost of a pv solar power system and could reduce the demand for our modules or systems andor lead to a reduction in the average selling price for such offerings  ” 

 35 

developing solar power projects may require significant upfront investment prior to the signing of an epc contract and commencing construction which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our solar power project development cycles which span the time between the identification of a site location and the construction of a system vary substantially and can take years to mature as a result of these long project development cycles we may need to make significant upfront investments of resources including for example payments for land rights large transmission and ppa deposits or other payments which may be nonrefundable in advance of the signing of epc contracts commencing construction receiving cash proceeds or recognizing any revenue which may not be recognized for several additional months or years following contract signing our potential inability to enter into sales contracts with customers on favorable terms after making such upfront investments could cause us to forfeit certain nonrefundable payments or otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations furthermore we may become constrained in our ability to simultaneously fund our other business operations and these systems investments through our long project development cycles 

our liquidity may also be adversely affected to the extent the project sales market weakens and we are unable to sell interests in our solar projects on pricing timing and other terms commercially acceptable to us in such a scenario we may choose to continue to temporarily own and operate certain solar projects for a period of time after which interests in the projects may be sold to third parties 

we may be unable to accurately estimate costs under fixedprice epc agreements in which we act as the general contractor for our customers in connection with the construction and installation of their pv solar power systems 

we may enter into fixedprice epc contracts in which we act as the general contractor for our customers in connection with the installation of their pv solar power systems all essential costs are estimated at the time of entering into the epc contract for a particular project and these are reflected in the overall fixedprice that we charge our customers for the project these cost estimates are preliminary and may or may not be covered by contracts between us or the subcontractors suppliers and other parties to the project in addition we require qualified licensed subcontractors to install many of our systems shortages of such skilled labor could significantly delay a project or otherwise increase our costs should actual results prove different from our estimates including those due to unexpected increases in inflation commodity prices or labor costs or we experience delays in execution and we are unable to commensurately increase the epc sales price we may not achieve our expected margins or we may be required to record a loss in the relevant fiscal period 

we may be subject to unforeseen costs liabilities or obligations when providing om services in addition certain of our om agreements include provisions permitting the counterparty to terminate the agreement without cause 

we may provide ongoing om services to system owners under separate service agreements pursuant to which we generally perform standard activities associated with operating a pv solar power system including 247 monitoring and control compliance activities energy forecasting and scheduled and unscheduled maintenance our costs to perform these services are estimated at the time of entering into the om agreement for a particular project and these are reflected in the price we charge our customers including certain agreements which feature fixed pricing should our estimates of om costs prove inaccurate including any unexpected serial defects unavailability of parts or increases in inflation labor or bos costs our growth strategy and results of operations could be adversely affected because of the potentially longterm nature of these om agreements the adverse impacts on our results of operations could be significant particularly if our costs are not capped under the terms of the agreements in addition certain of our om agreements include provisions permitting the counterparty to terminate the agreement without cause or for convenience the exercise of such termination rights or the use of such rights as leverage to renegotiate terms and conditions of the om agreement including pricing terms could adversely impact our results of operations we may also be subject to substantial costs in the event we do not achieve certain thresholds under the effective availability guarantees included in our om agreements 

 36 

our systems business is subject to regulatory oversight and liability if we fail to operate pv solar power systems in compliance with electric reliability rules 

the ongoing om services that we provide for system owners may subject us to regulation by the nerc or its designated regional representative as a “generator operator” or “gop” under electric reliability rules filed with ferc our failure to comply with the reliability rules applicable to gops could subject us to substantial fines by nerc subject to ferc’s review in addition the system owners that receive our om services may be regulated by nerc as “generator owners” or “gos” and we may incur liability for go violations and fines levied by nerc subject to ferc’s review based on the terms of our om agreements finally as a system owner and operator we may in the future be subject to regulation by nerc as a go 

risks related to regulations 

existing regulations and policies changes thereto and new regulations and policies may present technical regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of pv products or systems which may significantly reduce demand for our modules systems or services 

the market for electricity generation products is heavily influenced by local state federal and foreign government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry as well as policies promulgated by electric utilities these regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and interconnection of customerowned electricity generation in the united states and in a number of other countries these regulations and policies have been modified in the past and may be modified again in the future these regulations and policies could deter enduser purchases of pv products or systems and investment in the rd of pv solar technology for example without a mandated regulatory exception for pv solar power systems utility customers are often charged interconnection or standby fees for putting distributed power generation on the electric utility grid if these interconnection standby fees were applicable to pv solar power systems it is likely that they would increase the cost of using such systems for endusers which could make the systems less desirable thereby adversely affecting our business financial condition and results of operations in addition with respect to utilities that utilize a peakhour pricing policy or timeofuse pricing methods whereby the price of electricity is adjusted based on electricity supply and demand electricity generated by pv solar power systems currently benefits from competing primarily with expensive peakhour electricity rather than the less expensive average price of electricity modifications to the peakhour pricing policies of utilities such as to a flat rate for all times of the day would require pv solar power systems to achieve lower prices in order to compete with the price of electricity from other sources and would adversely impact our operating results 

our modules systems and services such as om are subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with national and local ordinances relating to building codes safety environmental protection utility interconnection and metering and other matters and tracking the requirements of individual jurisdictions is complex any new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to our modules systems or services may result in significant additional expenses to us or our customers and as a result could cause a significant reduction in demand for our modules systems or services in addition any regulatory compliance failure could result in significant management distraction unplanned costs andor reputational damage 

we could be adversely affected by any violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” the uk bribery act and other foreign antibribery laws  

the fcpa generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business other countries in which we operate also have antibribery laws some of which prohibit improper payments to government and nongovernment persons and entities and others eg the fcpa and the uk bribery act extend their application to activities outside of their country of origin our policies mandate compliance with all applicable antibribery laws we currently operate in and pursuant to our longterm strategic plans may further expand into key parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with 

 37 

local customs and practices in addition due to the level of regulation in our industry our operations in certain jurisdictions including india china south america and the middle east require substantial government contact either directly by us or through intermediaries over whom we have less direct control such as subcontractors agents and partners such as joint venture partners where norms can differ from us standards although we have implemented policies procedures and in certain cases contractual arrangements designed to facilitate compliance with these antibribery laws our officers directors associates subcontractors agents and partners may take actions in violation of our policies procedures contractual arrangements and antibribery laws any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could subject us and such persons to criminal andor civil penalties or other sanctions potentially by government prosecutors from more than one country which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and reputation 

environmental obligations and liabilities could have a substantial negative impact on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations  

our operations involve the use handling generation processing storage transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations at the local state national and international levels these environmental laws and regulations include those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the use management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites and occupational health and safety as we execute our longterm strategic plans and expand our business into foreign jurisdictions worldwide our environmental compliance burden may continue to increase both in terms of magnitude and complexity we have incurred and may continue to incur significant costs in complying with these laws and regulations in addition violations of or liabilities under environmental laws or permits may result in restrictions being imposed on our operating activities or in our being subjected to substantial fines penalties criminal proceedings thirdparty property damage or personal injury claims cleanup costs or other costs such solutions could also result in substantial delay or termination of projects under construction within our systems business which could adversely impact our results of operations while we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements future developments such as more aggressive enforcement policies the implementation of new more stringent laws and regulations or the discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our solar modules contain cdte and other semiconductor materials elemental cadmium and certain of its compounds are regulated as hazardous materials due to the adverse health effects that may arise from human exposure based on existing research the risks of exposure to cdte are not believed to be as serious as those relating to exposure to elemental cadmium in our manufacturing operations we maintain engineering controls to minimize our associates’ exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds and require our associates who handle cadmium compounds to follow certain safety procedures including the use of personal protective equipment such as respirators chemical goggles and protective clothing relevant studies and thirdparty peer review of our technology have concluded that the risk of exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds from our endproducts is negligible in addition the risk of exposure is further minimized by the encapsulated nature of these materials in our products the physical properties of cadmium compounds used in our products and the recycling or responsible disposal of our modules while we believe that these factors and procedures are sufficient to protect our associates endusers and the general public from adverse health effects that may arise from cadmium exposure we cannot ensure that human or environmental exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds used in our products will not occur any such exposure could result in future thirdparty claims against us damage to our reputation and heightened regulatory scrutiny which could limit or impair our ability to sell and distribute our products the occurrence of future events such as these could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the use of cadmium or cadmium compounds in various products is also coming under increasingly stringent governmental regulation future regulation in this area could impact the manufacturing sale collection and recycling of solar modules and could require us to make unforeseen environmental expenditures or limit our ability to sell and distribute our products for example european union directive 201165eu on the restriction of the use of hazardous 

 38 

substances in electrical and electronic equipment recast rohs directive restricts the use of certain hazardous substances including cadmium and its compounds in specified products other jurisdictions such as china have adopted similar legislation or are considering doing so currently pv solar modules are explicitly excluded from the scope of recast rohs article 2 as adopted by the european parliament and the council in june 2011 the next general review of the rohs directive is scheduled for 2021 involving a broader discussion of the existing scope a scope review focusing on additional exclusions was proposed by the european commission in 2017 under the eu’s codecision process which allows the european parliament and the european council to amend the european commission’s proposal on exclusions the codecision procedure was completed in 2017 and the existing exclusion of pv modules was maintained if pv modules were to be included in the scope of future rohs revisions without an exemption or exclusion we would be required to redesign our solar modules to reduce cadmium and other affected hazardous substances to the maximum allowable concentration thresholds in the rohs directive in order to continue to offer them for sale within the eu as such actions would be impractical this type of regulatory development would effectively close the eu market to us which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as an owner and operator of pv solar power systems that deliver electricity to the grid certain of our affiliated entities may be regulated as public utilities under us federal and state law which could adversely affect the cost of doing business and limit our growth  

as an owner and operator of pv solar power systems that deliver electricity to the grid certain of our affiliated entities may be considered public utilities for purposes of the federal power act as amended the “fpa” and public utility companies for purposes of the public utility holding company act of 2005 “puhca 2005” and are subject to regulation by the ferc as well as various local and state regulatory bodies 

some of our affiliated entities may be exempt wholesale generators or qualifying facilities under the public utility regulatory policies act of 1978 as amended “purpa” and as such are exempt from regulation under puhca 2005 in addition our affiliated entities may be exempt from most provisions of the fpa as well as state laws regarding the financial or organizational regulation of public utilities we are not directly subject to ferc regulation under the fpa however we are considered to be a “holding company” for purposes of section 203 of the fpa which regulates certain transactions involving public utilities and such regulation could adversely affect our ability to grow the business through acquisitions likewise investors seeking to acquire our public utility subsidiaries or acquire ownership interests in our securities sufficient to give them control over us and our public utility subsidiaries may require prior ferc approval to do so such approval could result in transaction delays or uncertainties 

public utilities under the fpa are required to obtain ferc acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of electricity and to comply with various regulations the ferc may grant our affiliated entities the authority to sell electricity at marketbased rates and may also grant them certain regulatory waivers such as waivers from compliance with ferc’s accounting regulations these ferc orders reserve the right to revoke or revise marketbased sales authority if the ferc subsequently determines that our affiliated entities can exercise market power in the sale of generation products the provision of transmission services or if it finds that any of the entities can create barriers to entry by competitors in addition if the entities fail to comply with certain reporting obligations the ferc may revoke their power sales tariffs finally if the entities were deemed to have engaged in manipulative or deceptive practices concerning their power sales transactions they would be subject to potential fines disgorgement of profits andor suspension or revocation of their marketbased rate authority if our affiliated entities were to lose their marketbased rate authority such companies would be required to obtain the ferc’s acceptance of a costofservice rate schedule and could become subject to the accounting recordkeeping and reporting requirements that are imposed on utilities with costbased rate schedules which would impose cost and compliance burdens on us and have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition to the risks described above we may be subject to additional regulatory regimes at state or foreign levels to the extent we own and operate pv solar power systems in such jurisdictions 

 39 

other risks 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future business combinations or acquisition transactions and integration of business combinations may disrupt our business and management 

we have made several acquisitions in prior years and in the future we may acquire additional companies project pipelines products or technologies or enter into joint ventures or other strategic initiatives we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such business combinations or acquisitions and each transaction has numerous risks the risks associated with such transactions may include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 40 

mergers and acquisitions of companies are inherently risky and ultimately if we do not complete the integration of acquired businesses successfully and in a timely manner we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions to the extent anticipated which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations in addition we may seek to dispose of our interests in acquired companies project pipelines products or technologies we may not recover our initial investment in such interests in part or at all which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we may be unable to complete the sale of our interests in 8point3 energy partners lp on the terms and in the timeframe anticipated or at all and if we are unable to complete such sale we may continue to hold the interests and may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the formation of the partnership or the sale could result in shareholder litigation  

in june 2015 the partnership formed by the sponsors completed its initial public offering the “ipo” the yieldco is a joint venture vehicle into which we and sunpower each contributed a portfolio of selected solar generation assets from our existing portfolios of assets since the formation of the partnership we and sunpower have from time to time sold interests in solar projects to the partnership we launched the yieldco to enable a competitive cost of capital and greater optionality in the project sales process for a portion of our future project sales 

in february 2018 we entered into an agreement the “merger agreement” with cd clean energy and infrastructure v jv llc an equity fund managed by capital dynamics and certain other coinvestors and certain other parties pursuant to which such parties agreed to acquire our interests in the partnership and its subsidiaries the “transaction” the closing of the transaction is subject to various conditions including among others approval by the yieldco’s shareholders and the receipt of consents from third parties and governmental approvals including approval under the hartscottrodino antitrust improvements act of 1976 ferc section 203 approval and the approval of the committee on foreign investment in the united states known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors could impact the satisfaction of these conditions and therefore the expected timing and likelihood of completion of the transaction failure or delay to satisfy these or other conditions may have adverse consequences including that the market price of the yieldco’s shares may decline to the extent that their current market price reflects a market assumption that the transaction will be completed certain costs relating to the transaction such as certain financial advisor and legal fees must be paid even if the transaction is not completed and our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected the yieldco and capital dynamics also have the ability to terminate the merger agreement in certain circumstances if we are unable to close the transaction we may continue to hold the interests and may not be able to realize the strategic and financial benefits that we expect to derive from our yieldco strategy and our investment in the yieldco if the transaction is not completed we will have to reassess our longterm strategy with respect to our continued ownership of our interests in the yieldco 

in addition we may be subject to class action lawsuits relating to the transaction and other additional lawsuits that may be filed such litigation is common in connection with acquisitions of public companies regardless of any merits related to the underlying acquisition while we will evaluate and defend against any actions vigorously the costs of the defense of such lawsuits and other effects of such litigation could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

the viability of the yieldco strategy and the transaction are also subject to the risks described in the yieldco’s annual report on form 10k in addition due to the joint venture nature of the yieldco we do not exercise control over the yieldco in the same manner that we could over our whollyowned subsidiaries and as such the viability of the yieldco strategy and the transaction also depend in part on our ability to effectively manage our business relationships with sunpower if we are unable to achieve the strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the yieldco strategy and the transaction our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected see note 12 “investments in unconsolidated affiliates and joint ventures”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding the partnership 

 41 

we are subject to litigation risks including securities class actions and stockholder derivative actions which may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain 

from time to time we are subject to legal claims with and without merit that may be costly and which may divert the attention of our management and our resources in general in addition our projects may be subject to litigation or other adverse proceedings that may adversely impact our ability to proceed with construction or sell a given project which may adversely affect our ability to recognize revenue with respect to such project the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict moreover many of the complaints filed against us do not specify the amount of damages that plaintiffs seek and we therefore are unable to estimate the possible range of damages that might be incurred should these lawsuits be resolved against us certain of these lawsuits assert types of claims that if resolved against us could give rise to substantial damages and an unfavorable outcome or settlement of one or more of these lawsuits or any future lawsuits may result in a significant monetary judgment or award against us or a significant monetary payment by us and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations even if these lawsuits or any future lawsuits are not resolved against us the costs of defending such lawsuits may be significant and may not be covered by our insurance policies because the price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile we can provide no assurance that additional securities or other litigation will not be filed against us in the future see note 15 “commitments and contingencies – legal proceedings”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for more information on our legal proceedings including our securities class action and derivative actions 

our future success depends on our ability to retain our key associates and to successfully integrate them into our management team 

we are dependent on the services of our executive officers and other members of our senior management team the loss of one or more of these key associates or any other member of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business we may not be able to retain or replace these key associates and may not have adequate succession plans in place several of our current key associates including our executive officers are subject to employment conditions or arrangements that contain postemployment noncompetition provisions however these arrangements permit the associates to terminate their employment with us upon little or no notice and the enforceability of the noncompetition provisions in certain jurisdictions is uncertain 

if we are unable to attract train and retain key personnel our business may be materially and adversely affected any regulatory compliance failure with respect to applicable labor laws and regulations including the davisbacon and related acts could have an adverse effect on us 

our future success depends to a significant extent on our ability to attract train and retain management operations sales training and technical personnel including personnel in foreign jurisdictions recruiting and retaining capable personnel particularly those with expertise in the pv solar industry across a variety of technologies are vital to our success there is substantial competition for qualified technical personnel and while we continue to benchmark our organization against the broad spectrum of business in our market space to remain economically competitive there can be no assurances that we will be able to attract and retain our technical personnel if we are unable to attract and retain qualified associates or otherwise experience unexpected labor disruptions within our business we may be materially and adversely affected 

labor used on some of our job sites may be subject to the davisbacon and related acts collectively “davisbacon” davisbacon requires that personnel assigned to the project be paid at least the prevailing wage and fringe benefits as established by and in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the us department of labor “dol” we have an established policy pursuant to which we evaluate davisbacon requirements in conjunction with our subcontractors and ensure our collective compliance with these requirements if it is determined that any person working under davisbacon requirements on first solar projects is not properly classified is being paid the incorrect prevailing wage or has not been paid fringe benefits to which he or she was entitled we could incur additional liability with respect to such worker or be exposed to other adverse outcomes 

 42 

we may be exposed to infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties which if determined adversely to us could cause us to pay significant damage awards or prohibit us from the manufacture and sale of our solar modules or the use of our technology 

our success depends largely on our ability to use and develop our technology and knowhow without infringing or misappropriating the intellectual property rights of third parties the validity and scope of claims relating to pv solar technology patents involve complex scientific legal and factual considerations and analysis and therefore may be highly uncertain we may be subject to litigation involving claims of patent infringement or violation of intellectual property rights of third parties the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits patent opposition proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings can be both costly and time consuming and may significantly divert the efforts and resources of our technical and management personnel an adverse determination in any such litigation or proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liability to third parties require us to seek licenses from third parties which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all or pay ongoing royalties require us to redesign our solar modules or subject us to injunctions prohibiting the manufacture and sale of our solar modules or the use of our technologies protracted litigation could also result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of our solar modules until the resolution of such litigation 

currency translation and transaction risk may negatively affect our results of operations 

although our reporting currency is the us dollar we conduct certain business and incur costs in the local currency of most countries in which we operate as a result we are subject to currency translation and transaction risk for example certain of our net sales in 2017  were denominated in foreign currencies such as euros and indian rupees  and we expect to continue to have net sales denominated in foreign currencies in the future joint ventures or other business arrangements with strategic partners outside of the united states have involved and in the future may involve significant investments denominated in local currencies changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar could affect our results of operations and result in exchange gains or losses we cannot accurately predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations 

we could also expand our business into emerging markets many of which have an uncertain regulatory environment relating to currency policy conducting business in such emerging markets could cause our exposure to changes in exchange rates to increase due to the relatively high volatility associated with emerging market currencies and potentially longer payment terms for our proceeds 

our ability to hedge foreign currency exposure is dependent on our credit profile with the banks that are willing and able to do business with us deterioration in our credit position or a significant tightening of the credit market conditions could limit our ability to hedge our foreign currency exposures and therefore result in exchange gains or losses 

our largest stockholder has significant influence over us and his interests may conflict with or differ from interests of other stockholders 

our largest stockholder lukas t walton the “significant stockholder” owned approximately 22  of our outstanding common stock as of december 31 2017  as a result the significant stockholder has substantial influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of our directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions such as mergers tender offers and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets the interests of the significant stockholder could conflict with or differ from interests of other stockholders for example the concentration of ownership held by the significant stockholder could delay defer or prevent a change of control of our company or impede a merger takeover or other business combination which other stockholders may view favorably 

 43 

if our longlived assets or project related assets become impaired we may be required to record significant charges to earnings 

we may be required to record significant charges to earnings should we determine that our longlived assets or project related assets are impaired such charges may have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations we review longlived and project related assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable we consider a project commercially viable or recoverable if it is anticipated to be sold for a profit once it is either fully developed or fully constructed or if the expected operating cash flows from future power generation exceed the cost basis of the asset if our projects are not considered commercially viable we would be required to impair the respective assets 

unanticipated changes in our tax provisions the enactment of new tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the jurisdictions in which we operate in december 2017 the us government enacted the tax act the changes included in the tax act are broad and complex and the final effects of the tax act including those related to the mandatory onetime transition tax on certain accumulated earnings and profits of foreign corporate subsidiaries that may electively be paid over eight years may differ from the estimates provided elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k possibly materially due to among other things changes in interpretations of the tax act any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the tax act any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the tax act any updates or changes to estimates utilized to calculate provisional amounts or actions we may take as a result of the tax act additionally longstanding international tax laws that determine each country’s jurisdictional tax rights in crossborder international trade are evolving as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting reporting requirements recommended by the organisation for economic cooperation and development as these and other tax laws and regulations change our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we are subject to potential tax examinations in various jurisdictions and taxing authorities may disagree with our interpretations of us and foreign tax laws and may assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these examinations in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however the outcome of tax examinations cannot be predicted with certainty therefore the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of such examinations could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision which could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

in addition our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure losses of tax holidays changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings among countries with tax holidays or differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process any changes in our effective tax rate may materially and adversely impact our results of operations 

cyberattacks or other breaches of our information systems or those of third parties with which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our operations rely on our computer systems hardware software and networks as well as those of the third parties with which we do business to securely process store and transmit proprietary confidential and other information including intellectual property such information systems may be compromised by cyberattacks computer viruses and other events that could be materially disruptive to our business operations and could put the security of our information and that of the third parties with which we do business at risk of misappropriation or destruction in recent years such cyber incidents have become increasingly frequent and sophisticated targeting or otherwise affecting a wide range of companies while we have instituted security measures to minimize the likelihood and impact of a cyber incident there is no assurance that these measures or those of the third parties with which we do business will be adequate in the future if these measures fail valuable information may be lost our manufacturing development 

 44 

construction om and other operations may be disrupted and our reputation may suffer we may also be subject to litigation regulatory action remedial expenses and financial losses beyond the scope or limits of our insurance coverage these consequences of a failure of security measures could individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

changes in or any failure to comply with privacy laws regulations and standards may adversely affect our business 

personal privacy and data security have become significant issues in the united states europe and in many other jurisdictions in which we operate the regulatory framework for privacy and security issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future for example in 2015 the court of justice of the european union ruled that the useu safe harbor framework which provided us companies with a streamlined means of complying with the eu’s data protection directive regarding the treatment of customers’ and employees’ personal information and other privacy matters and upon which we relied for the transfer of personal data from the eu to the us was invalid as a result of such invalidation we have implemented data transfer agreements between certain of our us and eu based entities furthermore state federal or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted and may in the future adopt laws and regulations affecting data privacy all of which may be subject to invalidation by relevant foreign judicial bodies industry organizations also regularly adopt and advocate for new standards in this area 

in the united states these include rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of federal agencies and state attorneys general and legislatures and consumer protection agencies internationally many jurisdictions in which we operate have established their own data security and privacy legal framework with which we or our customers must comply including but not limited to the data protection directive established in the eu and data protection legislation of the individual member states subject to such directive the data protection directive will be replaced in may 2018  by the pending european general data protection regulation a broadbased data privacy regime that will impose additional obligations penalties and risk upon our business in many jurisdictions enforcement actions and consequences for noncompliance are also rising in addition to government regulation privacy advocates and industry groups may propose new and different selfregulatory standards that either legally or contractually apply to us any inability or perceived inability to adequately address privacy and security concerns even if unfounded or comply with applicable privacy and data security laws regulations and policies could result in additional cost and liability to us damage our reputation inhibit sales and adversely affect our business 

our credit agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business 

we may be unable to respond to changes in business and economic conditions engage in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us and obtain additional financing if needed because the senior secured credit facility made available under our amended and restated credit agreement with several financial institutions as lenders and jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent the “revolving credit facility” and certain of our project financing arrangements contain and other future debt agreements may contain covenant restrictions that limit our ability to among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 45 

under our revolving credit facility and certain of our project financing arrangements we are also subject to certain financial covenants our ability to comply with covenants under our credit agreements is dependent on our future performance or the performance of specifically financed projects which will be subject to many factors some of which are beyond our control including prevailing economic conditions in addition our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under these agreements and any of our other future debt agreements which if not cured or waived could permit the holders thereof to accelerate such debt and could cause crossdefaults under our other facility agreements and the possible acceleration of debt under such agreements as well as crossdefaults under certain of our key project and operational agreements and could also result in requirements to post additional security instruments to secure future obligations in addition we cannot assure you that events that occur within the company or in the industry or the economy as a whole will not constitute material adverse effects under these agreements if it is determined that a material adverse effect has occurred the lenders can under certain circumstances restrict future borrowings or accelerate the due date of outstanding amounts if any of our debt is accelerated we may not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt and may experience crossdefaults under our other debt or operational agreements which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations

executive overview 

we are a leading global provider of comprehensive pv solar energy solutions we design manufacture and sell pv solar modules with an advanced thin film semiconductor technology and also develop design construct and sell pv solar power systems that primarily use the modules we manufacture additionally we provide om services to system owners we have substantial ongoing rd efforts focused on module and systemlevel innovations we are the world’s largest thin film pv solar module manufacturer and one of the world’s largest pv solar module manufacturers our mission is to provide costadvantaged solar technology through innovation customer engagement industry leadership and operational excellence 

certain highlights of our financial results and other key operational developments for the year ended december 31 2017  include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

market overview 

the solar industry continues to be characterized by intense pricing competition both at the module and system levels in particular module average selling prices in the united states and several other key markets have experienced an accelerated decline in recent years and module average selling prices are expected to continue to decline globally to some degree in the future in the aggregate we believe manufacturers of solar cells and modules have significant installed production capacity relative to global demand and the ability for additional capacity expansion we believe the solar industry may from time to time experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity exceeds global demand and that such periods will put pressure on pricing additionally intense competition at the system level may result in an environment in which pricing falls rapidly thereby further 

 50 

increasing demand for solar energy solutions but constraining the ability for project developers epc companies and verticallyintegrated solar companies such as first solar to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability in light of such market realities we are focusing on our strategies and points of differentiation which include our advanced module and system technologies our manufacturing process our verticallyintegrated business model our financial viability and the sustainability of our modules and systems 

worldwide solar markets continue to develop in part aided by demand elasticity resulting from declining industry average selling prices both at the module and system levels which make solar power more affordable we are developing constructing and operating multiple solar projects around the world as we continue to execute on our advancedstage utilityscale project pipeline we expect a significant portion of our future consolidated net sales operating income and cash flows to be derived from such projects we also continue to develop our earlytomidstage project pipeline and evaluate acquisitions of projects to further expand both our earlytomidstage and advancedstage project pipelines see the tables under “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – systems project pipeline” for additional information about projects within our advancedstage project pipeline 

lower industry module and system pricing while currently challenging for certain solar manufacturers particularly manufacturers with higher cost structures is expected to continue to contribute to diversification in global electricity generation and further demand for solar energy solutions over time we believe that solar energy generation will experience widespread adoption in those applications where it competes economically with traditional forms of energy generation in the near term however declining average selling prices are expected to adversely affect our results of operations relative to prior years if competitors reduce pricing to levels below their costs bid aggressively low prices for module sale agreements epc agreements and ppas or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time our results of operations could be further adversely affected in certain markets in california and elsewhere an oversupply imbalance at the grid level may further contribute to reduce shorttomedium term demand for new solar installations relative to prior years lower ppa pricing and lower margins on module and system sales to such markets we continue to mitigate these uncertainties in part by executing on our module technology improvements including our transition to series 6 module manufacturing continuing the development of key markets and implementing certain other cost reduction initiatives including both manufacturing bos and other operating costs 

we face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules and developers of solar power projects solar module manufacturers compete with one another on price and on several module value attributes including conversion efficiency energy yield and reliability and developers of systems compete on various factors such as net present value return on equity and lcoe as noted above competition on the basis of selling price per watt has intensified in recent years which has contributed to declines in module average selling prices in several key markets many crystalline silicon cell and wafer manufacturers are transitioning from lower efficiency bsf multicrystalline cells the legacy technology against which we have generally competed in our markets to higher efficiency perc multicrystalline and monocrystalline cells at competitive cost structures additionally while conventional solar modules including the solar modules we produce are monofacial meaning their ability to produce energy is a function of direct and diffuse irradiance on their front side certain manufacturers of monocrystalline perc solar modules are pursuing the commercialization of bifacial modules that also capture diffuse irradiance on the back side of a module we believe the cost effective manufacture of bifacial perc modules is being enabled by the expansion of inexpensive crystal growth and diamond wire saw capacity in china bifaciality compromises nameplate efficiency but by converting both front and rear side irradiance such technology can improve the overall energy production of a module relative to nameplate efficiency when applied in certain applications and bos configurations which could potentially lower the overall lcoe of a system when compared to systems using conventional solar modules including the modules we produce 

we believe we are among the lowest cost pv module manufacturers in the solar industry on a module cost per watt basis based on publicly available information this cost competitiveness allows us to compete favorably in markets where pricing for modules and fully integrated pv solar power systems is highly competitive our cost competitiveness is based in large part on our module conversion efficiency proprietary manufacturing technology which enables us to 

 51 

produce a cdte module in less than 35  hours using a continuous and highly automated industrial manufacturing process as opposed to a batch process and our operational excellence in addition our cdte modules use approximately 12  of the amount of semiconductor material that is used to manufacture traditional crystalline silicon solar modules the cost of polysilicon is a significant driver of the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules and the timing and rate of change in the cost of silicon feedstock and polysilicon could lead to changes in solar module pricing levels polysilicon costs have had periods of decline over the past several years and polysilicon consumption per cell has been reduced through various initiatives such as the adoption of diamond wire saw technology contributing to a decline in our relative manufacturing cost competitiveness over traditional crystalline silicon module manufacturers 

given the smaller size sometimes referred to as form factor of our current series 4 modules compared to certain types of crystalline silicon modules we may incur higher labor and bos costs associated with the construction of systems using our series 4 modules thus to compete effectively on an lcoe basis our series 4 modules may need to maintain a certain cost advantage per watt compared to crystalline siliconbased modules with larger form factors we recently introduced our next generation series 6 module technology which is expected to enable the production of modules with a larger form factor along with better product attributes and a lower manufacturing cost structure accordingly the larger form factor of our series 6 modules is expected to reduce the number of electrical connections and hardware required for system installation the resulting labor and material savings are expected to represent a significant improvement compared to current technologies and a substantial reduction in total installed system costs resulting in improved project returns as bos costs represent a significant portion of the costs associated with the construction of a typical utilityscale system 

in terms of energy yield in many climates our cdte modules provide a significant energy production advantage over most conventional crystalline silicon solar modules including bsf and perc technologies of equivalent efficiency rating for example our cdte solar modules provide a superior temperature coefficient which results in stronger system performance in typical high insolation climates as the majority of a system’s generation on average occurs when module temperatures are well above 25°c standard test conditions in addition our cdte modules provide a superior spectral response in humid environments where atmospheric moisture alters the solar spectrum relative to laboratory standards our cdte solar modules also provide a better shading response than conventional crystalline silicon solar modules which may lose up to three times as much power as cdte solar modules when shading occurs as a result of these and other factors our pv solar power systems typically produce more annual energy in real world field conditions than competing systems with the same nameplate capacity 

while our modules and systems are generally competitive in cost reliability and performance attributes there can be no guarantee such competitiveness will continue to exist in the future to the same extent or at all any declines in the competitiveness of our products could result in additional margin compression further declines in the average selling prices of our modules and systems erosion in our market share for modules and systems andor declines in overall net sales we continue to focus on enhancing the competitiveness of our solar modules and systems by accelerating progress along our module technology and cost reduction roadmaps continuing to make technological advances at the system level using innovative installation techniques and knowhow and leveraging volume procurement around standardized hardware platforms 

certain trends and uncertainties 

we believe that our operations may be favorably or unfavorably impacted by the following trends and uncertainties that may affect our financial condition and results of operations see item 1a “risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of other risks that may affect our financial condition and results of operations 

our longterm strategic plans are focused on our goal to create longterm shareholder value through a balance of growth profitability and liquidity in executing such plans we are focusing on providing utilityscale pv solar energy solutions using our modules in key geographic markets that we believe have a compelling need for massscale pv electricity including markets throughout the americas the asiapacific region and certain other strategic markets additionally 

 52 

we are focusing on opportunities in which our pv solar energy solutions can compete directly with traditional forms of energy generation on an lcoe or similar basis or complement such generation offerings such focus on our core module and utilityscale offerings exists within a current market environment that includes rooftop and distributed generation solar particularly in the united states while it is unclear how rooftop and distributed generation solar might impact our core utilityscale based offerings in the next several years we believe that utilityscale solar will continue to be a compelling solar offering for companies with technology and cost leadership and will continue to represent an increasing portion of the overall electricity generation mix additionally our ability to provide utilityscale offerings on economically attractive terms depends in part on certain market factors outside of our control such as interest rate fluctuations domestic or international trade policies and government support programs adverse changes in these factors could increase the cost of utilityscale systems which could reduce demand for such systems and limit the number of potential buyers 

we are closely evaluating and managing the appropriate level of resources required as we pursue the most advantageous and cost effective projects and partnerships in our key markets we have dedicated and intend to continue to dedicate significant capital and human resources to reduce the total installed cost of pv solar energy to optimize the design and logistics around our pv solar energy solutions and to ensure that our solutions integrate well into the overall electricity ecosystem of each specific market we expect that over time the majority of our consolidated net sales operating income and cash flows will come from solar offerings in the key geographic markets described above the timing execution and financial impacts of our longterm strategic plans are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in item 1a “risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k we are focusing our resources in those markets and energy applications in which solar power can be a leastcost bestfit energy solution particularly in regions with significant current or projected electricity demand relatively high existing electricity prices strong demand for renewable energy generation and high solar resources 

creating or maintaining a market position in certain strategically targeted markets and energy applications also requires us to adapt to new and changing market conditions for example our offerings from time to time may need to be competitively priced at levels associated with minimal gross profit margins which may adversely affect our results of operations we expect the profitability associated with our various sales offerings to vary from one another over time and possibly vary from our internal longrange profitability expectations and targets depending on the market opportunity and the relative competitiveness of our offerings compared with other energy solutions traditional or otherwise that are available to potential customers in addition as we execute on our longterm strategic plans we will continue to monitor and adapt to any changing dynamics in emerging technologies such as commercially viable energy storage solutions which are expected to further enable pv solar power systems to compete with traditional forms of energy generation by shifting the delivery of energy generated by such systems to periods of greater demand such storage solutions continue to evolve in terms of technology and cost and global deployments of storage capacity are expected to exceed 100 gw  by 2030 representing a significant increase in the potential market for renewable energy we will also continue to monitor and adapt to any changing dynamics in the market set of potential buyers of solar projects market environments with few potential project buyers and a higher cost of capital would generally exert downward pressure on the potential revenue from the solar projects we are developing whereas conversely market environments with many potential project buyers and a lower cost of capital would likely have a favorable impact on the potential revenue from such solar projects 

on occasion we may temporarily own and operate certain systems with the intention to sell them at a later date we may also elect to construct and temporarily retain ownership interests in partially contracted or uncontracted systems for which there is a partial or no ppa with an offtaker such as a utility but rather an intent to sell a portion of or all the electricity produced by the system on an open contract basis until the system is sold expected revenue from projects without a ppa for the full offtake of the system is subject to greater variability and uncertainty based on market factors and is typically lower than projects with a fully contracted ppa additionally our joint ventures and other business arrangements with strategic partners have and may in the future result in us temporarily retaining a noncontrolling ownership interest in the underlying systems projects we develop supply modules to or construct potentially for a period of up to several years in each of the above mentioned examples we may retain such ownership interests in a consolidated or unconsolidated separate entity 

 53 

we continually evaluate forecasted global demand competition and our addressable market and seek to effectively balance manufacturing capacity with market demand and the nature and extent of our competition in july 2017 we announced our plans to utilize our idled vietnamese manufacturing plant for production of our next generation series 6 module technology this decision is expected to provide us with several operational benefits including i the ability to add additional series 6 production lines without ramping down current series 4 production ii flexibility in production capacity during our series 6 transition period and iii installing series 6 production lines in a facility that is substantially identical to our malaysian manufacturing plant where such lines are currently being installed which is expected to accelerate and facilitate a costeffective installation our vietnamese plant including the recently announced expansion of a second series 6 production line at the facility and any other potential investments to add or otherwise modify our manufacturing capacity in response to market demand and competition may require significant internal and possibly external sources of liquidity and may be subject to certain risks and uncertainties described in item 1a “risk factors” including those described under the headings “ our future success depends on our ability to effectively balance manufacturing production with market demand convert existing production facilities to support new product lines such as our transition to series 6 module manufacturing and when necessary continue to build new manufacturing plants over time in response to such demand and add production lines in a costeffective manner all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties ” and “ if any future production lines are not built in line with our committed schedules it may impair any future growth plans if any future production lines do not achieve operating metrics similar to our existing production lines our solar modules could perform below expectations and cause us to lose customers ” 

8point3 energy partners lp 

in june 2015 the 8point energy partners lp or “the partnership” completed its ipo as part of the offering we contributed interests in various projects to a subsidiary of the partnership in exchange for an ownership interest in the entity since the formation of the partnership the sponsors have from time to time sold interests in solar projects to the partnership which owns and operates a portfolio of solar energy generation projects 

in february 2018 we entered into an agreement with cd clean energy and infrastructure v jv llc an equity fund managed by capital dynamics and certain other coinvestors and certain other parties pursuant to which such parties agreed to acquire our interests in the partnership and its subsidiaries in connection with the transaction we entered into an agreement with capital dynamics and certain other parties whereby we and sunpower have agreed among other things to vote to approve the merger agreement at any meeting of shareholders of the partnership for such purpose as shareholders of the partnership and holders of equity units in opco 

for additional information on the partnership see item 1a “risk factors – we may be unable to complete the sale of our interests in 8point3 energy partners lp on the terms and in the timeframe anticipated or at all and if we are unable to complete such sale we may continue to hold the interests and may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the formation of the partnership or the sale could result in shareholder litigation ” and note 12 “investments in unconsolidated affiliates and joint ventures  – 8point3 energy partners lp” to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

systems project pipeline 

the following tables summarize as of february 22 2018  our approximately 22 gw  advancedstage project pipeline the actual volume of modules installed in our projects will be greater than the project size in mw ac  as module volumes required for a project are based upon mw dc  which will be greater than the mw ac  size pursuant to a dcac ratio typically ranging from 12 to 13 such ratio varies across different projects due to various system design factors projects are typically removed from our advancedstage project pipeline tables below once we substantially complete construction of the project and after substantially all of the associated project revenue is recognized projects or portions of projects may also be removed from the tables below in the event an epccontracted or partnerdeveloped project does not obtain permitting or financing a project is not able to be sold due to the changing economics of the project or other factors or we decide to temporarily own and operate or retain interests in such projects based on strategic opportunities or market factors

results of operations 

the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  



segment overview 

we operate our business in two segments our modules segment involves the design manufacture and sale of cdte solar modules to third parties and our systems segment includes the development construction operation maintenance and sale of pv solar power systems including any modules installed in such systems and any revenue from energy generated by such systems see note 22   “segment and geographical information ”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for more information on our operating segments see also item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – systems project pipeline” for a description of the system projects in our advancedstage project pipeline 

beginning with the three months ended december 31 2017 we changed the composition of our reportable segments to align with revisions to our internal reporting structure and longterm strategic plans as a result of this change our modules segment which was historically referred to as our components segment includes module sales to third parties and excludes any module sales to our systems segment previously we included an allocation of net sales value for all solar modules manufactured by our modules segment and installed in projects sold or built by our systems segment in the net sales of our modules segment our systems segment now includes all net sales from the sale of solar power systems and related products and services including any modules installed in such systems and any revenue from energy generated by such systems all prior year balances were revised to conform to the current year presentation 

 56 

net sales 

modules business 

we generally price and sell our solar modules per watt of nameplate power during 2017  zorlu enerji  and rcr o’donnell griffin pty ltd  each accounted for more than 10  of our modules business net sales and the majority of our solar modules were sold to integrators and operators of systems in the united states india and turkey substantially all of our modules business net sales during 2017  were denominated in us dollars we recognize revenue for module sales at a point in time following the transfer of control of such products to the customer which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery depending on the terms of the underlying contracts the revenue recognition policies for module sales are further described in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

systems business 

through our fully integrated systems business we provide complete turnkey pv solar power systems or solar solutions that draw upon our capabilities which include i project development ii epc services and iii om services additionally within our systems segment we may temporarily own and operate certain of our systems for a period of time based on strategic opportunities or market factors we typically recognize revenue for sales of solar power systems using cost based input methods which result in revenue being recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred compared to the total estimated costs for a given contract we may also recognize revenue for the sale of a system after the project has been completed due to the timing of when we enter into the associated sales contract with the customer the revenue recognition policies for our systems business are further described in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

during 2017  the majority of our systems business net sales were in north america and the principal customer of our systems business was capital dynamics  which accounted for more than 10 of our systems business net sales 

the following table shows net sales by reportable segment for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  



net sales  from our modules segment increased  by 1309 million  in 2017  primarily due to a 68  increase in the volume of watts sold partially offset by a 29  decrease in the average selling price per watt net sales from our systems segment decreased  by 942 million  in 2017  primarily as a result of the completion of substantially all construction activities on a number of projects in 2016  including the desert stateline astoria taylor east pecos silver state south butler and mccoy projects partially offset by the sale of the moapa california flats switch station and cuyama projects in 2017  

net sales  from our modules segment increased  by 4480 million  in 2016  primarily due to a 211  increase in the volume of watts sold partially offset by a 5  decrease in the average selling price per watt net sales from our systems segment decreased  by 17 billion  in 2016  primarily from the sale of majority interests in the desert stateline north star and lost hills projects in 2015  the completion of substantially all construction activities on the imperial solar energy center west and decatur projects in 2015  the completion of substantially all construction activities on the silver state south and mccoy projects in the first half of 2016  and lower module plus sales transactions this decrease in revenue was partially offset by higher revenue from the commencement of construction on the taylor and butler projects in late 2015  the commencement of construction on the east pecos project in early 2016  and completion of substantially all construction activities on the astoria project 

 57 

cost of sales 

modules business 

our modules business cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials and components for manufacturing solar modules such as glass transparent conductive coatings cdte and other thin film semiconductors laminate materials connector assemblies and edge seal materials in addition our cost of sales includes direct labor for the manufacturing of solar modules and manufacturing overhead such as engineering equipment maintenance environmental health and safety quality and production control information technology and procurement costs our cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing plant and equipment facilityrelated expenses and costs associated with shipping warranties and solar module collection and recycling excluding accretion 

systems business 

for our systems business projectrelated costs include development costs legal consulting transmission upgrade interconnection permitting and other similar costs epc costs consisting primarily of solar modules inverters electrical and mounting hardware project management and engineering costs and construction labor costs and site specific costs 

the following table shows cost of sales by reportable segment for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  



cost of sales   increased   1262 million  or 6  and increased   33 percentage points  as a percent of net sales when comparing 2017  with 2016  the increase  in cost of sales was driven by a 1291 million   increase  in our modules segment cost of sales primarily due to higher costs of 3662 million  from the increased volume of modules sold directly to third parties partially offset by continued cost reductions in the cost per watt of our solar modules which decreased cost of sales by 1824 million  a reduction in our product warranty liability of 313 million  due to lower estimated module replacement costs a reduction in our module collection and recycling liability of 135 million  from updates to several valuation assumptions including a decrease in certain inflation rates and lower inventory writedowns of 92 million  

cost of sales   decreased   7137 million  or 24  and increased   55 percentage points  as a percentage of net sales when comparing 2016  with 2015  the decrease  in cost of sales was primarily the result of a 11 billion   decrease  in our systems segment cost of sales primarily due to the volume of projects under construction and the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria were met this net decrease was partially offset by a 3894 million  increase in our modules segment cost of sales primarily due to higher costs of 5108 million  associated with the increased volume of modules sold directly to third parties a reduction in our module collection and recycling liability of 696 million  in 2015 resulting from certain recycling technology advancements which significantly increased the throughput of modules able to be recycled at a point in time along with other material and labor cost reductions and higher inventory writedowns of 223 million  primarily related to our remaining crystalline silicon module inventories partially offset by continued cost reductions in the cost per watt of our solar modules which decreased our cost of sales by 2173 million  

 58 

gross profit 

gross profit  may be affected by numerous factors including the selling prices of our modules and systems our manufacturing costs project development costs bos costs the capacity utilization of our manufacturing facilities and foreign exchange rates gross profit  may also be affected by the mix of net sales from our modules and systems businesses 

the following table shows gross profit for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  



gross profit   decreased   33 percentage points  to 187  during 2017  from 220  during 2016  primarily due to a mix of lower gross profit projects sold and under construction during the period and reductions in the average selling price per watt of our modules sold directly to third parties partially offset by the reductions in our product warranty liability and our module collection and recycling liability as described above 

gross profit   decreased   55 percentage points to 220  during 2016  from 275  during 2015  primarily as a result of a mix of lower gross profit projects sold and under construction the reduction in our module collection and recycling liability in 2015 as described above and higher inventory writedowns partially offset by continued cost reductions in the cost per watt of our solar modules 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative  expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated costs professional fees insurance costs travel expenses and other business development and selling expenses 

the following table shows selling general and administrative expense for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  



selling general and administrative  expense in 2017   decreased  compared to 2016  primarily due to higher impairments of certain project assets in 2016  lower employee compensation expense due to various restructuring activities lower professional fees lower infrastructure related expenses and lower business development expenses selling general and administrative  expense in 2016   increased  compared to 2015  primarily from higher development costs for earlystage projects and impairments of certain project assets partially offset by lower employee compensation expense due to various restructuring activities and lower professional fees associated with the formation and ipo of the partnership 

research and development 

research and development  expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated costs the cost of products materials and outside services used in our process and product rd activities and depreciation and amortization expense associated with rd specific facilities and equipment we maintain a number of programs and activities to improve our technology and processes in order to enhance the performance and reduce the costs of our solar modules and systems 

 59 

the following table shows research and development expense for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  



research and development  expense in 2017   decreased  compared to 2016  primarily due to lower costs for thirdparty contracted services reduced material and module testing costs the termination of certain rd programs for legacy module technologies and lower employee compensation expense resulting from reductions to our rd headcount as part of various restructuring activities during 2017  the average conversion efficiency of our cdte solar modules produced was 169  compared to 164  in 2016  research and development  expense in 2016   decreased  compared to 2015  primarily due to reductions in our rd headcount and employee compensation expense resulting from various restructuring activities during 2016  the average conversion efficiency of our cdte solar modules was 164  compared to 156  in 2015  

production startup 

production startup  expense consists primarily of employee compensation and other costs associated with operating a production line before it has been qualified for full production including the cost of raw materials for solar modules run through the production line during the qualification phase and applicable facility related costs costs related to equipment upgrades and implementation of manufacturing process improvements are also included in production startup expense as well as costs related to the selection of a new site related legal and regulatory costs and costs to maintain our plant replication program to the extent we cannot capitalize these expenditures in general we expect production startup expense per production line to be higher when we build an entirely new manufacturing facility compared with the addition or replacement of production lines at an existing manufacturing facility primarily due to the additional infrastructure investment required when building an entirely new facility 

the following table shows production startup expense for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  



during 2017  and 2016  we primarily incurred production startup expense for the transition to series 6 module manufacturing at our facilities in perrysburg ohio and kulim malaysia production startup  expense for 2015  was primarily driven by our previous crystalline silicon module manufacturing operations which we ended in 2016  as further described in note 4 “restructuring and asset impairments”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

restructuring and asset impairments 

restructuring and asset impairments   consists of expenses incurred related to material restructuring initiatives and includes any associated asset impairments costs for employee termination benefits costs for contract terminations and penalties and other restructuring related costs such restructuring initiatives are intended to align the organization with then current business conditions and to reduce costs 

 60 

the following table shows restructuring and asset impairments for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  



in november 2016 our board of directors approved a set of initiatives to accelerate our transition to series 6 module manufacturing and restructure our operations in june 2016 we ended production of our crystalline silicon modules to focus on our core cdte module and utilityscale systems as a result of these decisions we recorded restructuring and asset impairment charges of 418 million  and 7439 million  during 2017  and 2016  respectively in 2017 we also reversed a customs tax liability associated with a prior restructuring activity which reduced our restructuring charges by 47 million  during the period see note 4 “restructuring and asset impairments”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information on these matters 

goodwill impairment 

the following table shows goodwill impairments for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  



as a result of our annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of 2016 we impaired the remaining 688 million  of goodwill of our systems reporting unit primarily due to a strategic shift in the mix of our module and system net sales which was approved by our board of directors in november 2016 as part of the restructuring activities described above this shift involved an expected reduction in the annual megawatts sold through systems business projects other factors that contributed to the impairment included our reduced market capitalization and the challenging conditions within the solar industry as of the date of our testing in june 2016 we also impaired the remaining 61 million  of goodwill associated with our crystalline silicon modules reporting unit due to the decision to end the related manufacturing operations as described above see note 6 “goodwill and intangible assets”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

foreign currency loss net 

foreign currency loss net  consists of the net effect of gains and losses resulting from holding assets and liabilities and conducting transactions denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries’ functional currencies 

the following table shows foreign currency loss net for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  



foreign currency loss net   decreased  in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily as a result of lower costs associated with hedging activities related to our subsidiaries in india the weakening of the us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies and differences between our economic hedge positions and the underlying exposures foreign currency loss net   increased  in 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to higher costs for hedging activities related to our subsidiaries in india differences between our economic hedge positions and the underlying exposures and changes in certain foreign currency rates 

 61 

interest income 

interest income  is earned on our cash cash equivalents marketable securities and restricted cash and investments interest income also includes interest earned from notes receivable and late customer payments 

the following table shows interest income for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  



interest income during 2017   increased  compared to 2016  primarily due to higher cash balances during the period higher interest rates associated with such cash balances and a promissory note with an affiliate issued in late 2016  interest income during 2016   increased  compared to 2015  primarily due to higher interest rates on our marketable securities 

interest expense net 

interest expense is primarily comprised of interest incurred on longterm debt settlements of interest rate swap contracts and changes in the fair value of interest rate swap contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting in accordance with asc 815 we capitalize interest expense into our project assets or property plant and equipment when such costs qualify for interest capitalization which reduces the amount of net interest expense reported in any given period 

the following table shows interest expense net for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  



interest expense net increased  in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to changes in the fair value of interest rate swap contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting and higher levels of project specific debt financings partially offset by lower interest expense associated with certain malaysian credit facilities that were fully repaid in 2016  interest expense net increased  in 2016  compared to 2015  primarily as a result of lower interest costs capitalized to certain projects that were substantially completed in 2016  and higher levels of project specific debt financings outstanding during the period 

other income expense net 

other income expense net  is primarily comprised of miscellaneous items and realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities and cost method investments 

the following table shows other income expense net for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  



other income expense net   decreased  in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to realized gains of 413 million  in 2016  from the sale of certain restricted investments driven by an effort to align the currencies of the investments with those of the corresponding collection and recycling liabilities and a 74 million  reversal of the outstanding contingent consideration associated with our tetrasun acquisition as the result of our crystalline silicon module manufacturing restructuring in 2016  partially offset by an incremental settlement in 2017  for the resolution of an outstanding matter with a former customer the increase  in other income expense net in 2016  compared to 2015  was primarily attributable to the transactions described above partially offset by the impairment of a cost method investment in 2016  

 62 

income tax expense 

in december 2017 the us president signed into law the tax act which significantly revised us tax law by among other things lowering the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 eliminating certain deductions imposing a mandatory onetime transition tax on certain accumulated earnings and profits of foreign corporate subsidiaries the “transition tax” that may electively be paid over eight years introducing new tax regimes and changing how foreign earnings are subject to us tax the tax act also includes many new provisions such as changes to bonus depreciation changes to deductions for executive compensation net operating loss deduction limitations a tax on global intangible lowtaxed income “gilti” earned by foreign corporate subsidiaries a base erosion antiabuse tax “beat” and a deduction for foreignderived intangible income “fdii” many of these provisions including the tax on gilti the beat and the deduction for fdii are not applicable to us until 2018 and we continue to evaluate the impact of such provisions of the tax act 

during the year ended december 31 2017  we recognized an aggregate provisional tax expense of 4081 million  which included an amount for the transition tax of 4015 million  and a net deferred tax expense of 66 million  for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities taking into account the lower us corporate income tax rate of 21  the final effects of the tax act may differ from these provisional amounts possibly materially due to among other things changes in interpretations of the tax act any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the tax act any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the tax act any updates or changes to estimates utilized to calculate provisional amounts or actions we may take as a result of the tax act the associated accounting for the tax act is expected to be completed when our 2017 us corporate income tax return is filed in 2018 

income tax expense or benefit deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect our best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which we operate principally australia india and malaysia significant judgments and estimates are required in determining our consolidated income tax expense the statutory federal corporate income tax rate in the us will decrease from 35  to 21  beginning in january 2018 while the tax rates in australia india and malaysia are 30  346  and 24  respectively in malaysia we have been granted a longterm tax holiday scheduled to expire in 2027  pursuant to which substantially all of our income earned in malaysia is exempt from income tax 

the following table shows income tax expense for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  



our tax rate is affected by recurring items such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions the rate is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from period to period income tax expense   increased  by 3488 million  during 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to provisional tax expense of 4081 million  related to the tax act as described above higher pretax income a 354 million  reversal of an uncertain tax position in 2016 related to the income of a foreign subsidiary and lower excess tax benefits associated with sharebased compensation partially offset by certain us taxes in 2016 on a cash distribution received from a foreign subsidiary and a 421 million  discrete tax benefit associated with the acceptance of our election to classify certain of our german subsidiaries as disregarded entities of first solar inc 

income tax expense decreased  by 92 million  during 2016  compared to 2015  primarily as a result of lower pretax income and the 354 million  reversal of an uncertain tax position as described above partially offset by certain us taxes on a cash distribution received from a foreign subsidiary and a 417 million discrete tax benefit associated with the receipt of a private letter ruling during 2015 see note 19 “income taxes”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information

equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates net of tax 

equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates net of tax   represents our proportionate share of the earnings or losses of unconsolidated affiliates with whom we have made equity method investments as well as any gains or losses on the sale or disposal of such investments 

the following table shows equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates net of tax for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  



equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates net of tax   decreased  in 2017  compared to 2016  primarily due to the recognition of a gain of 1251 million  net of tax in december 2016  from the sale of our residual interest in the desert stateline project to 8point3 operating company llc “opco” a subsidiary of the partnership and lower equity in earnings from our investment in opco equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates net of tax   increased  in 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to the gain on the sale of the desert stateline project in 2016  described above the deferral of certain profit on the sale of our controlling interest in the desert stateline project in 2015  and higher equity in earnings from our investment in opco during the period 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2017  we believe that our cash cash equivalents marketable securities cash flows from operating activities advancedstage project pipeline availability under our senior secured revolving credit facility considering minimum liquidity covenant requirements and access to the capital markets will be sufficient to meet our working capital systems project investment and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months we monitor our working capital to ensure we have adequate liquidity both domestically and internationally 

we intend to maintain appropriate debt levels based upon cash flow expectations our overall cost of capital and expected cash requirements for operations capital expenditures and strategic discretionary spending in the future we may also engage in additional debt or equity financings including project specific debt financings we believe that when necessary we will have adequate access to the capital markets although our ability to raise capital on terms commercially acceptable to us could be constrained if there is insufficient lender or investor interest due to industrywide or companyspecific concerns such financings could result in increased debt service expenses dilution to our existing stockholders or restrictive covenants which require us to maintain certain financial conditions 

as of december 31 2017  we had 30 billion  in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities compared to 20 billion  as of december 31 2016  cash cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december 31 2017  increased primarily from the sale of the moapa california flats switch station and cuyama projects and proceeds from borrowings under project specific debt financings partially offset by purchases of property plant and equipment as of december 31 2017  16 billion  of our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries and was primarily based in us dollar euro and japanese yen denominated holdings as of december 31 2016  12 billion  of our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries and was primarily based in us dollar euro and malaysian ringgit denominated holdings 

we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed if certain international funds were needed for our operations in the us we may be required to accrue and pay certain us and foreign taxes to repatriate such funds although we maintain the intent and ability to permanently reinvest our accumulated earnings outside of the us with the exception of our subsidiaries in canada and germany we continue to evaluate how the tax act may affect our plans to repatriate additional amounts 

 64 

to fund our domestic operations or otherwise deploy our worldwide cash in addition changes to foreign government banking regulations may restrict our ability to move funds among various jurisdictions under certain circumstances which could negatively impact our access to capital resulting in an adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources 

our systems business requires significant liquidity and is expected to continue to have significant liquidity requirements in the future the net amount of our project assets and related portion of deferred revenue which approximates our net capital investment in the development and construction of systems projects was 05 billion  as of december 31 2017  solar power project development and construction cycles which span the time between the identification of a site location and the commercial operation of a system vary substantially and can take many years to mature as a result of these long project cycles and strategic decisions to finance the construction of certain projects using our working capital we may need to make significant upfront investments of resources in advance of the receipt of any cash from the sale of such projects delays in construction progress or in completing the sale of our systems projects that we are selffinancing may also impact our liquidity we have historically financed these upfront systems project investments primarily using working capital in certain circumstances we may need to finance construction costs exclusively using working capital if project financing becomes unavailable due to marketwide regional or other concerns 

from time to time we develop projects in certain markets around the world where we may hold all or a significant portion of the equity in a project for several years given the duration of these investments and the currency risk relative to the us dollar in some of these markets we continue to explore local financing alternatives should these financing alternatives be unavailable or too cost prohibitive we could be exposed to significant currency risk and our liquidity could be adversely impacted 

additionally we may elect to retain an ownership interest in certain systems projects after they become operational if we determine it would be of economic and strategic benefit to do so if for example we cannot sell a systems project at economics that are attractive to us or potential customers are unwilling to assume the risks and rewards typical of pv solar power system ownership we may instead elect to temporarily own and operate such systems until we can sell the systems on economically attractive terms the decision to retain ownership of a system impacts liquidity depending upon the size and cost of the project as of december 31 2017  we had 04 billion  of net pv solar power systems that had been placed in service primarily in international markets we have elected and may in the future elect to enter into temporary or longterm project financing to reduce the impact on our liquidity and working capital with regards to such projects and systems we may also consider entering into tax equity or other arrangements with respect to ownership interests in certain of our projects which could cause a portion of the economics of such projects to be realized over time 

the following additional considerations have impacted or may impact our liquidity in 2018  and beyond 

 



 65 

project they are classified as either project assets pv solar power systems or cost of sales depending on whether the project is subject to a definitive sales contract and whether other revenue recognition criteria have been met we also produce significant volumes of modules for sale directly to thirdparties which requires us to carry inventories at levels sufficient to satisfy the demand of our customers and the needs of their utilityscale projects which may also temporarily reduce our liquidity 

 

 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes key cash flow activity for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  in thousands 



operating activities 

the increase in net cash provided by operating activities during 2017  was primarily driven by the sale of the moapa california flats switch station and cuyama projects partially offset by expenditures for the construction of certain projects the increase in net cash provided by operating activities during 2016  was primarily due to the lower volume of solar power projects under development and construction which generally require significant liquidity when such projects are financed using working capital the increase in net cash provided by operating activities during 2016  was also driven by the sale of certain other solar power projects at or near substantial completion 

investing activities 

the increase in net cash used in investing activities during 2017  was primarily due to i proceeds from sales of equity and cost method investments of 2915 million  in 2016  including the sale of our remaining interest in the desert stateline project ii an increase in purchases of property plant and equipment driven by our transition to series 6 module manufacturing and iii net purchases of marketable securities and restricted investments of 1147 million  in 2017  compared to net proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities and restricted investments of 1029 million  in 2016  the increase in net cash provided by investing activities during 2016  was primarily due to i proceeds from sales of equity and cost method investments described above and ii higher net proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities and restricted investments also described above compared to net purchases of marketable 

 66 

securities and restricted investments of 2031 million  in 2015 partially offset by the receipt of 2390 million  from the ipo of the partnership in 2015 

financing activities 

the increase in net cash provided by financing activities during 2017  was primarily the result of net proceeds from borrowings under longterm debt arrangements associated with the construction of certain projects in japan india and australia of 1913 million  in 2017  compared to net repayments on such debt arrangements of 1106 million  in 2016  and proceeds from commercial letters of credit for the construction of certain projects in india of 430 million  cash used in financing activities during 2016  was primarily driven by the net repayments of longterm debt arrangements described above compared to net proceeds from borrowings under such debt arrangements of 989 million  in 2015 

contractual obligations

we have excluded 842 million  of unrecognized tax benefits from the amounts presented above as the timing of such obligations is uncertain 

 67 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2017  we had no offbalance sheet debt or similar obligations other than financial assurance related instruments and operating leases which are not classified as debt we do not guarantee any thirdparty debt see note 15 “commitments and contingencies”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further information about our financial assurance related instruments 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 3 “recent accounting pronouncements”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for a summary of recent accounting pronouncements 

critical accounting estimates 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of reported assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment in the selection of the appropriate assumptions for making these estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty we base our judgments and estimates on our historical experience our forecasts and other available information as appropriate the actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results our future results of operations will be affected our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k the accounting policies that require the most significant judgment and estimates include the following 

revenue recognition – solar power system sales andor engineering procurement and construction services  we generally recognize revenue for sales of solar power systems andor epc services over time as our performance creates or enhances an energy generation asset controlled by the customer furthermore the sale of a solar power system when combined with epc services represents a single performance obligation for the development and construction of a single generation asset for such sales arrangements we recognize revenue using cost based input methods which recognize revenue and gross profit as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred compared to the total estimated costs of the contract  for sales of solar power systems in which we obtain an interest in the project sold to the customer we recognize all of the revenue for the consideration received including the fair value of the noncontrolling interest we obtained we may also recognize revenue for the sale of a solar power system after it has been completed due to the timing of when we enter into the associated sales contract with the customer 

estimating the fair value of the noncontrolling interest we obtain begins with the valuation of the entire solar project ie solar power system being sold to the customer such valuation generally uses an income based valuation technique in which relevant cash flows are discounted to estimate the expected economic earnings capacity of the project typical factors considered in a project’s valuation include expected energy generation the duration and pricing of the ppa the pricing of energy to be sold on an open contract basis following the termination of the ppa ie merchant pricing curves other offtake agreements the useful life of the system tax attributes such as accelerated depreciation and tax credits sales of renewable energy certificates interconnection rights operating agreements and the cost of capital once the overall project valuation is agreed upon with the customer we determine the relative value related to our specific ownership interests conveyed through the transaction agreements including the membership interest purchase and sale agreement and the limited liability company agreement or equivalent of the project or its holding company 

in applying cost based input methods of revenue recognition we use the actual costs incurred relative to the total estimated costs including solar module costs to determine our progress towards contract completion and to calculate the corresponding amount of revenue and gross profit to recognize cost based input methods of revenue recognition are considered a faithful depiction of our efforts to satisfy longterm construction contracts and therefore reflect the 

 68 

transfer of goods to a customer under such contracts costs incurred that do not contribute to satisfying our performance obligations “inefficient costs” are excluded from our input methods of revenue recognition as the amounts are not reflective of our transferring control of the system to the customer costs incurred towards contract completion may include costs associated with solar modules direct materials labor subcontractors and other indirect costs related to contract performance we recognize solar module and direct material costs as incurred when such items have been installed in a system cost based input methods of revenue recognition require us to make estimates of net contract revenues and costs to complete our projects in making such estimates significant judgment is required to evaluate assumptions related to the amount of net contract revenues including the impact of any performance incentives liquidated damages and other payments to customers significant judgment is also required to evaluate assumptions related to the costs to complete our projects including materials labor contingencies and other system costs 

if the estimated total costs on any contract including any inefficient costs are greater than the net contract revenues we recognize the entire estimated loss in the period the loss becomes known the cumulative effect of revisions to estimates related to net contract revenues or costs to complete contracts are recorded in the period in which the revisions to estimates are identified and the amounts can be reasonably estimated the effect of the changes on future periods are recognized as if the revised estimates had been used since revenue was initially recognized under the contract such revisions could occur in any reporting period and the effects may be material depending on the size of the contracts or the changes in estimates 

as part of our solar power system sales we conduct performance testing of a system prior to substantial completion to confirm the system meets its operational and capacity expectations noted in the epc agreement in addition we may provide an energy performance test during the first or second year of a system’s operation to demonstrate that the actual energy generation for the applicable year meets or exceeds the modeled energy expectation after certain adjustments these tests are based on meteorological energy and equipment performance data measured at the system’s location as well as certain projections of such data over the remaining measurement period in certain instances a bonus payment may be received at the end of the applicable test period if the system performs above a specified level conversely if there is an underperformance event with regards to these tests we may incur liquidated damages as a percentage of the epc contract price such performance guarantees represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional performance data becomes available and only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of any incremental revenue will not occur 

revenue recognition – operations and maintenance we recognize revenue for standard recurring om services over time as customers receive and consume the benefits of such services costs of om services are expensed in the period in which they are incurred as part of our om service offerings we typically offer an effective availability guarantee which stipulates that a system will be available to generate a certain percentage of total possible energy during a specific period after adjusting for factors outside of our control as the service provider these tests are based on meteorological energy and equipment performance data measured at the system’s location as well as certain projections of such data over the remaining measurement period if system availability exceeds a contractual threshold we may receive a bonus payment or if system availability falls below a separate threshold we may incur liquidated damages for certain lost energy under the ppa such bonuses or liquidated damages represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated and recognized over time as customers receive and consume the benefits of the om services 

accrued solar module collection and recycling liability we recognize expense at the time of sale for the estimated cost of our obligations to collect and recycle solar modules covered by our solar module collection and recycling program we estimate the cost of our collection and recycling obligations based on the present value of the expected probabilityweighted future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules which includes estimates for the cost of packaging materials the cost of freight from the solar module installation sites to a recycling center the material labor capital costs the scale of recycling centers and an estimated thirdparty profit margin and return on risk for collection and recycling services we base these estimates on i our experience collecting and recycling our solar modules ii the expected timing of when our solar modules will be returned for recycling and iii the expected 

 69 

economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled in the periods between the time of sale and the related settlement of the collection and recycling obligation we accrete the carrying amount of the associated liability by applying the discount rate used for its initial measurement we periodically review our estimates of expected future recycling costs and may adjust our liability accordingly 

as of december 31 2017  our estimated liability for collecting and recycling solar modules covered by our collection and recycling program was 1666 million  a 1 increase in the annualized inflation rate used in our estimated future collection and recycling cost per module would increase our liability by 335 million  and a 1 decrease in that rate would decrease our liability by 281 million  

product warranties we provide a limited pv solar module warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for approximately 10  years we also typically warrant that modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 98  of their labeled power output rating during the first year with the warranty coverage reducing by 05  every year thereafter throughout the approximate 25 year performance warranty period 

as an alternative form of our standard limited module power output warranty we also offer an aggregated or systemlevel limited module performance warranty this systemlevel limited module performance warranty is designed for utilityscale systems and provides 25 year systemlevel energy degradation protection this warranty represents a practical expedient to address the challenge of identifying from the potential millions of modules installed in a utilityscale system individual modules that may be performing below warranty thresholds by focusing on the aggregate energy generated by the system rather than the power output of individual modules the systemlevel limited module performance warranty is typically calculated as a percentage of a system’s expected energy production adjusted for certain actual site conditions with the warranted level of performance declining each year in a linear fashion but never falling below 80  during the term of the warranty 

in addition to our limited solar module warranties described above for pv solar power systems we construct we typically provide limited warranties for defects in engineering design installation and bos part workmanship for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a system or a block within the system 

when we recognize revenue for module or system sales we accrue liabilities for the estimated future costs of meeting our limited warranty obligations we make and revise these estimates based primarily on the number of our solar modules under warranty installed at customer locations our historical experience with warranty claims our monitoring of field installation sites our internal testing of and the expected future performance of our solar modules and bos parts and our estimated permodule replacement costs as a result of such factors we estimate our limited product warranties based on warranty return rates of approximately 1  to 3  for modules covered under warranty depending on the series of module technology 

as of december 31 2017  our accrued liabilities for product warranties were 2243 million  a 1  change in estimated warranty return rates would change our module warranty liability by 710 million  and a 1  change in the estimated warranty return rate for bos parts would not have a material impact on the associated warranty liability 

income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the united states its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations such tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities we make judgments and interpretations regarding the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining our provision for income taxes and also make estimates about when in the future certain items are expected to affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions disputes over interpretations of tax laws may be settled with the relevant taxing authority upon examination or audit we regularly evaluate the likelihood of assessments in each of our taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and future examinations and we record tax liabilities as appropriate 

 70 

we establish liabilities for potential additional taxes based on our assessment of the outcome of our tax positions once established we adjust these liabilities when additional information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring an adjustment significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the actual cost of a tax assessment fine or penalty may ultimately be materially different from our recorded liabilities if any 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements we calculate our income tax provision based on our interpretation of the tax laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business this requires us to estimate our current tax obligations assess uncertain tax positions and assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 

we must also assess the likelihood that each of our deferred tax assets will be realized to the extent we believe that realization of any of our deferred tax assets is not more likely than not we establish a valuation allowance when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a reporting period we generally record a corresponding tax expense conversely to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed which generally reduces our overall income tax expense 

we continually explore initiatives to better align our tax and legal entity structure with the footprint of our nonus operations and recognize the tax impact of these initiatives including changes in the assessment of uncertain tax positions indefinite reinvestment exception assertions and the realizability of deferred tax assets in the period when we believe all necessary internal and external approvals associated with such initiatives have been obtained or when the initiatives are materially complete it is possible that the completion of one or more of these initiatives may occur within the next 12 months 

asset impairments  we assess longlived assets classified as “held and used” including our property plant and equipment project assets pv solar power systems and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances arise including consideration of technological obsolescence that may indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable and these assessments require significant judgment in determining whether such events or changes have occurred relevant considerations may include a significant decrease in the market price of a longlived asset a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset is being used or in its physical condition a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of a longlived asset an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a longlived asset a currentperiod operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of such losses or a projection of future losses associated with the use of a longlived asset or a current expectation that more likely than not a longlived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss longlived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and we must also exercise judgment in assessing such groupings and levels 

when impairment indicators are present we compare undiscounted future cash flows including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value to the asset group’s carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset group to its carrying value fair value is generally determined by considering i internally developed discounted cash flows for the asset group ii thirdparty valuations andor iii information available regarding the current market value for such assets if the fair value of an asset group is determined to be less than its carrying value an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and such projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized 

 71 

goodwill  goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the estimated fair value assigned to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed we do not amortize goodwill but instead are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually we perform impairment tests between scheduled annual tests in the fourth quarter if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill is less than its carrying value 

we may first make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test such qualitative impairment test considers various factors including macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors the overall financial performance of a reporting unit and any other relevant events affecting our company or a reporting unit if we determine through the qualitative assessment that a reporting unit’s fair value is more likely than not greater than its carrying value the quantitative impairment test is not required if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value we perform a quantitative impairment test we may also elect to proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test without considering qualitative factors 

the quantitative impairment test is the comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill our reporting units consist of our cdte module manufacturing or “modules” business and our fully integrated systems business we define the fair value of a reporting unit as the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date we primarily use an income approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units significant judgment is required when estimating the fair value of a reporting unit including the forecasting of future operating results and the selection of discount and expected future growth rates used to determine projected cash flows if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is not impaired and no further analysis is required conversely if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value we record an impairment loss equal to the excess not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency exchange risk 

cash flow exposure  we expect certain of our subsidiaries to have future cash flows that will be denominated in currencies other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies changes in the exchange rates between the functional currencies of our subsidiaries and the other currencies in which they transact will cause fluctuations in the cash flows we expect to receive or pay when these cash flows are realized or settled accordingly we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of these forecasted cash flows these foreign exchange forward contracts qualify for accounting as cash flow hedges in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 815 derivatives and hedging  and we designated them as such we initially report the effective portion of a derivative’s unrealized gain or loss in “ accumulated other comprehensive income loss ” and subsequently reclassify amounts into earnings when the hedged transaction occurs and impacts earnings 

for additional details on our derivative hedging instruments and activities see note 10 “derivative financial instruments”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

certain of our international operations such as our manufacturing facility in malaysia pay a portion of their operating expenses including associate wages and utilities in local currencies which exposes us to foreign currency exchange risk for such expenses our manufacturing facilities are also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk for purchases of certain equipment from international vendors as we expand into new markets worldwide particularly emerging markets our total foreign currency exchange risk in terms of both size and exchange rate volatility and the number of foreign currencies we are exposed to could increase significantly 

 72 

for the year ended december 31 2017  our international customers accounted for 23  of our net sales and 5  of our net sales during the period were denominated in foreign currencies including euros and indian rupees  as a result we have exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to our net sales which has historically represented one of our primary foreign currency exchange risks a 10 change in the us dollar to euro and us dollar to indian rupee exchange rates would have had an aggregate impact on our net sales of 101 million  excluding the effect of our hedging activities 

transaction exposure many of our subsidiaries have assets and liabilities primarily cash receivables marketable securities deferred taxes payables accrued expenses and solar module collection and recycling liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies changes in the exchange rates between the functional currencies of our subsidiaries and the other currencies in which these assets and liabilities are denominated will create fluctuations in our reported consolidated statements of operations and cash flows we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other financial instruments to economically hedge assets and liabilities against the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations the gains and losses on such foreign exchange forward contracts will economically offset all or part of the transaction gains and losses that we recognize in earnings on the related foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 

for additional details on our economic hedging instruments and activities see note 10 “derivative financial instruments”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

for the year ended december 31 2017  a 10 change in the us dollar to japanese yen and us dollar to vietnamese dong exchange rates would have impacted our net foreign currency loss by 26 million  including the effect of our hedging activities other than such exposures we did not have material transaction exposure to other foreign currencies as of december 31 2017  

interest rate risk 

variable rate debt exposure we are exposed to interest rate risk as certain of our project specific debt financings have variable interest rates exposing us to variability in interest expense and cash flows see note 14 “debt”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information on our longterm debt borrowing rates an increase in relevant interest rates would increase the cost of borrowing under certain of our project specific debt financings if such variable interest rates changed by 100 basis points our interest expense for the year ended december 31 2017  would have changed by 07 million  

customer financing exposure  we are also indirectly exposed to interest rate risk because many of our customers depend on debt financings to purchase modules or systems an increase in interest rates could make it challenging for our customers to obtain the capital necessary to make such purchases on favorable terms or at all such factors could lower demand or the price we can charge for our modules and systems thereby reducing our net sales and gross profit in addition we believe that a significant percentage of our customers purchase systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt an increase in interest rates could lower an investor’s return on investment in a system or make alternative investments more attractive relative to pv solar power systems which in either case could cause these endusers to seek alternative investments that promise higher returns 

marketable securities and restricted investments exposure  we invest in various debt securities which exposes us to interest rate risk the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal and provide liquidity while at the same time maximizing the return on our investments many of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk accordingly a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the market value of such investments to fluctuate for example if we hold a security that was issued with an interest rate fixed at the thenprevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate subsequently rises the market value of our investment may decline 

for the year ended december 31 2017  our marketable securities earned a return of 1  including the impact of fluctuations in the price of the underlying securities and had a weightedaverage maturity of 12 months  as of the end 

 73 

of the period based on our investment positions as of december 31 2017  a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would have resulted in a 46 million  change in the market value of our investment portfolio for the year ended december 31 2017  our restricted investments incurred a loss of 3  including the impact of fluctuations in the price of the underlying securities and had a weightedaverage maturity of approximately 17  years as of the end of the period based on our restricted investment positions as of december 31 2017  a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would have resulted in a 628 million  change in the market value of our restricted investment portfolio 

commodity and component risk 

we are exposed to price risks for the raw materials components services and energy costs used in the manufacturing and transportation of our solar modules and bos parts used in our systems also some of our raw materials and components are sourced from a limited number of suppliers or a single supplier we endeavor to qualify multiple suppliers using a robust qualification process in some cases we also enter into longterm supply contracts for raw materials and components as a result we remain exposed to price changes in the raw materials and components used in our solar modules and systems in addition the failure of a key supplier could disrupt our supply chain which could result in higher prices andor a disruption in our manufacturing or construction processes we may be unable to pass along changes in the costs of the raw materials and components for our modules and systems to our customers and may be in default of our delivery obligations if we experience a manufacturing or construction disruption 

credit risk 

we have certain financial and derivative instruments that subject us to credit risk these consist primarily of cash cash equivalents marketable securities trade accounts receivable restricted cash and investments notes receivable and foreign exchange forward contracts we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial and derivative instruments we place cash cash equivalents marketable securities restricted cash and investments and foreign exchange forward contracts with various highquality financial institutions and limit the amount of credit risk from any one counterparty we continuously evaluate the credit standing of our counterparty financial institutions our net sales are primarily concentrated among a limited number of customers we monitor the financial condition of our customers and perform credit evaluations whenever considered necessary depending upon the sales arrangement we may require some form of payment security from our customers including advance payments parent guarantees bank guarantees or commercial letters of credit

market overview 

solar energy is a growing form of renewable energy with numerous economic and environmental benefits that make it an attractive complement to andor substitute for traditional forms of electricity generation in recent years the price of pv solar power systems and accordingly the cost of producing electricity from such systems has dropped to levels that are competitive with or even below the wholesale price of electricity in many markets the rapid price decline that pv solar energy has experienced in recent years opens new possibilities to develop systems in some locations with limited or no financial incentives the fact that a pv solar power system requires no fuel provides a unique and valuable hedging benefit to owners of such systems relative to traditional electricity generation assets once installed pv solar power systems can function for 25 or more years with relatively less maintenance or oversight compared to traditional forms of electricity generation in addition to these economic benefits solar energy has several environmental benefits for example pv solar power systems do not generate any greenhouse gas or other emissions and use no or minimal amounts of water compared to traditional forms of electricity generation worldwide solar markets continue to develop aided by the above factors as well as demand elasticity resulting from declining industry average selling prices both at the module and system level which make solar power more affordable 

the solar industry continues to be characterized by intense pricing competition both at the module and system levels in particular module average selling prices in the united states and several other key markets have experienced an accelerated decline in recent months and module average selling prices are expected to continue to decline to some degree in the short and medium terms according to market forecasts in the aggregate we believe manufacturers of solar modules and cells have significant installed production capacity relative to global demand and the ability for additional capacity expansion we believe the solar industry may from time to time experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity exceeds global demand and that such periods will put downward pressure on pricing we believe the solar industry is currently in such a period additionally intense competition at the system level may result in an environment in which pricing falls rapidly thereby further increasing demand for solar energy solutions but constraining the ability for project developers engineering procurement and construction “epc” companies and verticallyintegrated solar companies such as first solar to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability in light of such market realities we are executing our long term strategic plan as described below under which we are focusing on our competitive strengths such strengths include our advanced module and system technologies as well as our verticallyintegrated business model that enables us to provide utilityscale pv solar energy solutions to key markets with current electricity needs 

strategy and competitive strengths 

to build upon our leading industry position and to remain one of the preferred providers of pv solar energy solutions we are pursuing the following strategies differentiation sustainable growth and financial viability

sustainable growth 

our long term strategic plan is a longterm roadmap to achieve our technology cost leadership and growth objectives in executing our long term strategic plan we are focusing on providing utilityscale pv solar energy solutions using our modules in key geographic markets that we believe have a compelling need for massscale pv electricity including markets throughout the americas the asiapacific region and the middle east as part of our long term strategic plan we are focusing on opportunities in which our pv solar energy solutions can compete directly with fossil fuel offerings on an lcoe or similar basis or complement such fossil fuel electricity offerings execution of the long term strategic plan entails a prioritization of market opportunities worldwide relative to our core strengths and a corresponding allocation of resources around the globe this prioritization involves a focus on our core module and utilityscale offerings and exists within a current market environment that includes rooftop and distributed generation solar particularly in the united states while it is unclear how rooftop and distributed generation solar might impact our core utilityscale offerings in the next several years we believe that utilityscale solar will continue to be a compelling solar offering for companies with technology and cost leadership and will continue to represent an increasing portion of the overall electricity generation mix 

we are closely evaluating and managing the appropriate level of resources required as we pursue the most advantageous and cost effective projects and partnerships in our target markets we have dedicated and intend to continue to dedicate significant capital and human resources to reduce the total installed cost of pv solar energy to optimize the design and logistics around our pv solar energy solutions and to ensure that our solutions integrate well into the overall electricity ecosystem of each specific market we expect that over time an increasing portion of our consolidated net sales operating income and cash flows may come from solar offerings in the key geographic markets described above as we execute on our long term strategic plan the timing execution and financial impacts of our long term strategic plan are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in item 1a “risk factors” we are focusing our resources in those markets and energy applications in which solar power can be a leastcost bestfit energy solution particularly in regions with high solar resources significant current or projected electricity demand andor relatively high existing electricity prices as part of these efforts we continue to optimize resources globally including business development sales personnel and other professional staff supporting target markets 

joint ventures or other strategic arrangements with partners are a key part of our long term strategic plan and we generally use such arrangements to expedite our penetration of various key markets and establish relationships with potential customers we also enter into joint ventures or strategic arrangements with customers or other entities to maximize the value of particular projects some of these arrangements involve and are expected in the future to involve significant investments or other allocations of capital we continue to develop relationships with customers in these strategic markets with a view to creating opportunities for utilityscale pv solar power systems we sell such systems directly to end customers including utilities independent power producers commercial and industrial companies and other system owners depending on the market opportunity our sales offerings may range from moduleonly sales to module sales with a range of development epc services and other solutions to full turnkey pv solar power system sales we expect these offerings to continue to evolve over time as we work with our customers to optimize how our pv solar energy solutions can best meet our customers’ energy and economic needs 

financial viability 

first solar’s commitment is to create longterm shareholder value and generate returns on invested capital in excess of its weighted average cost of capital over that time horizon despite substantial downward pressure on the price of solar modules due to pricing competition and significant capacity in the industry we have continued to deliver strong financial performance and liquidity as planned we expect to continue to drive operating expense efficiencies and improvements while still investing in growth the continued development of our global sales capabilities and our rd roadmap we seek to balance our incentive compensation and decisionmaking processes to ensure we direct our efforts and investments towards longterm profitable and sustainable growth with appropriate returns on invested capital and reinvest excess returns back into the business

global markets 

we have established and are continuing to develop a business presence on six continents as described below energy markets are by their nature localized with different drivers and market forces impacting electricity generation and demand in a particular region or for a particular application accordingly our business is evolving worldwide and is shaped by the varying ways in which our pv solar energy solutions can be a compelling and economically viable solution to energy needs in different markets and applications 

the americas 

 

 

europe the middle east and africa

jordan the uae and saudi arabia are actively facilitating the development of the independent power production sector in their countries for example jordan has committed to installing 10  gw of pv solar capacity by 2020  while the uae has tendered over 10  gw of independent power production owned utilityscale solar in 2016  alone saudi arabia has also solicited 100  mw of utilityscale solar as part of the inaugural solar independent power production tender in what is expected to be a 95  gw renewable energy program across the arabian gulf the region’s stateowned hydrocarbon companies continue to be involved in driving regional solar programs examples include initiatives spearheaded by saudi aramco and the kuwait oil company however as with any emerging market challenges remain including those related to evolving policy and legislation infrastructure the availability of financing the level of competition and geopolitical risk while energy subsidies also remain a challenge declining hydrocarbon revenues have led some regional governments specifically the uae and saudi arabia to move towards reducing government support for conventional fuels thereby paving the way for solar to become even more cost competitive 

  

since establishing a presence in the middle east in 2013  first solar has focused on the region’s utilityscale segment while pursuing a range of opportunities in addition to constructing the 13  mw dc first phase of the mohammed bin rashid al maktoum solar park in dubai first solar also supplied modules for the park’s 200  mw ac second phase in jordan first solar completed construction of the 53  mw ac shams ma’an pv solar power system which accounts for approximately 1  of jordan’s annual energy output as a result of these and other projects first solar has become a leading provider of pv solutions in the middle east with an expected installed capacity of nearly 300  mw ac across the region by the end of 2017  

 

asiapacific “apac” and india 

 

 

in 2016 we completed the construction of six  solar projects and commenced the construction of three  additional projects including the 59  mw ac solar project we acquired the rights to develop in 2015 we are partnering with local companies to develop construct and operate pv solar power systems which will further mitigate japan’s dependence on nuclear power and fossil fuel imports our sales offerings in japan also include our cdte modules and om services 

 8 

 

in 2016  we secured rights through a competitive auction to sell power under a 25 year ppa for a cumulative capacity of 60  mw ac to the state owned electricity distribution companies in karnataka and were in the advanced stages of construction of a 50  mw ac project in telangana in 2015  we successfully achieved commercial operation of 130  mw ac of projects in andhra pradesh and telangana we continue to maintain our strong pv module presence in india with over 1300  mw dc of installed modules 

 

support programs 

although our long term strategic plan provides for first solar to compete in key markets that do not require solarspecific government subsidies or support programs in the near term our net sales and profits remain subject to regulation and variability based on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives support programs for pv solar electricity generation depending on the jurisdiction include fits quotas including renewable portfolio standards and tendering systems and net energy metering programs in addition to these support programs financial incentives for pv solar electricity generation include tax incentives grants loans rebates and production incentives although we expect to become less impacted by and less dependent on support programs as we execute our long term strategic plan support programs will continue to play varying roles in accelerating the adoption of pv solar systems around the world 

in europe renewable energy targets in conjunction with fits renewable obligation certificates and other schemes such as tenders for utilityscale pv solar have contributed to the growth in pv solar markets renewable energy targets prescribe how much energy consumption must come from renewable sources while incentive policies and competitive tender policies are intended to support new supply development by providing certainty to investors a 2009  european union “eu” directive on renewable energy which replaced an earlier 2001  directive sets varying targets for all eu member states in support of the directive’s goal of a 20  share of energy from renewable sources in the eu by 2020  and requires national action plans that establish clear pathways for the development of renewable energy sources a renewal of such directive is currently under discussion in europe 

tax incentive programs exist in the united states at both the federal and state level and can take the form of investment and production tax credits accelerated depreciation and sales and property tax exemptions and abatements at the federal level investment tax credits for business and residential solar systems have gone through several cycles of enactment and expiration since the 1980s in 2015 the us congress extended the 30  federal energy investment tax credit “itc” for both residential and commercial solar installations through 2019 the credit will step down to 26  in 2020 22  in 2021 and remain at 10  permanently beginning in 2022  the itc has been an important economic driver of solar installations in the united states and its extension is expected to contribute to greater mediumterm demand visibility in the united states the positive impact of the itc has depended to a large degree on the availability of tax equity for project financing and any significant reduction in the availability of tax equity in the future could make it more difficult to develop and construct projects requiring financing the eventual stepdown of the itc to 10  underscores the need for the lcoe from solar systems to continue to decline and remain competitive with other sources of energy generation 

 9 

at the federal level the environmental protection agency’s adoption of a final clean power plan rule the “rule” and implementation of the rule through state plans offered the possibility of increasing the demand for pv solar generating capacity in certain regions of the united states in which pv solar has not historically received significant statelevel policy support however the adoption and implementation of the rule has been impacted by litigation against the rule initiated by states and other stakeholders which has not yet been resolved and in february 2016 the us supreme court stayed implementation of the rule while such legal challenges are pending it is therefore premature to assess what the effects of the rule will be on pv solar markets 

the majority of states in the united states have enacted legislation adopting renewable portfolio standard “rps” mechanisms under an rps regulated utilities and other load serving entities are required to procure a specified percentage of their total retail electricity sales to enduser customers from eligible renewable resources such as solar generating facilities by a specified date some programs may further require that a specified portion of the total percentage of renewable energy must come from solar generating facilities or other technologies rps legislation and implementing regulations vary significantly from state to state particularly with respect to the percentage of renewable energy required to achieve the state’s rps the definition of eligible renewable energy resources and the extent to which renewable energy credits certificates representing the generation of renewable energy qualify for rps compliance measured in terms of the volume of renewable electricity required to meet its rps mandate california’s rps program is the most significant in the united states and the california market for renewable energy has dominated the western united states region for the past several years first enacted in 2002  california’s rps statute has been amended several times to increase the overall percentage requirement as well as to accelerate the target date for program compliance pursuant to amendments enacted by the california legislature in 2015  the california rps program now requires utilities and other obligated load serving entities to procure 50  of their total retail electricity demand from eligible renewable resources by 2030  in 2016  approximately 45  of our total net sales were derived from our systems projects or thirdparty module sales to solar power systems in california 

the current us administration’s proposed and contemplated environmental and tax policies may create regulatory uncertainty in the renewable energy sector including the solar energy sector and may lead to a reduction or removal of various clean energy programs and initiatives designed to curtail climate change for more information about the risks associated with these potential government actions see item 1a “risk factors – the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives tax incentives renewable energy targets and other support for ongrid solar electricity applications or other adverse public policies could reduce demand andor price levels for our solar modules and systems and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales thereby adversely impacting our operating results ”

components business 

our components business involves the design manufacture and sale of cdte solar modules which convert sunlight into electricity 

solar modules 

our flagship module since the inception of first solar has been manufactured using our advanced cdte thinfilm technology each series 4 solar module is a glass laminate approximately 2ft x 4ft 60cm x 120cm in size that encapsulates a cdte thinfilm semiconductor our solar modules had an average rated power per module of approximately 114 watts  107 watts  and 95 watts  for 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively our series 4 module which offers up to 10  more energy than conventional crystalline silicon modules with the same efficiency rating in certain geographic markets is compatible with advanced 1500volt plant architectures our series 4a tm  module variant features antireflective coated glass which further enhances energy production our semiconductor structure is a singlejunction polycrystalline thinfilm that uses cdte as the absorption layer cdte has absorption properties that are well matched to the solar spectrum and can deliver competitive conversion efficiencies using approximately 12 of the amount of semiconductor material that is used to manufacture traditional crystalline silicon solar modules one of the drivers of first solar modules’ performance advantage over traditional crystalline silicon modules is a lower temperature coefficient of peak power delivering higher energy yields at elevated operating temperatures typical of utilityscale solar power plants in sunny regions 

we recently announced plans for the introduction of our series 6 solar module which will be over two square meters in active area series 6 modules will be manufactured using the same materials and processes as our legacy module technologies which have been proven in high volume production and have been in the field for over a decade in 2016 we also elected to reallocate our previous crystalline silicon module production capacity to support next generation cdte module offerings as a result we ended production of our crystalline silicon modules to focus on our core cdte module technology 

manufacturing process 

we manufacture our cdte solar modules on highthroughput integrated production lines in an automated proprietary and continuous process our solar modules employ a thin layer of semiconductor material to convert sunlight into electricity our manufacturing process eliminates the multiple supply chain operators and expensive and timeconsuming batch processing steps that are used to produce crystalline silicon solar modules we manufacture solar modules at our perrysburg ohio and kulim malaysia manufacturing facilities as we transition to manufacturing our series 6 module technology we expect to ramp down production of our series 4 related modules over the next two years such temporary reduction in production capacity allows us to use our existing manufacturing infrastructure to more quickly deploy our series 6 module technology to best position us for longterm competitiveness and growth 

we have integrated our cdte manufacturing processes into a continuous production line with the following three stages the deposition stage the cell definition and treatment stage and the assembly and test stage in the deposition stage panels of transparent oxidecoated glass are robotically loaded onto the production line where they are cleaned laser etch identified with a serial number heated and coated with thin layers of cdte and other semiconductor materials using our proprietary vapor transport deposition technology after which the semiconductorcoated plates are cooled rapidly to increase glass strength in the cell definition and treatment stage we use high speed lasers to transform the large single semiconductor coating on the glass plate into a series of interconnected cells that deliver the desired current and voltage output in this stage we also treat the semiconductor film using proprietary chemistries and processes to improve the device performance and we apply a metal sputtered back contact finally in the assembly and test stage we apply busbars interlayer material and a rear glass cover sheet that is laminated to encapsulate the device a junction box and termination wires are then applied to complete the assembly the final assembly stage is the only stage in our production line that requires manual processing 

we maintain a robust quality and reliability assurance program that monitors critical process parameters and measures product performance to ensure that industry and more stringent internal standards are met acceptance testing for electrical leakage visual quality and power measurement on a solar simulator are conducted prior to a module being boxed for shipment the quality and reliability tests complement production surveillance with an ongoing monitoring program subjecting production modules to accelerated life stress testing to help ensure ongoing conformance to requirements of the international electrotechnical commission and underwriters laboratories inc these programs help assure delivery of power and performance in the field with a high level of product quality and reliability 

 11 

research development and engineering 

we continue to devote substantial resources to rd with the primary objective of lowering the lifecycle cost of electricity generated by our pv solar power systems we conduct our rd activities primarily in the united states within our components business we focus our rd activities on among other areas continuing to increase the conversion efficiency and energy yield of our solar modules and continuously improving module durability and manufacturing efficiencies including throughput improvement volume ramp and material cost reduction 

in the course of our rd activities we continuously explore technologies in our efforts to sustain competitive differentiation in our modules we typically qualify process and product improvements for full production at our perrysburg ohio plant and then use a systematic process to propagate them to our other production lines we believe that our systematic approach to technology change management provides continuous improvements and ensures uniform adoption across our production lines in addition our cdte production lines are replicas or near replicas of each other and as a result a process or production improvement on one line can be rapidly and reliably deployed to other production lines 

we regularly produce research cells in our laboratories some of which are tested for performance and certified by independent labs such as the national renewable energy laboratory cell efficiency measures the proportion of light converted in a single solar cell at standard test conditions our research cells are produced using laboratory equipment and methods and are not intended to be representative of our manufacturing capability we believe that our record cells demonstrate a potential longterm module efficiency entitlement of over 19  using our commercialscale manufacturing equipment

customers 

  

with respect to our components business during 2016  we sold the majority of our solar modules not included in our systems projects to integrators and operators of systems in india  the u nited states and the uae  thirdparty module sales represented approximately 23  of our total 2016  net sales additionally we develop design construct and sell pv solar power systems that use the solar modules we manufacture 

during 2016  southern power company  and nextera energy inc  each accounted for more than 10  of our components segment’s net sales which includes the solar modules used in our systems projects we are investing in key geographic markets particularly in areas with abundant solar resources and sizable electricity demand and as part of such efforts we are seeking to develop additional customer relationships which has reduced and is expected to continue to reduce our customer and geographic concentration and dependence

the renewable energy solar energy and solar module sectors are highly competitive and continually evolving as participants in these sectors strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete within the larger electric power industry we face intense competition for sales of solar modules which has resulted in and may continue to result in reduced margins and loss of market share with respect to our components business our primary sources of competition are crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers as well as other thinfilm module manufacturers we believe many crystalline silicon module manufacturers are currently transitioning from multicrystalline wafer technology historically our primary competitor to more efficient monocrystalline wafer technology such transition is being facilitated by the emergence of new and low cost mono wafer suppliers primarily from china coupled with the gradual industry transition to passivated emitter rear contact “perc” cell technology as a result we expect that in the future our primary competition might transition from multicrystalline to monocrystalline perc with higher conversion efficiencies 

 12 

certain of our existing or future competitors may be part of larger corporations that have greater financial resources and greater brand name recognition than we do and as a result may be better positioned to adapt to changes in the industry or the economy as a whole certain competitors may have direct or indirect access to sovereign capital which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time among pv solar module manufacturers the principal methods of competition include sales price per watt conversion efficiency energy yield reliability warranty terms and customer payment terms if competitors reduce module pricing to levels near or below their manufacturing costs or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time our results of operations could be adversely affected at december 31 2016  the global pv industry consisted of more than 50  manufacturers of solar modules in the aggregate these manufacturers have significant installed production capacity relative to global demand and the ability for additional capacity expansion we believe the solar industry may from time to time experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity exceeds global demand and that such periods will put pressure on pricing which could adversely affect our results of operations we believe the solar industry is currently in such a period 

in addition we expect to compete with future entrants into the pv solar industry that offer new technological solutions we also face competition from semiconductor manufacturers and semiconductor equipment manufacturers or their customers that produce pv solar cells solar modules or turnkey production lines we also compete with companies that currently offer or are developing other renewable energy technologies including wind hydropower geothermal biomass and tidal technologies and other power generation sources that employ conventional fossil fuels 

raw materials 

our cdte module manufacturing process uses approximately 30 types of raw materials and components to construct a complete solar module one critical raw material in our production process is cdte of the other raw materials and components the following are also critical to our manufacturing process front glass coated with transparent conductive oxide other semiconductor materials organics such as photo resist tempered back glass packaging components such as interlayer cord platecord plate cap junction box lead wire and solar connectors before we use these materials and components in our manufacturing process a supplier must undergo a rigorous qualification process we continually evaluate new suppliers and currently are qualifying several new suppliers and materials when possible we attempt to use suppliers that can provide a raw material supply source that is near our manufacturing locations reducing the cost and lead times for such materials several of our key raw materials and components are either singlesourced or sourced from a limited number of thirdparty suppliers 

cdte solar module collection and recycling program 

we are committed to extended producer responsibility and take into account the environmental impact of our products over their entire life cycle as part of such efforts we established the solar industry’s first comprehensive module collection and recycling program our module recycling process is designed to enable the recovery of valuable materials including the glass and encapsulated semiconductor material for use in new modules or other products and minimizes the environmental impacts associated with our modules at the end of their useful lives approximately 90 of each collected first solar module can be recycled into materials for reuse for customer sales contracts that include modules covered under this program we agree to pay the costs for the collection and recycling of qualifying solar modules and the endusers agree to notify us disassemble their solar power systems package the solar modules for shipment and revert ownership rights over the modules back to us at the end of the modules’ service lives 

the european union’s waste electronics and electrical equipment “weee” directive places the obligation of recycling including collection treatment and environmentally sound disposal of electrical and electronic equipment products upon producers and such directive is applicable to pv solar modules in eu member states for modules covered under our program that were previously sold into and installed in the eu we continue to maintain a commitment to cover the estimated collection and recycling costs consistent with our historical program in addition as a result of the transposition of the weee directive by the eu member states we have adjusted our offerings as required in various eu member states to ensure compliance with specific eu member state weee regulations 

in addition to achieving substantial environmental benefits our solar module collection and recycling program may provide us the opportunity to recover certain raw materials and components for reuse in our manufacturing process we currently have recycling facilities operating at each of our current manufacturing facilities in the united states and malaysia and at our former manufacturing facility location in germany that produce glass cullet suitable for use in the production of new glass products by a thirdparty supplier and unrefined semiconductor materials that are further processed by a thirdparty supplier and then used to produce semiconductor materials for use in new solar modules 

 13 

solar module warranties 

we provide a limited pv solar module warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for generally 10  years we also typically warrant that modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 97  of their labeled power output rating during the first year with the warranty coverage reducing by 07  every year thereafter throughout the 25 year performance warranty period in resolving claims under both the limited defect and power output warranties we typically have the option of either repairing or replacing the covered modules or under the limited power output warranty providing additional modules to remedy the power shortfall we also have the option to make a payment for the thencurrent market price of modules to resolve the claims such limited module warranties are standard for module sales and may be transferred from the original purchasers of the solar modules to subsequent purchasers upon resale 

as an alternative form of our standard limited module power output warranty we also offer an aggregated or systemlevel limited module performance warranty this systemlevel limited module performance warranty is designed for utilityscale systems and provides 25 year systemlevel energy degradation protection in addition this warranty represents a practical expedient to address the challenge of identifying from the potential millions of modules installed in a utilityscale system individual modules that may be performing below warranty thresholds by focusing on the aggregate energy generated by the system rather than the power output of individual modules the systemlevel limited module performance warranty typically is calculated as a percentage of a system’s expected energy production adjusted for certain actual site conditions with the warranted level of performance declining each year in a linear fashion but never falling below 80  during the term of the warranty in resolving claims under the systemlevel limited module performance warranty to restore the system to warranted performance levels we first must validate that the root cause of the issue is due to module performance we then have the option of either repairing or replacing the covered modules providing supplemental modules or making a cash payment consistent with our limited module power output warranty when we elect to satisfy a warranty claim by providing replacement or supplemental modules under the systemlevel module performance warranty we do not have any obligation to pay for the labor to remove or install modules 

in december 2016 we introduced an update to the limited module warranties to be offered on future sales of our pv solar modules under the update to the limited module power output warranty we will warrant that modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 98 of their labeled power output rating during the first year with the warranty coverage reducing by 05 every year thereafter throughout the 25 year performance warranty period our limited module warranties will also include an option for us to remedy claims under such warranties generally exercisable only after the second year of the warranty period by making certain cash payments under the update to the limited workmanship warranty the optional cash payment will be equal to the original purchase price of the module reduced by a degradation factor and under the update to the limited power output warranty the cash payment will be equal to the shortfall in power output 

systems business 

through our fully integrated systems business we provide complete turnkey pv solar power systems or solar solutions which may include project development epc services andor om services 

project development 

project development activities include site selection and securing rights to acquire or use the site obtaining the requisite interconnection and transmission studies executing an interconnection agreement obtaining environmental and landuse permits maintaining effective site control and entering into a ppa with an offtaker of the power to be generated by the project these activities culminate in receiving the right to construct and operate a pv solar power system depending on the market opportunity or geographic location we may acquire projects in various stages of development or acquire project companies from developers in order to complete the development process construct a system incorporating our modules and sell the system to a longterm owner we may also collaborate with local partners in connection with these project development activities depending on the type of project or geographic location ppas or fit structures define the price and terms the utility customer or investor will pay for power produced from the project entering into a ppa generally provides the underlying economics needed to finalize development including permitting beginning construction arranging financing and marketing the project for sale to a longterm owner depending primarily on the location stage of development upon our acquisition of the project and other site attributes the development cycle typically ranges from one to two years but can be as long as five years we may be required to incur significant costs for preliminary engineering permitting legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built if there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals we may be forced to incur additional costs writedown capitalized project assets and the right of the offtaker under the ppa to terminate may be triggered

epc services 

epc services include engineering design and related services bos procurement advanced development of grid integration solutions and construction contracting and management we provide the majority of our epc services to our selfdeveloped projects intended to be sold however we also provide epc services to other system owners such as utilities independent power producers and commercial and industrial companies depending on the customer and market need we may provide our full epc services or any combination of individual products and services within our epc capabilities 

for pv solar power systems built by us we typically provide a limited product warranty on bos parts for defects in engineering design installation and workmanship for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a system in resolving claims under such bos warranties we have the option of remedying the defect through repair or replacement 

as part of our systems business we conduct performance testing of a system prior to substantial completion to confirm the system meets its operational and capacity expectations noted in the epc agreement in addition we may provide an energy performance test during the first or second year of a system’s operation such a test is designed to demonstrate that the actual energy generation for the applicable year meets or exceeds the modeled energy expectation after certain adjustments these adjustments include factors such as irradiance weather module degradation soiling curtailment and other conditions that may affect a system’s energy output but are unrelated to the quality design or construction 

om services 

our typical om service arrangements involve the performance of standard activities associated with operating and maintaining a pv solar power system we perform such activities pursuant to the scope of services outlined in the underlying contract these activities are considered necessary to optimize system performance and comply with ppas other agreements and regulations although the scope of our services may vary by contract our om service arrangements generally include 247 system monitoring certain ppa and other agreement compliance nerc compliance large generator interconnection agreement compliance energy forecasting performance engineering analysis regular performance reporting turnkey maintenance services including spare parts and corrective maintenance repair warranty management and environmental services as part of our om services we also typically provide an effective availability guarantee which stipulates that a system will be available to generate a certain percentage of total possible energy during a specific period after adjusting for factors outside of our control as the service provider such as weather curtailment outages force majeure and other conditions that may affect system availability 

customers 

with respect to our systems business our customers consist of utilities independent power producers commercial and industrial companies and other system owners these customers may purchase completed pv solar power systems which include our solar modules or any combination of development epc services andor om services during 2016  the substantial majority of our systems business sales were in north america and the principal customers of our systems business were southern power company  nextera energy inc  and recurrent energy llc  each of which also accounted for more than 10  of the segment’s net sales 

competition 

with respect to our systems business we face competition from other providers of renewable energy solutions including developers of pv solar power systems and developers of other forms of renewable energy projects such as wind hydropower geothermal biomass and tidal projects to the extent other solar module manufacturers become more vertically integrated we expect to face increased competition from such companies as well we also face competition from other epc companies and joint venture type arrangements between epc companies and solar companies certain current or potential future competitors may also have a low cost of capital andor access to foreign capital while the decline in pv module prices over the last several years has increased interest in solar electricity worldwide there are limited barriers to entry in many parts of the pv solar value chain depending on the geographic market accordingly competition at the system level can be intense thereby exerting downward pressure on systemlevel profit margins industrywide to the extent competitors are willing and able to bid aggressively low prices for new projects and ppas using low cost assumptions for modules bos components installation maintenance and other costs please see item 1a “risk factors – competition at the system level can be intense thereby potentially exerting downward pressure on systemlevel profit margins industrywide which could reduce our profitability and adversely affect our results of operations ”

research development and engineering 

our systems business rd activities are primarily focused on the objective of lowering the lcoe of a pv solar power system through reductions in bos costs improved system design and energy yield enhancements associated with systems that use our modules these rd efforts are also focused on continuing to improve our systems in terms of grid integration and reliability we conduct our rd activities for the systems business primarily in the united states innovations related to system design inverters and power converters hardware platforms and installation techniques and knowhow among other things can and are expected in the future to continue to reduce bos costs which can represent a significant portion of the costs associated with the construction of a typical utilityscale pv solar power system 

for information regarding our research and development expense for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – results of operations” 

own and operate 

from time to time we may temporarily own and operate or retain interests in certain of our pv solar power systems often with the intention to sell at a later date the ability to do so allows us to gain control of the sales process provide a lower risk profile to a future buyer of a system and improve our ability to drive higher eventual sale values as of december 31 2016  we owned and operated a number of systems in various geographic markets including chile india and the united states as an owner and operator for certain of these systems we may be subject to the authority of the federal energy regulatory commission “ferc” as well as various other local state and federal regulatory bodies for more information about risks related to owning and operating such systems please see item 1a “risk factors – as an owner and operator of pv solar power systems that deliver electricity to the grid certain of our affiliated entities may be regulated as public utilities under us federal and state law which could adversely affect the cost of doing business and limit our growth ” for more information about the economics of such ownership and the impacts on our liquidity see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources” 

intellectual property 

our success depends in part on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technology and to conduct our business without infringing on the proprietary rights of others we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks and trade secrets as well as associate and thirdparty confidentiality agreements to safeguard our intellectual property we regularly file patent applications to protect inventions arising from our rd activities and are currently pursuing patent applications in the united states and other countries our patent applications and any future patent applications might not result in a patent being issued with the scope of the claims we seek or at all and any patents we may receive may be challenged invalidated or declared unenforceable in addition we have registered andor have applied to register trademarks and service marks in the united states and a number of foreign countries for “first solar” and “first solar and design” 

with respect to proprietary knowhow that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce we rely on among other things trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests we believe that many elements of our pv module manufacturing process including our unique materials sourcing involve proprietary knowhow technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications including technical processes equipment designs algorithms and procedures we have taken security measures to protect these elements our rd personnel have entered into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us these agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our associates to assign to us all of the inventions designs and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us we also require our customers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose sensitive aspects of our modules technology or business plans 

we have not been subject to any material intellectual property infringement or misappropriation claims

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the following information together with the other information in this annual report on form 10k before buying shares of our stock if any of the following risks or uncertainties occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our stock could decline 

  

risks related to our markets and customers 

competition in solar markets globally and across the solar value chain is intense and could remain that way for an extended period of time an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may continue to cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  

in the aggregate we believe manufacturers of solar modules and cells have significant installed production capacity relative to global demand and the ability for additional capacity expansion for example we estimate that in 2016 over 20 gw of capacity was added by solar module manufacturers particularly but not exclusively in asia we believe the solar industry may from time to time experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity exceeds global demand and that such periods will put intense pressure on pricing we believe the solar industry is currently in such a period during the past several years industry average sales prices per watt “asps” have declined at times significantly both at the module and system levels as competitors have reduced asps to sellthrough inventories worldwide in the us for example we believe that declines in asps have resulted in substantial part from solar module manufacturers undertaking actions to circumvent existing tariffs and duty structures in addition we believe that lower demand in the chinese market such as we believe occurred in the second half of 2016 was a key catalyst to the most recent decline in asps there may be additional pressure on global demand and asps in the future resulting from fluctuating demand in certain major solar markets such as china if our competitors reduce module pricing to levels near or below their manufacturing costs or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time or if demand for pv modules does not grow sufficiently to justify the current production supply our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

if pv and related technologies are not suitable for widespread adoption at economically attractive rates of return or if sufficient additional demand for solar modules related technologies and systems does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate our net sales and profit may flatten or decline and we may be unable to sustain profitability 

in comparison to fossil fuelbased electricity generation the solar energy market continues to be at a relatively early stage of development if utilityscale pv technology proves unsuitable for widespread adoption at economically attractive rates of return or if additional demand for solar modules and systems fails to develop sufficiently or takes longer to develop than we anticipate we may be unable to grow our business or generate sufficient net sales to sustain profitability in addition demand for solar modules related technologies and systems in our targeted markets may develop to a lesser extent than we anticipate many factors may affect the viability of widespread adoption of utilityscale pv technology in our targeted markets as well as the demand for solar modules and systems generally including the following 

 

 

 

 

 20 

 

 

 

the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives tax incentives renewable energy targets and other support for ongrid solar electricity applications or other adverse public policies could reduce demand andor price levels for our solar modules and systems and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales thereby adversely impacting our operating results  

although we believe that solar energy will experience widespread adoption in those applications where it competes economically with traditional forms of energy without any support programs in certain markets our net sales and profit remain subject to variability based on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives federal state and local governmental bodies in many countries have provided subsidies in the form of fits rebates tax incentives and other incentives to endusers distributors system integrators and manufacturers of pv solar products many of these support programs expire phase out over time require renewal by the applicable authority or may be amended a summary of certain recent developments in the major government support programs that may impact our business appears under item 1 “business – support programs” to the extent these support programs are reduced earlier than previously expected or are changed retroactively or freefield or conversion land applications are disadvantaged such changes could reduce demand andor price levels for our solar modules and systems lead to a reduction in our net sales and adversely impact our operating results another consideration in the us market and to a lesser extent in other global markets is the effect of governmental landuse planning policies and environmental policies on utilityscale pv solar development the adoption of restrictive landuse designations or environmental regulations that proscribe or restrict the siting of utilityscale solar facilities could adversely affect the marginal cost of such development 

in addition the results of the 2016 us presidential election may create regulatory uncertainty in the renewable energy industry including the solar energy industry and our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result members of the current us administration have made public statements that indicate that the administration may not be supportive of various clean energy programs and initiatives designed to curtail climate change and that it may be supportive of reducing the corporate tax rate and overturning or modifying policies of or regulations enacted by the prior administration that placed limitations on coal and gas electricity generation mining andor exploration if the current us administration andor the us congress takes action or continues to publicly speak out about the need to take action in furtherance of any such policies we would be subject to significant risks including the following 

 

 

 21 

 

 

these examples show that established markets for pv solar development such as the us market face uncertainties arising from policy regulatory and governmental constraints while the expected potential of the emerging markets we are targeting is significant policy promulgation and market development are especially vulnerable to governmental inertia political instability geopolitical risk fossil fuel subsidization potentially stringent localization requirements and limited available infrastructure 

we may be unable to fully execute on our long term strategic plan which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we face numerous difficulties in executing on our long term strategic plan particularly in new foreign jurisdictions including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 22 

 

 

 

in addition please see the risk factors entitled “ our substantial international operations subject us to a number of risks including unfavorable political regulatory labor and tax conditions in the united states andor foreign countries ” and “ the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives tax incentives renewable energy targets and other support for ongrid solar electricity applications or other adverse public policies could reduce demand andor price levels for our solar modules and systems and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales thereby adversely impacting our operating results ” 

we may be unable to profitably provide new solar offerings or achieve sufficient market penetration with such offerings 

we may expand our portfolio of offerings to include solutions that build upon our core competencies but for which we have not had significant historical experience including variations in our traditional product offerings or other offerings related to commercial and industrial customers and community solar we cannot be certain that we will be able to ascertain and allocate the appropriate financial and human resources necessary to grow these business areas we could invest capital into growing these businesses but fail to address market or customer needs or otherwise not experience a satisfactory level of financial return also in expanding into these areas we may be competing against companies that previously have not been significant competitors such as companies that currently have substantially more experience than we do in the rooftop commercial and industrial or other targeted offerings if we are unable to achieve growth in these areas our overall growth and financial performance may be limited relative to our competitors and our operating results could be adversely impacted 

an increase in interest rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets including a reduction in total tax equity availability could make it difficult for customers to finance the cost of a pv solar power system and could reduce the demand for our modules or systems andor lead to a reduction in the average selling price for such offerings  

many of our customers and our systems business depend on debt andor equity financing to fund the initial capital expenditure required to develop build andor purchase a pv solar power system as a result an increase in interest rates or a reduction in the supply of project debt financing or tax equity investments including due to a change in tax related incentives that benefit tax equity investors could reduce the number of solar projects that receive financing or otherwise make it difficult for our customers or our systems business to secure the financing necessary to develop build purchase or install a pv solar power system on favorable terms or at all and thus lower demand for our solar modules which could limit our growth or reduce our net sales see the risk factor entitled “ the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives tax incentives renewable energy targets and other support for ongrid solar electricity applications or other adverse public policies could reduce demand andor price levels for our solar modules and systems and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales thereby adversely impacting our operating results ” for additional information in addition we believe that a significant percentage of our endusers install systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt an increase in interest rates could lower an investor’s return on investment in a system increase equity return requirements or make alternative investments more attractive relative to pv solar power systems and in each case could cause these endusers to seek alternative investments 

  

we could be adversely affected by any violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” the uk bribery act and other foreign antibribery laws  

the fcpa generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business other countries in which we operate also have antibribery laws some of which prohibit improper payments to government and nongovernment persons and entities and others eg the fcpa and the uk bribery act extend their application to activities outside of their country of origin our policies mandate compliance with all applicable antibribery laws we currently operate in and pursuant to our long term strategic plan may further expand into key parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices in addition due to the level of regulation in our industry our operation in certain jurisdictions including india china south america and the middle east requires substantial government contact either directly by us or through intermediaries over whom we have less direct control such as subcontractors agents 

 23 

and partners such as joint venture partners where norms can differ from us standards although we have implemented policies procedures and in certain cases contractual arrangements designed to facilitate compliance with these antibribery laws our officers directors associates subcontractors agents and partners may take actions in violation of our policies procedures contractual arrangements and antibribery laws any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could subject us and such persons to criminal andor civil penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and reputation 

risks related to regulations 

existing regulations and policies changes thereto and new regulations and policies may present technical regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of pv products or systems which may significantly reduce demand for our modules systems or services 

the market for electricity generation products is heavily influenced by foreign federal state and local government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry as well as policies promulgated by electric utilities these regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customerowned electricity generation in the united states and in a number of other countries these regulations and policies have been modified in the past and may be modified again in the future these regulations and policies could deter enduser purchases of pv products or systems and investment in the rd of pv technology for example without a mandated regulatory exception for pv solar power systems utility customers are often charged interconnection or standby fees for putting distributed power generation on the electric utility grid if these interconnection standby fees were applicable to pv solar power systems it is likely that they would increase the cost of using such systems for endusers which could make the systems less desirable thereby adversely affecting our business financial condition and results of operations in addition with respect to utilities that utilize a peak hour pricing policy or timeofuse pricing methods whereby the price of electricity is adjusted based on electricity supply and demand electricity generated by pv solar power systems currently benefits from competing primarily with expensive peak hour electricity rather than the less expensive average price of electricity modifications to the peak hour pricing policies of utilities such as to a flat rate for all times of the day would require pv solar power systems to achieve lower prices in order to compete with the price of electricity from other sources and would adversely impact our operating results 

our modules systems and services such as om are subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with national and local ordinances relating to building codes safety environmental protection utility interconnection and metering and other matters and tracking the requirements of individual jurisdictions is complex any new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to our modules systems or services may result in significant additional expenses to us or our customers and as a result could cause a significant reduction in demand for our modules systems or services in addition any regulatory compliance failure could result in significant management distraction unplanned costs andor reputational damage 

environmental obligations and liabilities could have a substantial negative impact on our financial condition cash flows and results of operations   

our operations involve the use handling generation processing storage transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations at the national state local and international levels these environmental laws and regulations include those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the use management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites and occupational health and safety as we execute our long term strategic plan and expand our business into foreign jurisdictions worldwide our environmental compliance burden may continue to increase both in terms of magnitude and complexity we have incurred and may continue to incur significant costs in complying with these laws and regulations in addition violations of or liabilities under environmental laws or permits may result in restrictions being imposed on our operating activities or in our being subjected to substantial fines penalties criminal proceedings thirdparty property damage or personal injury claims cleanup costs or other costs such solutions could also result in substantial delay or termination of projects under construction within our systems business which could adversely impact our results of operations while we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements future developments such as more aggressive enforcement policies the implementation of new more stringent laws and regulations or the discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 24 

our solar modules contain cdte and other semiconductor materials elemental cadmium and certain of its compounds are regulated as hazardous materials due to the adverse health effects that may arise from human exposure based on existing research the risks of exposure to cdte are not believed to be as serious as those relating to exposure to elemental cadmium in our manufacturing operations we maintain engineering controls to minimize our associates’ exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds and require our associates who handle cadmium compounds to follow certain safety procedures including the use of personal protective equipment such as respirators chemical goggles and protective clothing relevant studies and thirdparty peer review of our technology have concluded that the risk of exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds from our endproducts is negligible in addition the risk of exposure is further minimized by the encapsulated nature of these materials in our products the physical properties of cadmium compounds used in our products and the recycling or responsible disposal of our modules while we believe that these factors and procedures are sufficient to protect our associates endusers and the general public from adverse health effects that may arise from cadmium exposure we cannot ensure that human or environmental exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds used in our products will not occur any such exposure could result in future thirdparty claims against us damage to our reputation and heightened regulatory scrutiny which could limit or impair our ability to sell and distribute our products the occurrence of future events such as these could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

the use of cadmium or cadmium compounds in various products is also coming under increasingly stringent governmental regulation future regulation in this area could impact the manufacturing sale collection and recycling of solar modules and could require us to make unforeseen environmental expenditures or limit our ability to sell and distribute our products for example european union directive 201165eu on the restriction of the use of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment recast rohs directive restricts the use of certain hazardous substances including cadmium and its compounds in specified products other jurisdictions such as china have adopted similar legislation or are considering doing so currently pv modules are explicitly excluded from the scope of recast rohs article 2 as adopted by the european parliament and the council in june 2011 the next general review of the rohs directive is scheduled for 2021 involving a broader discussion of the existing scope a scope review focusing on additional exclusions is expected to be proposed by the european commission in 2017 under the eu’s codecision process which allows the european parliament and the european council to amend the european commission’s proposal on exclusions the codecision procedure is expected to be completed in 2018 if pv modules were to be included in the scope of future rohs revisions without an exemption or exclusion we would be required to redesign our solar modules to reduce cadmium and other affected hazardous substances to the maximum allowable concentration thresholds in the rohs directive in order to continue to offer them for sale within the eu as such actions would be impractical this type of regulatory development would effectively close the eu market to us which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as an owner and operator of pv solar power systems that deliver electricity to the grid certain of our affiliated entities may be regulated as public utilities under us federal and state law which could adversely affect the cost of doing business and limit our growth   

as an owner and operator of pv solar power systems that deliver electricity to the grid certain of our affiliated entities may be considered public utilities for purposes of the federal power act as amended the “fpa” and public utility companies for purposes of the public utility holding company act of 2005 “puhca 2005” and are subject to regulation by the ferc as well as various local and state regulatory bodies 

some of our affiliated entities may be exempt wholesale generators or qualifying facilities under the public utility regulatory policies act of 1978 as amended “purpa” and as such are exempt from regulation under puhca 2005 in addition our affiliated entities may be exempt from most provisions of the fpa as well as state laws regarding the financial or organizational regulation of public utilities we are not directly subject to ferc regulation under the fpa however we are considered to be a “holding company” for purposes of section 203 of the fpa which regulates certain transactions involving public utilities and such regulation could adversely affect our ability to grow the business through acquisitions likewise investors seeking to acquire our public utility subsidiaries or acquire ownership interests in our securities sufficient to give them control over us and our public utility subsidiaries may require prior ferc approval to do so such approval could result in transaction delays or uncertainties 

public utilities under the fpa are required to obtain ferc acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of electricity and to comply with various regulations the ferc may grant our affiliated entities the authority to sell electricity at marketbased rates and may also grant them certain regulatory waivers such as waivers from compliance with ferc’s accounting regulations these ferc orders reserve the right to revoke or revise marketbased sales authority if the ferc subsequently determines that our affiliated entities can exercise market power in the sale of generation products the provision of transmission services or if it finds that any of the entities can create barriers to entry by competitors in addition if the entities fail to comply with certain reporting obligations the ferc may revoke their power sales tariffs finally if the entities were deemed to have engaged in manipulative or deceptive practices concerning their power sales transactions they would be subject to potential fines disgorgement 

 25 

of profits andor suspension or revocation of their marketbased rate authority if our affiliated entities were to lose their marketbased rate authority such companies would be required to obtain the ferc’s acceptance of a costofservice rate schedule and could become subject to the accounting recordkeeping and reporting requirements that are imposed on utilities with costbased rate schedules which would impose cost and compliance burdens on us and have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition to the risks described above we may be subject to additional regulatory regimes at state or foreign levels to the extent we own and operate pv solar power systems in such jurisdictions 

  

risks related to our operations manufacturing and technology 

our future success depends on our ability to effectively balance manufacturing production with market demand convert existing production facilities to support new product lines such as our transition to series 6 module manufacturing and when necessary continue to build new manufacturing plants over time in response to such demand and add production lines in a costeffective manner all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties  

our future success depends on our ability to effectively balance manufacturing production with market demand convert existing production facilities to support new product lines such as our transition to series 6 module manufacturing and increase both our manufacturing capacity and production throughput over time in a costeffective and efficient manner if we cannot do so we may be unable to expand our business decrease our manufacturing cost per watt maintain our competitive position satisfy our contractual obligations sustain profitability or realize our expected return on invested capital our ability to expand production capacity or to convert existing production facilities to support new product lines such as our transition to series 6 module manufacturing is subject to significant risks and uncertainties including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

our operating history to date may not serve as an adequate basis to judge our future prospects and results of operations 

our historical operating results may not provide a meaningful basis for evaluating our business financial performance and prospects we may be unable to achieve similar growth or grow at all in future periods our ability to achieve similar growth in future periods is also affected by current economic conditions our past results occurred in an environment where among other things capital was at times more accessible to our customers to finance the cost of developing solar projects and economic incentives for solar power in certain markets were more favorable accordingly you should not rely on our results of operations for any prior period as an indication of our future performance 

 26 

we face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules as well as other thinfilm solar modules if global supply continues to exceed global demand it could lead to a further reduction in the average selling price for pv modules  which could reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations 

the solar and renewable energy industries are highly competitive and are continually evolving as participants strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete with the larger electric power industry within the global pv solar industry we face intense competition from crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers and other thinfilm solar module manufacturers existing or future solar module manufacturers might be acquired by larger companies with significant capital resources thereby further intensifying competition with us in addition the introduction of a low cost disruptive technology such as commercially viable energy storage could adversely affect our ability to compete which could reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations 

even if demand for solar modules continues to grow the rapid manufacturing capacity expansion undertaken by many solar module manufacturers particularly manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules has created and may continue to cause periods of structural imbalance in which supply exceeds demand we believe the solar industry is currently in such a period see the risk factor entitled “ competition in solar markets globally and across the solar value chain is intense and could remain that way for an extended period of time an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may continue to cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations ” for additional information in addition we believe any significant decrease in the cost of silicon feedstock or polysilicon would reduce the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules and lead to further pricing pressure for solar modules and potentially an oversupply of solar modules we also believe the crystalline silicon module manufacturers are currently transitioning from multicrystalline wafer technology historically our primary competitor to more efficient monocrystalline wafer technology such transition is being facilitated by the emergence of new and low cost mono wafer suppliers primarily from china coupled with the gradual industry transition to passivated emitter rear contact “perc” cell technology as a result we expect that in the future our primary competition might transition from multicrystalline to monocrystalline perc with higher conversion efficiencies 

  

during any such period our competitors could decide to reduce their sales prices in response to competition even below their manufacturing costs in order to generate sales and may do so for a sustained period other competitors may have direct or indirect access to sovereign capital which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time as a result we may be unable to sell our solar modules or systems at attractive prices or for a profit during any period of excess supply of solar modules which would reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations also we may decide to lower our average selling prices to certain customers in certain markets in response to competition which could also reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations 

problems with product quality or performance may cause us to incur significant andor unexpected warranty and related expenses damage our market reputation and prevent us from maintaining or increasing our market share 

we perform a variety of module quality and life tests under different conditions upon which we base our assessments and warranty of module performance over the duration of the warranty however if our thinfilm solar modules perform below expectations we could experience significant warranty and related expenses damage to our market reputation and erosion of our market share with respect to our modules we provide a limited warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for generally 10 years we also typically warrant that modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 97 of their labeled power output rating during the first year with the warranty coverage reducing by 07 every year thereafter throughout the 25year performance warranty period as an alternative form of our module power output warranty we also offer an aggregated or systemlevel module performance warranty this systemlevel module performance warranty is designed for utilityscale systems and also provides 25year systemlevel energy degradation protection the systemlevel module performance warranty typically is calculated as a percentage of a system’s expected energy production adjusted for certain actual site conditions with the warranted level of performance declining each year in a linear fashion but never falling below 80 during the term of the warranty as a result of these programs we bear the risk of product warranty claims long after we have sold our solar modules and recognized net sales 

if any of the assumptions used in estimating our module warranties prove incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses which could adversely impact our financial position operating results and cash flows although we have taken significant precautions to avoid a manufacturing excursion from occurring any manufacturing excursions including any commitments made by us to take remediation actions in respect of affected modules beyond our warranties could adversely impact our reputation financial position operating results and cash flows 

 27 

although our module performance warranties extend for 25 years our oldest solar modules manufactured during the qualification of our pilot production line have only been in use since 2001 accordingly our warranties are based on a variety of quality and life tests that enable predictions of durability and future performance these predictions however could prove to be materially different from the actual performance during the warranty period causing us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective solar modules or provide financial remuneration in the future for example our solar modules could suffer various failure modes including breakage delamination corrosion or performance degradation in excess of expectations and our manufacturing operations or supply chain could be subject to materials or process variations that could cause affected modules to fail or underperform compared to our expectations these risks could be amplified as we implement design and process changes in connection with our efforts to improve our products and accelerate module conversion efficiencies as part of our long term strategic plan in addition as we increase the number of installations in extreme climates we may experience increased failure rates due to deployment into such field conditions any widespread product failures may damage our market reputation cause our net sales to decline require us to repair or replace the defective modules or provide financial remuneration and result in us taking voluntary remedial measures beyond those required by our standard warranty terms to enhance customer satisfaction which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

in resolving claims related to defective modules we typically have the option to repair or replace the covered modules provide additional modules or make a cash payment equal to the thencurrent market price of the modules however historical versions of our module warranty did not provide a refund remedy consequently we may be obligated to repair or replace the covered modules under such historical programs as our manufacturing process may change from timetotime in accordance with our technology roadmap we may elect to stop production of older versions of our modules that would constitute compatible replacement modules in some jurisdictions our inability to provide compatible replacement modules could potentially expose us to liabilities beyond the limitations of our module warranties which could adversely impact our reputation financial position operating results and cash flows 

in addition to our solar module warranties we also provide warranties for our bos equipment including but not limited to mounting structures solar trackers electronics and cabling these warranties cover defects in materials and workmanship for one to five years for most equipment and up to 10 years for mounting structures as with our modules these warranties are based on a variety of quality and life tests that enable predictions of durability and future performance for pv solar power systems we construct we also typically provide a limited warranty against defects in engineering design installation and workmanship for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a system any failures in bos equipment or system construction beyond our expectations may also adversely impact our reputation financial position operating results and cash flows 

as part of our systems business we may provide an energy performance test during the first year or two of a system’s operation such a test is designed to demonstrate that the actual energy generation for the applicable year meets or exceeds the modeled energy expectation after certain adjustments such as irradiance weather module degradation soiling curtailment and other conditions that may affect a system’s energy output but are unrelated to quality design or construction if there is an underperformance event determined at the end of the first or second year after substantial completion we may incur liquidated damages as a percentage of the contract price which may adversely impact our financial position operating results and cash flows 

if our estimates regarding the future costs of collecting and recycling cdte solar modules covered by our solar module collection and recycling program are incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses and face a significant unplanned cash burden 

as necessary we fund any incremental amounts for our estimated collection and recycling obligations each year we determine the funding requirement if any based on estimated costs of collecting and recycling covered modules estimated rates of return on our restricted investments and an estimated solar module life of 25 years less amounts already funded in prior years we estimate the cost of our collection and recycling obligations based on the present value of the expected probability weighted future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules which includes estimates for the cost of packaging materials the cost of freight from the solar module installation sites to a recycling center the material labor capital costs and scale of recycling centers and an estimated thirdparty profit margin and return on risk for collection and recycling services we base these estimates on i our experience collecting and recycling our solar modules ii the expected timing of when our solar modules will be returned for recycling and iii expected economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled if our estimates prove incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses and could also face a significant unplanned cash burden at the time we realize our estimates are incorrect or endusers return their modules which could adversely affect our operating results in addition participating endusers can return their modules covered under the collection and recycling program at any time as a result we could be required to collect and recycle covered cdte solar modules earlier than we expect 

 28 

our failure to further refine our technology reduce module manufacturing and bos costs and develop and introduce improved pv products could render our solar modules or systems uncompetitive and reduce our net sales profitability andor market share 

we need to continue to invest significant financial resources in rd to continue to improve our module conversion efficiencies lower the lcoe of our pv solar power systems and otherwise keep pace with technological advances in the solar industry however rd activities are inherently uncertain and we could encounter practical difficulties in commercializing our research results we seek to continuously improve our products and processes including for example through our recently announced intention to accelerate our transition to series 6 module manufacturing and the resulting changes carry potential risks in the form of delays additional costs or other unintended contingencies in addition our significant expenditures on rd may not produce corresponding benefits other companies are developing a variety of competing pv technologies including advanced multicrystalline silicon cells perc or advanced ptype crystalline silicon cells highefficiency ntype crystalline silicon cells copper indium gallium diselenide thin films amorphous silicon thin films and new emerging technologies such as hybrid perovskites which could produce solar modules or systems that prove more costeffective or have better performance than our solar modules or systems in addition other companies could potentially develop a highly reliable renewable energy system that mitigates the intermittent power generation drawback of many renewable energy systems or offer other valueadded improvements from the perspective of utilities and other system owners in which case such companies could compete with us even if the lcoe associated with such new systems is higher than that of our systems as a result our solar modules or systems may be negatively differentiated or rendered obsolete by the technological advances of our competitors which would reduce our net sales profitability andor market share in addition we often forward price our products and services in anticipation of future cost reductions and technology improvements and thus an inability to further refine our technology and execute our module conversion efficiency and cost reduction roadmaps could adversely affect our operating results 

our failure to protect our intellectual property rights may undermine our competitive position and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against thirdparty allegations of infringement may be costly 

protection of our proprietary processes methods and other technology is critical to our business failure to protect and monitor the use of our existing intellectual property rights could result in the loss of valuable technologies we rely primarily on patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property we regularly file patent applications to protect certain inventions arising from our rd and are currently pursuing such patent applications in various countries in accordance with our strategy for intellectual property in that jurisdiction our existing patents and future patents could be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents or if patents are issued to us such patents may not be sufficient to provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies 

we also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position although we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our associates and third parties to protect our intellectual property such confidentiality agreements are limited in duration and could be breached and may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary manufacturing expertise adequate remedies may not be available in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise in addition others may obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or legal means the failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes equipment technology trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise methods and compounds could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries especially any developing countries into which we may expand our operations in some countries we have not applied for patent trademark or copyright protection 

  

third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary technologies or other intellectual property rights which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology can be difficult and expensive also litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others we cannot ensure that the outcome of such potential litigation will be in our favor and such litigation may be costly and may divert management attention and other resources away from our business an adverse determination in any such litigation may impair our intellectual property rights and may harm our business prospects and reputation in addition we have no insurance coverage against such litigation costs and would have to bear all costs arising from such litigation to the extent we are unable to recover them from other parties 

 29 

several of our key raw materials and components are either singlesourced or sourced from a limited number of thirdparty suppliers and their failure to perform could cause manufacturing delays and impair our ability to deliver solar modules to customers in the required quality and quantities and at a price that is profitable to us 

our failure to obtain raw materials and components that meet our quality quantity and cost requirements in a timely manner could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture our solar modules or increase our manufacturing cost several of our key raw materials and components are either singlesourced or sourced from a limited number of thirdparty suppliers as a result the failure of any of our suppliers to perform could disrupt our supply chain and adversely impact our operations in addition some of our suppliers are small companies that may be unable to supply our increasing demand for raw materials and components as we expand our business we may be unable to identify new suppliers or qualify their products for use on our production lines in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms a constraint on our production may cause us to be unable to meet our capacity plans andor our obligations under our customer contracts which would have an adverse impact on our business additionally reductions in our production volume may put pressure on suppliers resulting in increased material and component costs 

a disruption in our supply chain for cdte could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture solar modules and could adversely impact our profitability and longterm growth prospects 

a key raw material used in our module production process is a cdte compound tellurium one of the main components of cdte is mainly produced as a byproduct of copper refining and therefore its supply is largely dependent upon demand for copper our supply of cdte could be limited if any of our current suppliers or any of our future suppliers are unable to acquire an adequate supply of tellurium in a timely manner or at commercially reasonable prices if our current suppliers or any of our future suppliers cannot obtain sufficient tellurium they could substantially increase prices or be unable to perform under their contracts furthermore if our competitors begin to use or increase their demand for tellurium our requirements for tellurium increase or new applications for tellurium become available the supply of tellurium and related cdte compounds could be reduced and prices could increase as we may be unable to pass such increases in the costs of our raw materials through to our customers a substantial increase in tellurium prices or any limitations in the supply of tellurium could adversely impact our profitability and longterm growth objectives 

if any future production lines are not built in line with our committed schedules it may impair any future growth plans if any future production lines do not achieve operating metrics similar to our existing production lines our solar modules could perform below expectations and cause us to lose customers   

if we are unable to systematically replicate our production lines as necessary over time and achieve and sustain similar operating metrics in our future production lines as we have achieved at our existing production lines our manufacturing capacity could be substantially constrained our manufacturing costs per watt could increase and our growth could be limited such factors may result in lower net sales and lower net income than we anticipate for instance future production lines could produce solar modules that have lower conversion efficiencies higher failure rates and higher rates of degradation than solar modules from our existing production lines and we could be unable to determine the cause of the lower operating metrics or develop and implement solutions to improve performance 

some of our manufacturing equipment is customized and sole sourced if our manufacturing equipment fails or if our equipment suppliers fail to perform under their contracts we could experience production disruptions and be unable to satisfy our contractual requirements 

some of our manufacturing equipment including manufacturing equipment related to the production of our series 6 modules is customized to our production lines based on designs or specifications that we provide to equipment manufacturers which then undertake a specialized process to manufacture the custom equipment as a result the equipment is not readily available from multiple vendors and would be difficult to repair or replace if it were to become damaged or stop working if any piece of equipment fails production along the entire production line could be interrupted in addition the failure of our equipment manufacturers to supply equipment in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms could delay our expansion or conversion plans otherwise disrupt our production schedule andor increase our manufacturing costs all of which would adversely impact our operating results 

 30 

we may be unable to manage the expansion of our operations effectively 

we expect to continue to expand our business in order to provide utilityscale pv solar energy solutions to existing and new geographic markets and to maintain or increase our market share to manage the continued expansion of our operations we would be required to continue to improve our operational and financial systems as well as our procedures and controls our management would also be required to maintain and expand our relationships with customers suppliers and other third parties and attract new customers and suppliers in addition our current and planned operations personnel systems and internal controls and procedures might be inadequate to support our future growth the effectiveness of our controls and procedures could be adversely impacted to the extent we transfer more business functions to lower cost geographies as part of our cost reduction initiatives if we cannot manage our growth effectively we may be unable to take advantage of market opportunities execute our business strategies or respond to competitive pressures 

our substantial international operations subject us to a number of risks including unfavorable political regulatory labor and tax conditions in the united states andor foreign countries  

we have significant development construction sales marketing and manufacturing operations both within and outside the united states and expect to continue to expand our operations worldwide as a result we are subject to the legal political social tax and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions risks inherent to international operations include but are not limited to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 31 

 

   

our business in foreign markets requires us to respond to rapid changes in market conditions in these countries our overall success as a global business depends in part on our ability to succeed in differing legal regulatory economic social and political conditions we may not be able to develop and implement policies and strategies that will be effective in each location where we do business 

risks related to our systems business 

project development or construction activities may not be successful projects under development may not receive required permits real property rights ppas interconnection and transmission arrangements or financing or construction may not commence or proceed as scheduled which could increase our costs and impair our ability to recover our investments  

the development and construction of solar energy generation facilities and other energy infrastructure projects involve numerous risks we may be required to spend significant sums for land and interconnection rights preliminary engineering permitting legal services and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built success in developing a particular project is contingent upon among other things

successful completion of a particular project may be adversely affected delayed andor rendered infeasible by numerous factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 33 

if we fail to complete the development of a solar energy project fail to meet one or more agreed upon target construction milestone dates fail to achieve systemlevel capacity or fail to meet other contract terms we may be subject to forfeiture of significant deposits under ppas or interconnection agreements or termination of such agreements incur significant liquidated damages penalties andor other obligations under other project related agreements and may not be able to recover our investment in the project some of these investments are included as assets on our consolidated balance sheets under the line item “ project assets and deferred project costs ” if we are unable to complete the development of a solar energy project we may writedown or writeoff some or all of these capitalized investments which would have an adverse impact on our net income in the period in which the loss is recognized 

we may be unable to acquire or lease land obtain necessary interconnection and transmission rights andor obtain the approvals licenses permits and electric transmission grid interconnection and transmission rights necessary to build and operate pv solar power systems in a timely and cost effective manner and regulatory agencies local communities labor unions tribes or other third parties may delay prevent or increase the cost of construction and operation of the system we intend to build 

in order to construct and operate our pv solar power systems we need to acquire or lease land and rights of way obtain interconnection rights negotiate agreements with affected transmission systems and obtain all necessary local county state federal and foreign approvals licenses and permits as well as rights to interconnect the systems to the transmission grid and transmit energy generated from the system we may be unable to acquire the land or lease interests needed may not obtain or maintain satisfactory interconnection rights may have difficulty reaching agreements with affected transmission systems andor incur unexpected network upgrade costs may not receive or retain the requisite approvals permits licenses and interconnection and transmission rights or may encounter other problems that could delay or prevent us from successfully constructing and operating such systems 

  

many of our proposed projects are located on or require access through public lands administered by federal and state agencies pursuant to competitive public leasing and rightofway procedures and processes other of our proposed projects are located on tribal land pursuant to land agreements that must be approved by tribal governments and federal agencies the authorization for the use construction and operation of systems and associated transmission facilities on federal tribal state and private lands will also require the assessment and evaluation of mineral rights private rightsofway and other easements environmental agricultural cultural recreational and aesthetic impacts and the likely mitigation of adverse impacts to these and other resources and uses the inability to obtain the required permits and other federal tribal state and local approvals and potentially any excessive delays in obtaining such permits and approvals due for example to litigation or thirdparty appeals could prevent us from successfully constructing and operating such systems in a timely manner and could result in the potential forfeiture of any deposit we have made with respect to a given project moreover project approvals subject to project modifications and conditions including mitigation requirements and costs could affect the financial success of a given project changing regulatory requirements and the discovery of unknown site conditions could also affect the financial success of a given project 

in addition local labor unions may increase the cost of andor lower the productivity of project development in california and elsewhere we may also be subject to labor unavailability andor increased union labor requirements due to multiple simultaneous projects in a geographic region 

competition at the system level can be intense thereby potentially exerting downward pressure on systemlevel profit margins industrywide which could reduce our profitability and adversely affect our results of operations  

the significant decline in pv module prices over the last several years continues to create a challenging environment for module manufacturers but it has also increased interest in solar electricity worldwide by eroding one of the primary historical constraints to widespread solar market penetration namely its affordability aided by such lower module prices our customers and potential customers have in many cases been willing and able to bid aggressively for new projects and ppas using low cost assumptions for modules bos components installation maintenance and other costs as the basis for such bids relatively low barriers to entry for solar project developers and epc companies including those we compete with have led to depending on the market and other factors intense competition at the system level intense competition at the system level can result in an environment in which systemlevel pricing falls rapidly thereby further increasing demand for solar solutions but constraining the ability for project developers epc companies andor verticallyintegrated solar companies such as first solar to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability accordingly while we believe our system offerings and experience are positively differentiated in many cases from that of our competitors we may fail to correctly identify our competitive position we may be unable to develop or maintain a sufficient magnitude of new system projects worldwide at economically attractive rates of return and we may not otherwise be able to achieve meaningful profitability under our long term strategic plan 

 34 

depending on the market opportunity we may be at a disadvantage compared to potential systemlevel competitors for example certain of our competitors may have a stronger andor more established localized business presence in a particular geographic region certain of our competitors may be larger entities that have greater financial resources and greater overall brand name recognition than we do and as a result may be better positioned to impact customer behavior or adapt to changes in the industry or the economy as a whole certain competitors may also have direct or indirect access to sovereign capital andor other incentives which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time 

additionally largescale solar systems are still in their relatively early stages of existence and depending on the geographic area certain potential customers may still be in the process of educating themselves about the points of differentiation among various available providers of pv solar solutions including a company’s proven overall experience and bankability system design and optimization expertise grid interconnection and stabilization expertise and proven om capabilities if we are unable over time to meaningfully differentiate our offerings at scale or if available competitive pricing is prioritized over the value we believe is added through our system offerings and experience from the viewpoint of our potential customer base our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

we may not be able to obtain longterm contracts for the sale of power produced by our projects at prices and on other terms favorable to attract financing and other investments  with regard to projects for which electricity is or will be sold on an opencontract basis rather than under a ppa our results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent prevailing spot electricity prices decline in an unexpected manner 

obtaining longterm contracts for the sale of power produced by our projects at prices and on other terms favorable to us is essential for obtaining financing and commencing construction of our projects we must compete for ppas against other developers of solar and renewable energy projects this intense competition for ppas has resulted in downward pressure on ppa pricing for newly contracted projects in addition we believe the solar industry is currently experiencing a period of structural imbalance between supply and demand that is putting downward pressure on module pricing this downward pressure on module pricing also creates downward pressure on ppa pricing for newly contracted projects see the risk factor entitled “ competition at the system level can be intense thereby potentially exerting downward pressure on systemlevel profit margins industrywide which could reduce our profitability and adversely affect our results of operations ” for additional information if falling ppa pricing results in projected project revenue that is insufficient to generate returns anticipated to be demanded in the project sale market our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

other sources of power such as natural gasfired power plants have historically been cheaper than the cost of solar power and certain types of generation projects such as natural gasfired power plants can deliver power on a firm basis the inability to compete successfully against other power producers or otherwise enter into ppas favorable to us would negatively affect our ability to develop and finance our projects and negatively impact our revenue in addition the availability of ppas is dependent on utility and corporate energy procurement practices that could evolve and shift allocation of market risks over time in addition ppa availability and terms are a function of a number of economic regulatory tax and public policy factors which are also subject to change also certain of our projects may be scheduled for substantial completion prior to the commencement of a longterm ppa with a major offtaker in which case we would be required to enter into a stubperiod ppa for the intervening time period or sell down the project we may not be able to do either on terms that are commercially attractive to us finally the electricity from certain of our projects is or is expected to be sold on an opencontract basis for a period of time rather than under a ppa if prevailing spot electricity prices relating to any such project were to decline in an unexpected manner such project may decline in value and our results of operations could otherwise be adversely affected 

lack of transmission capacity availability potential upgrade costs to the transmission grid and other systems constraints could significantly impact our ability to build pv solar power systems and generate solar electricity power sales 

  

in order to deliver electricity from our pv solar power systems to our customers our projects generally need to connect to the transmission grid the lack of available capacity on the transmission grid could substantially impact our projects and cause reductions in project size delays in project implementation increases in costs from transmission upgrades and potential forfeitures of any deposit we have made with respect to a given project in addition there could be unexpected costs required to complete transmission and network upgrades that adversely impact the economic viability of our pv solar power systems these transmission and network issues and costs as well as issues relating to the availability of large equipment such as transformers and switch gear could significantly impact our ability to interconnect our systems to the transmission grid build such systems and generate solar electricity sales 

  

 35 

our systems business is largely dependent on us and third parties arranging financing from various sources which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms or in insufficient amounts 

  

the construction of large utilityscale solar power projects in many cases requires project financing including nonrecourse project debt financing in the bank loan market and institutional debt capital markets uncertainties exist as to whether our planned projects will be able to access the debt markets in a magnitude sufficient to finance their construction if we are unable to arrange such financing or if it is only available on unfavorable terms we may be unable to fully execute our systems business plan in addition we generally expect to sell interests in our projects by raising project equity capital from taxoriented strategic industry and other equity investors such equity sources may not be available or may only be available in insufficient amounts or on unfavorable terms in which case our ability to sell interests in our projects may be delayed or limited and our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected uncertainty in or adverse changes to tax policy including the amount of itc accelerated depreciation and marginal corporate tax rate may reduce project value or negatively affect our ability to timely secure equity investment for our projects even if such financing sources are available the counterparty to many of our fixedprice epc contracts which own the project we are constructing are often special purpose vehicles that do not have significant assets other than their interests in the project and have pledged all or substantially all of these assets to secure the projectrelated debt and certain other sources of financing if the owner defaults on its payments or other obligations to us we may face difficulties in collecting payment of amounts due to us for the costs previously incurred or for the amounts previously expended or committed to be expended to purchase equipment or supplies including intercompany purchases of pv modules or for termination payments we are entitled to under the terms of the related epc contract if we are unable to collect the amounts owed to us or are unable to complete the project because of an owner default we may be required to record a charge against earnings related to the project which could result in a material loss 

  

in addition for projects to which we provide epc services but are not the project developer our epc activities are in many cases dependent on the ability of third parties to finance their system projects on acceptable terms depending on prevailing conditions in the credit markets interest rates and other factors such financing may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms or in insufficient amounts if third parties are limited in their ability to access financing to support their purchase of pv solar power system construction services from us we may not realize the cash flows that we expect from such sales which could adversely affect our ability to invest in our business andor generate revenue see also the risk factor above entitled “ an increase in interest rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets including a reduction in total tax equity availability could make it difficult for customers to finance the cost of a pv solar power system and could reduce the demand for our modules or systems andor lead to a reduction in the average selling price for such offerings  ” 

  

developing solar power projects may require significant upfront investment prior to the signing of an epc contract and commencing construction or the signing of a module sale agreement which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our solar power project development cycles which span the time between the identification of a site location and the construction of a system vary substantially and can take years to mature as a result of these long project development cycles we may need to make significant upfront investments of resources including for example payments for land rights large transmission and ppa deposits or other payments which may be nonrefundable in advance of the signing of epc contracts commencing construction the signing of a module sale agreement receiving cash proceeds or recognizing any revenue which may not be recognized for several additional months or years following contract signing our potential inability to enter into sales contracts with potential customers on favorable terms after making such upfront investments could cause us to forfeit certain nonrefundable payments or otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations furthermore we may become constrained in our ability to simultaneously fund our other business operations and these systems investments through our long project development cycles 

our liquidity may also be adversely affected to the extent the project sales market weakens and we are unable to sell interests in our solar projects on pricing timing and other terms commercially acceptable to us in such a scenario we may choose to continue to temporarily own and operate certain solar projects for a period of time after which interests in the projects may be sold to third parties 

 36 

we may be unable to accurately estimate costs under fixedprice epc agreements in which we act as the general contractor for our customers in connection with the construction and installation of their pv solar power systems 

we may enter into fixedprice epc contracts in which we act as the general contractor for our customers in connection with the installation of their pv solar power systems all essential costs are estimated at the time of entering into the epc contract for a particular project and these are reflected in the overall fixedprice that we charge our customers for the project these cost estimates are preliminary and may or may not be covered by contracts between us or the subcontractors suppliers and other parties to the project in addition we require qualified licensed subcontractors to install many of our systems shortages of such skilled labor could significantly delay a project or otherwise increase our costs should actual results prove different from our estimates including those due to unexpected increases in inflation commodity prices or labor costs or we experience delays in execution and we are unable to commensurately increase the epc sales price we may not achieve our expected margins or we may be required to record a loss in the relevant fiscal period 

we may be subject to unforeseen costs liabilities or obligations when providing om services in addition certain of our om agreements include provisions permitting the counterparty to terminate the agreement without cause 

we may provide ongoing om services to system owners under separate service agreements pursuant to which we generally perform standard activities associated with operating a pv solar power system including 247 monitoring and control compliance activities energy forecasting and scheduled and unscheduled maintenance our costs to perform these services are estimated at the time of entering into the om agreement for a particular project and these are reflected in the price we charge our customers including certain agreements which feature fixed pricing should our estimates of om costs prove inaccurate including any unexpected increases in inflation labor or bos costs our growth strategy and results of operations could be adversely affected because of the potentially longterm nature of these om agreements the adverse impacts on our results of operations could be significant particularly if our costs are not capped under the terms of the agreements in addition certain of our om agreements include provisions permitting the counterparty to terminate the agreement without cause or for convenience the exercise of such termination rights or the use of such rights as leverage to renegotiate terms and conditions of the om agreement including pricing terms could adversely impact our results of operations we may also be subject to substantial costs in the event we do not achieve certain thresholds under the effective availability guarantees included in our om agreements 

our systems business is subject to regulatory oversight and liability if we fail to operate our pv solar power systems in compliance with electric reliability rules 

the ongoing om services that we provide for system owners may subject us to regulation by the nerc or its designated regional representative as a “generator operator” or “gop” under electric reliability rules filed with ferc our failure to comply with the reliability rules applicable to gops could subject us to substantial fines by nerc subject to ferc’s review in addition the system owners that receive our om services may be regulated by nerc as “generator owners” or “gos” and we may incur liability for go violations and fines levied by nerc subject to ferc’s review based on the terms of our om agreements finally as a system owner and operator we may in the future be subject to regulation by nerc as a go 

other risks 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future business combinations or transactions and integration of these business combinations may disrupt our business and management 

we have made several acquisitions in prior years and in the future we may acquire additional companies project pipelines products or technologies or enter into joint ventures or other strategic initiatives we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such business combinations or other investments and each transaction has numerous risks these risks include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 37 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mergers and acquisitions of companies are inherently risky and ultimately if we do not complete the integration of acquired businesses successfully and in a timely manner we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions to the extent anticipated which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the formation of 8point3 energy partners lp on a timely basis or at all  

in june 2015 the partnership formed by the sponsors completed its initial public offering the “ipo” the yieldco is a joint venture vehicle into which we and sunpower each contributed a portfolio of selected solar generation assets from our existing portfolios of assets since the formation of the partnership we and sunpower have from time to time continued to sell interests in solar projects to the partnership we launched the yieldco to enable a competitive cost of capital and greater optionality in the project sales process for a portion of our future project interest sales given the broader economic factors currently impacting the yieldco sector in general including yieldco equity valuations generally the timing and execution of project sales to the partnership are subject to market conditions we believe that the viability of the yieldco strategy will depend on among other things such market conditions the yieldco’s ability to finance project interest acquisitions and our ability to continue to develop revenuegenerating solar assets which is subject to the same projectlevel business and industry risks described in the other risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k the viability of the yieldco strategy is also subject to the risks described in the yieldco’s annual report on form 10k in addition due to the joint venture nature of the yieldco we do not exercise control over the yieldco in the same manner that we could over our whollyowned subsidiaries and as such the viability of the yieldco strategy will also depend in part on our ability to effectively manage our business relationships with sunpower furthermore the value of our investment in the yieldco will fluctuate over time and may decline as a result we may never recover the value of the assets we contributed to the yieldco and we may realize less of a return on such contributions than if we had retained or operated the assets in addition our stock price may be impacted by fluctuations in the price of yieldco shares and market perceptions about the value of our interest in the yieldco if we are unable to achieve the strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the yieldco strategy we would pursue traditional and other pathways in the project sales process but our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected see note 12 “investments in unconsolidated affiliates and joint ventures”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding the partnership 

 38 

our future success depends on our ability to retain our key associates and to successfully integrate them into our management team 

we are dependent on the services of our executive officers and other members of our senior management team the loss of one or more of these key associates or any other member of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business we may not be able to retain or replace these key associates and may not have adequate succession plans in place several of our current key associates including our executive officers are subject to employment conditions or arrangements that contain postemployment noncompetition provisions however these arrangements permit the associates to terminate their employment with us upon little or no notice and the enforceability of the noncompetition provisions in certain jurisdictions is uncertain 

if we are unable to attract train and retain key personnel our business may be materially and adversely affected any regulatory compliance failure with respect to applicable labor laws and regulations including the davisbacon and related acts could have an adverse effect on us 

our future success depends to a significant extent on our ability to attract train and retain management operations sales training and technical personnel including in foreign jurisdictions recruiting and retaining capable personnel particularly those with expertise in the pv industry across a variety of technologies are vital to our success there is substantial competition for qualified technical personnel and while we continue to benchmark our organization against the broad spectrum of business in our market space to remain economically competitive there can be no assurances that we will be able to attract and retain our technical personnel if we are unable to attract and retain qualified associates or otherwise experience unexpected labor disruptions within our business we may be materially and adversely affected 

labor used on some of our job sites that are completed or under construction are subject to the davisbacon and related acts collectively “davisbacon” davisbacon requires that personnel assigned to the project be paid at least the prevailing wage and fringe benefits as established by and in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the us department of labor “dol” we have an established policy pursuant to which we evaluate davisbacon requirements in conjunction with our subcontractors on the project and ensure our collective compliance with these requirements if it was ultimately determined that any person working under davisbacon requirements on first solar projects was not properly classified was being paid the incorrect prevailing wage or had not been paid fringe benefits to which he or she was entitled we could incur additional liability with respect to such worker or be exposed to other adverse outcomes for example in march 2015 the wage and hour division of the dol notified our whollyowned subsidiary first solar electric llc “fse” of the dol’s findings following a labor standards compliance review under davisbacon at the agua caliente project in southwestern arizona fse served as the general contractor for the project the dol alleges that certain workers at the project were misclassified and as a result of that misclassification were not paid the required prevailing wage we disagree with certain of the dol’s investigative findings and are currently reviewing those issues of disagreement with the dol possible adverse outcomes include the payment of back wages to certain project workers we do not expect the outcome of the dol proceeding to have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we may be exposed to infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties which if determined adversely to us could cause us to pay significant damage awards or prohibit us from the manufacture and sale of our solar modules or the use of our technology 

our success depends largely on our ability to use and develop our technology and knowhow without infringing or misappropriating the intellectual property rights of third parties the validity and scope of claims relating to pv technology patents involve complex scientific legal and factual considerations and analysis and therefore may be highly uncertain we may be subject to litigation involving claims of patent infringement or violation of intellectual property rights of third parties the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits patent opposition proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings can be both costly and time consuming and may significantly divert the efforts and resources of our technical and management personnel an adverse determination in any such litigation or proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liability to third parties require us to seek licenses from third parties which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all or pay ongoing royalties require us to redesign our solar modules or subject us to injunctions prohibiting the manufacture and sale of our solar modules or the use of our technologies protracted litigation could also result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of our solar modules until the resolution of such litigation 

 39 

currency translation and transaction risk may negatively affect our results of operations 

although our reporting currency is the us dollar we conduct certain business and incur costs in the local currency of most countries in which we operate as a result we are subject to currency translation and transaction risk for example certain of our net sales in 2016  were denominated in foreign currencies such as euros australian dollars and indian rupees  and we expect to continue to have net sales denominated in foreign currencies in the future in addition our operating expenses for our manufacturing plants located outside the united states and our operations for our systems business in foreign countries will generally be denominated in local currencies joint ventures or other business arrangements with strategic partners outside of the united states have involved and are expected in the future to involve significant investments denominated in local currencies changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar could affect our results of operations and result in exchange gains or losses we cannot accurately predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations 

we could also expand our business into emerging markets many of which have an uncertain regulatory environment relating to currency policy conducting business in such emerging markets could cause our exposure to changes in exchange rates to increase due to the relatively high volatility associated with emerging market currencies and potentially longer payment terms for our proceeds 

our ability to hedge foreign currency exposure is dependent on our credit profile with the banks that are willing and able to do business with us deterioration in our credit position or a significant tightening of the credit market conditions could limit our ability to hedge our foreign currency exposures and therefore result in exchange gains or losses 

sustained declines in worldwide oil prices could adversely affect trading prices of our common shares 

worldwide oil prices have declined over the last few years and may continue to decline or remain low oil is used as a fuel for electricity generation in only a small percentage of applications worldwide compared to natural gas or coalfired electricity generation and other forms of electricity generation and accordingly fluctuations in oil prices generally do not have a significant direct causal effect on prevailing competitive electricity prices including electricity from solar sources nonetheless there can be an observed market correlation effect between declining oil prices and depressed equity valuations of solar companies if oil prices remain low or continue to decline the trading price of our common shares may suffer 

we are subject to litigation risks including securities class actions and stockholder derivative actions which may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain 

from time to time we are subject to legal claims with and without merit that may be costly and which may divert the attention of our management and our resources in general in addition our projects may be subject to litigation or other adverse proceedings that may adversely impact our ability to proceed with construction or sell a given project which may adversely affect our ability to recognize revenue with respect to such project the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict moreover many of the complaints filed against us do not specify the amount of damages that plaintiffs seek and we therefore are unable to estimate the possible range of damages that might be incurred should these lawsuits be resolved against us certain of these lawsuits assert types of claims that if resolved against us could give rise to substantial damages and an unfavorable outcome or settlement of one or more of these lawsuits or any future lawsuits may result in a significant monetary judgment or award against us or a significant monetary payment by us and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations even if these lawsuits or any future lawsuits are not resolved against us the costs of defending such lawsuits may be significant and may not be covered by our insurance policies because the price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile we can provide no assurance that additional securities or other litigation will not be filed against us in the future for more information on our legal proceedings including our securities class action and derivative actions see “ note 16 “commitments and contingencies”  under the heading “legal proceedings” of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k

our largest stockholder has significant influence over us and its interests may conflict with or differ from interests of other stockholders 

our largest stockholder lukas t walton the “significant stockholder” owned approximately 22  of our outstanding common stock at december 31 2016  as a result the significant stockholder has substantial influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of our directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions such as mergers tender offers and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets the interests of the significant stockholder could conflict with or differ from interests of other stockholders for example the concentration of ownership held by the significant stockholder could delay defer or prevent a change of control of our company or impede a merger takeover or other business combination which other stockholders may view favorably 

if our goodwill longlived assets or project related assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 

we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings should we determine that our goodwill longlived assets or project related assets are impaired such a charge may have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations during the year ended december 31 2016  we recorded significant impairment charges associated with the end of our crystalline silicon module manufacturing operations and expected transition to series 6 module manufacturing as discussed further in note 4 “restructuring and asset impairments”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

  

as required by accounting rules we review our goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill is less than its carrying value factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill might not be recoverable include a deterioration in general economic conditions a deterioration in the environment in which we operate declines in our actual or projected financial performance certain companyspecific events or a sustained decrease in our stock price and market capitalization we review longlived and project related assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances arise that may indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable we consider a project commercially viable and recoverable if it is anticipated to be sellable for a profit once it is either fully developed or constructed or if the expected operating cash flows from future power generation exceed the cost basis of the asset if our projects are not considered commercially viable we would be required to impair the respective assets 

unanticipated changes in our tax provisions the enactment of new tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the jurisdictions in which we operate our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge for our modules systems services licenses funding and intercompany transactions we are subject to potential tax examinations in various jurisdictions and taxing authorities may disagree with our interpretations of us and foreign tax laws and may assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these examinations in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however the outcome of tax examinations cannot be predicted with certainty therefore the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of such examinations could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision which could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows in addition our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure losses of tax holidays changes in the mix of earnings in countries with tax holidays or differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process a number of proposals for broad reform of the corporate tax system in the united states are under evaluation by various legislative and administrative bodies but it is not possible to accurately determine the overall impact of such proposals on our effective tax rate at this time changes in tax laws or regulations including multijurisdictional changes enacted in response to the guidelines provided by the organization for economic cooperation and development to address base erosion and profit sharing may also increase tax uncertainty and adversely affect our results of operations 

 41 

cyber attacks or other breaches of our information systems or those of third parties with which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our operations rely on our computer systems hardware software and networks as well as those of the third parties with which we do business to securely process store and transmit proprietary confidential and other information including intellectual property such information systems may be compromised by cyber attacks computer viruses and other events that could be materially disruptive to our business operations and could put the security of our information and that of the third parties with which we do business at risk of misappropriation or destruction in recent years such cyber incidents have become increasingly frequent and sophisticated targeting or otherwise affecting a wide range of companies while we have instituted security measures to minimize the likelihood and impact of a cyber incident there is no assurance that these measures or those of the third parties with which we do business will be adequate in the future if these measures fail valuable information may be lost our manufacturing development construction om and other operations may be disrupted and our reputation may suffer we may also be subject to litigation regulatory action remedial expenses and financial losses beyond the scope or limits of our insurance coverage these consequences of a failure of security measures could individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

changes in or any failure to comply with privacy laws regulations and standards may adversely affect our business 

personal privacy and data security have become significant issues in the united states europe and in many other jurisdictions in which we operate the regulatory framework for privacy and security issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future for example in 2015 the court of justice of the european union ruled that the useu safe harbor framework which provided us companies with a streamlined means of complying with the european union’s data protection directive regarding the treatment of customers’ and employees’ personal information and other privacy matters and upon which we relied for the transfer of personal data from the eu to the us was invalid as a result of such invalidation we have been required to implement data transfer agreements between certain of our us and eu based entities furthermore federal state or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted and may in the future adopt laws and regulations affecting data privacy all of which may be subject to invalidation by relevant foreign judicial bodies industry organizations also regularly adopt and advocate for new standards in this area in the united states these include rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of federal agencies and state attorneys general and legislatures and consumer protection agencies internationally many jurisdictions in which we operate have established their own data security and privacy legal framework with which we or our customers must comply including but not limited to the data protection directive established in the european union and data protection legislation of the individual member states subject to such directive the data protection directive will be replaced in 2018  with the pending european general data protection regulation which will impose additional obligations penalties and risk upon our business in many jurisdictions enforcement actions and consequences for noncompliance are also rising in addition to government regulation privacy advocates and industry groups may propose new and different selfregulatory standards that either legally or contractually apply to us any inability or perceived inability to adequately address privacy and security concerns even if unfounded or comply with applicable privacy and data security laws regulations and policies could result in additional cost and liability to us damage our reputation inhibit sales and adversely affect our business 

our credit agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business 

we may be unable to respond to changes in business and economic conditions engage in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us and obtain additional financing if needed because the senior secured credit facility made available under our amended and restated credit agreement with several financial institutions as lenders and jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent the “revolving credit facility” and certain of our project financing arrangements contain and other future debt agreements may contain covenant restrictions that limit our ability to among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 42 

under our revolving credit facility and certain of our project financing arrangements we are also subject to certain financial covenants our ability to comply with covenants under our credit agreements is dependent on our future performance or the performance of specifically financed projects which will be subject to many factors some of which are beyond our control including prevailing economic conditions in addition our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under these agreements and any of our other future debt agreements which if not cured or waived could permit the holders thereof to accelerate such debt and could cause crossdefaults under our other facility agreements and the possible acceleration of debt under such other facility agreements as well as crossdefaults under certain of our key project and operational agreements and could also result in requirements to post additional security instruments to secure future obligations in addition we cannot assure you that events that occur within the company or in the industry or the economy as a whole will not constitute material adverse effects under these agreements if it is determined that a material adverse effect has occurred the lenders can under certain circumstances restrict future borrowings or accelerate the due date of outstanding loan balances if any of our debt is accelerated we may not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt and may experience crossdefaults under our other debt agreements or project and key operational agreements which could materially and negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations

market overview 

the solar industry continues to be characterized by intense pricing competition both at the module and system levels in particular module average selling prices in the united states and several other key markets have experienced an accelerated decline in recent months and module average selling prices are expected to continue to decline to some degree in the short and medium terms according to market forecasts in the aggregate we believe manufacturers of solar modules and cells have significant installed production capacity relative to global demand and the ability for additional capacity expansion we believe the solar industry may from time to time experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity exceeds global demand and that such periods will put pressure on pricing we believe the solar industry is currently in such a period additionally intense competition at the system level may result in an environment in which pricing falls rapidly thereby further increasing demand for solar energy solutions but constraining the ability for project developers epc companies and verticallyintegrated solar companies such as first solar to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability in light of such market realities we are executing our long term strategic plan under which we are focusing on our competitive strengths such strengths include our advanced module and system technologies as well as our verticallyintegrated business model that enables us to provide utilityscale pv solar energy solutions to key markets with current electricity needs 

worldwide solar markets continue to develop in part aided by demand elasticity resulting from declining industry average selling prices both at the module and system level which make solar power more affordable to new markets we are developing constructing or operating multiple solar projects around the world many of which are the largest or among the largest in their regions we continue to execute on our advancedstage utilityscale project pipeline which includes the construction of some of the world’s largest pv solar power systems we expect a substantial portion of our consolidated net sales operating income and cash flows through the end of 2018  to be derived from these projects we continue to advance the development and selling efforts for the other projects included in our advancedstage utilityscale project pipeline develop our earlytomid stage project pipeline and evaluate acquisitions of projects to expand our advancedstage utilityscale project pipeline see the tables under “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – systems project pipeline” for additional information about these and other projects within our systems business advancedstage project pipeline 

lower industry module and system pricing while currently challenging for certain solar manufacturers particularly manufacturers with high cost structures is expected to continue to contribute to global market diversification and volume elasticity over time declining average selling prices are consistent with the erosion of one of the primary historical constraints to widespread solar market penetration its affordability in the near term however declining average selling prices are expected to adversely affect our results of operations relative to prior years if competitors reduce pricing to levels below their costs bid aggressively low prices for module sale agreements epc agreements and ppas or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time our results of operations could be further adversely affected in certain markets in california and elsewhere an oversupply imbalance at the grid level may further contribute to reduced shorttomedium term demand for new solar installations relative to prior years lower ppa pricing and lower margins on module and systems sales to such markets we continue to mitigate these uncertainties in part by executing on our module technology improvements including our transition to series 6 module manufacturing continuing the development of key markets and implementing certain other cost reduction initiatives including both manufacturing and bos costs 

we continue to face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules and other types of solar modules and pv solar power systems solar module manufacturers compete with one another on price and on several module value attributes including conversion efficiency energy yield and reliability and with respect to pv solar power systems net present value return on equity and lcoe meaning the net present value of total life cycle costs of the system divided by the quantity of energy which is expected to be produced over the system’s life as noted above competition on the basis of selling price per watt has intensified in recent months resulting in sharp declines in module average selling prices in several key markets in addition we believe crystalline silicon cell and wafer manufacturers have begun transitioning from lower efficiency back surface field “bsf” multicrystalline cells the legacy technology against which we generally compete in our markets to higher efficiency perc multicrystalline and monocrystalline cells at potentially competitive cost structures 

 48 

we believe we are among the lowest cost pv module manufacturers in the solar industry on a module cost per watt basis based on publicly available information this cost competitiveness is reflected in the price at which we sell our modules and fully integrated pv solar power systems and enables our systems to compete favorably our cost competitiveness is based in large part on our module conversion efficiency proprietary manufacturing technology which enables us to produce a cdte module in less than 35  hours using a continuous and highly automated industrial manufacturing process as opposed to a batch process and our operational excellence in addition our cdte modules use approximately 12  of the amount of the semiconductor material that is used to manufacture traditional crystalline silicon solar modules the cost of polysilicon is a significant driver of the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules and the timing and rate of change in the cost of silicon feedstock and polysilicon could lead to changes in solar module pricing levels polysilicon costs have had periods of decline over the past several years and polysilicon consumption per cell has been reduced through the adoption of diamond wafer saw technology contributing to a decline in our relative manufacturing cost competitiveness over traditional crystalline silicon module manufacturers 

given the smaller size sometimes referred to as form factor of our current series 4 cdte modules compared to certain types of crystalline silicon modules we may incur higher labor and bos costs associated with the construction of systems using our modules thus to compete effectively on an lcoe basis our series 4 modules may need to maintain a certain cost advantage per watt compared to crystalline siliconbased modules with larger form factors we recently introduced our next generation series 6 module technology which is expected to enable the production of modules with a larger form factor along with better product attributes and a lower manufacturing cost structure accordingly the larger form factor of our series 6 modules is expected to reduce the number of electrical connections and hardware required for system installation the resulting labor and material savings are expected to represent a significant improvement compared to current technologies and a substantial reduction in total installed costs resulting in improved project returns as bos costs represent a significant portion of the costs associated with the construction of a typical utilityscale system see note 4 “restructuring and asset impairments”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2016  included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding the transition to series 6 module manufacturing 

in terms of energy yield in many climates our cdte modules provide a significant energy production advantage over most conventional crystalline silicon solar modules including bsf and perc technologies of equivalent efficiency rating for example our cdte solar modules provide a superior temperature coefficient which results in stronger system performance in typical high insolation climates as the majority of a system’s generation on average occurs when module temperatures are well above 25°c standard test conditions in addition our cdte modules provide a superior spectral response in humid environments where atmospheric moisture alters the solar spectrum relative to laboratory standards our cdte solar modules also provide a better shading response than conventional crystalline silicon solar modules which may lose up to three times as much power as cdte solar modules when shading occurs as a result of these and other factors our pv solar power systems typically produce more annual energy in real world field conditions than competing systems with the same nameplate capacity 

while our modules and pv solar power systems are generally competitive in cost reliability and performance attributes there can be no guarantee such competitiveness will continue to exist in the future to the same extent or at all any declines in the competitiveness of our products could result in additional margin compression further declines in the average selling prices of our modules and systems erosion in our market share for modules and systems decreases in the rate of net sales growth andor declines in overall net sales we continue to focus on enhancing the competitiveness of our solar modules and pv solar power systems by accelerating progress along our module technology and cost reduction roadmaps continuing to make technological advances at the system level using innovative installation techniques and knowhow and leveraging volume procurement around standardized hardware platforms such procurement efforts include the use of highquality conventional bos components as we have phased out the use of our proprietary trackers and fixed mounting structures to further reduce system costs and streamline our operations 

certain trends and uncertainties 

we believe that our operations may be favorably or unfavorably impacted by the following trends and uncertainties that may affect our financial condition and results of operations see item 1a “risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of other risks that may affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 49 

long term strategic plan 

our long term strategic plan is a longterm roadmap to achieve our technology growth and cost leadership objectives in executing our long term strategic plan we are focusing on providing utilityscale pv solar energy solutions using our modules in key geographic markets that we believe have a compelling need for massscale pv electricity including markets throughout the americas the asiapacific region and the middle east as part of our long term strategic plan we are focusing on opportunities in which our pv solar energy solutions can compete directly with fossil fuel offerings on an lcoe or similar basis or complement such fossil fuel electricity offerings execution of the long term strategic plan entails a prioritization of market opportunities worldwide relative to our core strengths and a corresponding allocation of resources around the globe this prioritization involves a focus on our core module and utilityscale offerings and exists within a current market environment that includes rooftop and distributed generation solar particularly in the united states while it is unclear how rooftop and distributed generation solar might impact our core utilityscale offerings in the next several years we believe that utilityscale solar will continue to be a compelling solar offering for companies with technology and cost leadership and will continue to represent an increasing portion of the overall electricity generation mix 

we are closely evaluating and managing the appropriate level of resources required as we pursue the most advantageous and cost effective projects and partnerships in our target markets we have dedicated and intend to continue to dedicate significant capital and human resources to reduce the total installed cost of pv solar energy to optimize the design and logistics around our pv solar energy solutions and to ensure that our solutions integrate well into the overall electricity ecosystem of each specific market we expect that over time an increasing portion of our consolidated net sales operating income and cash flows may come from solar offerings in the key geographic markets described above as we execute on our long term strategic plan the timing execution and financial impacts of our long term strategic plan are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in item 1a “risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k we are focusing our resources in those markets and energy applications in which solar power can be a leastcost bestfit energy solution particularly in regions with high solar resources significant current or projected electricity demand andor relatively high existing electricity prices as part of these efforts we continue to optimize resources globally including business development sales personnel and other supporting professional staff in target markets 

joint ventures or other strategic arrangements with partners are a key part of our long term strategic plan and we generally use such arrangements to expedite our penetration of various key markets and establish relationships with potential customers we also enter into joint ventures or strategic arrangements with customers or other entities to maximize the value of particular projects some of these arrangements involve and are expected in the future to involve significant investments or other allocations of capital we continue to develop relationships with customers in these strategic markets with a view to creating opportunities for utilityscale pv solar power systems we sell such systems directly to end customers including utilities independent power producers commercial and industrial companies and other system owners depending on the market opportunity our sales offerings may range from moduleonly sales to module sales with a range of development epc services and other solutions to full turnkey pv solar power system sales we expect these offerings to continue to evolve over time as we work with our customers to optimize how our pv solar energy solutions can best meet our customers’ energy and economic needs 

in order to create or maintain a market position in certain strategically targeted markets our offerings from time to time may need to be competitively priced at levels associated with minimal gross profit margins which may adversely affect our results of operations we expect the profitability associated with our various sales offerings to vary from one another over time and possibly vary from our internal longrange profitability expectations and targets depending on the market opportunity and the relative competitiveness of our offerings compared with other energy solutions fossil fuelbased or otherwise that are available to potential customers in addition as we execute on our long term strategic plan we will continue to monitor and adapt to any changing dynamics in the market set of potential buyers of solar project assets market environments with few potential project buyers and a higher cost of capital would generally exert downward pressure on the potential revenue from the uncontracted solar project assets we are developing whereas conversely market environments with many potential project buyers and a lower cost of capital would likely have a favorable impact on the potential revenue from such uncontracted solar project assets 

 50 

we expect to use our working capital project financing arrangements or availability under our revolving credit facility to finance the construction of certain pv solar power systems for strategic purposes or to maximize the value of such systems at the time of sale from time to time we may temporarily own and operate certain pv solar power systems often with the intention to sell at a later date we may also elect to construct and temporarily retain ownership interests in systems for which there is no ppa with an offtaker such as a utility but rather an intent to sell the electricity produced by the system on an open contract basis until the system is sold additionally our joint ventures and other business arrangements with strategic partners have and may in the future result in us temporarily retaining a noncontrolling ownership interest in the underlying systems projects we develop supply modules to or construct potentially for a period of up to several years such business arrangements could become increasingly important to our competitive profile in markets globally including north america in each of the above mentioned examples we may retain such ownership interests in a consolidated or unconsolidated separate entity 

we continually evaluate forecasted global demand competition and our addressable market and seek to effectively balance manufacturing capacity with market demand and the nature and extent of our competition to the extent we make investments to add or otherwise modify our manufacturing capacity in response to market demand and competition such investments would require significant internal and possibly external sources of liquidity and would be subject to certain risks and uncertainties described in item 1a risk factors including those entitled “ our future success depends on our ability to effectively balance manufacturing production with market demand convert existing production facilities to support new product lines such as our transition to series 6 module manufacturing and when necessary continue to build new manufacturing plants over time in response to such demand and add production lines in a costeffective manner all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties ” and “ if any future production lines are not built in line with our committed schedules it may impair any future growth plans if any future production lines do not achieve operating metrics similar to our existing production lines our solar modules could perform below expectations and cause us to lose customers ” 

8point3 energy partners lp 

in june 2015 the partnership completed the ipo as part of the ipo we contributed interests in various projects to a subsidiary of the partnership in exchange for an ownership interest in the entity since the formation of the partnership we and sunpower have from time to time continued to sell interests in solar projects to the partnership the partnership owns and operates a portfolio of solar energy generation projects and is expected to acquire additional interests in projects from the sponsors in addition the partnership is expected to provide the sponsors with optionality in the project sales process given the broader economic factors currently impacting the yieldco sector in general including yieldco equity valuations generally the timing and execution of project sales to the partnership are subject to market conditions for additional information see item 1a “risk factors – we may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the formation of 8point3 energy partners lp on a timely basis or at all ” and “ note 12 “investments in unconsolidated affiliates and joint ventures  – 8point3 energy partners lp” of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

construction of some of the world’s largest pv solar power systems 

we continue to execute on our advancedstage utilityscale project pipeline and expect a substantial portion of our consolidated net sales operating income and cash flows through the end of 2018  to be derived from several large projects in this pipeline including the following contracted projects which will be among the world’s largest pv solar power systems the 280 mw california flats project located in monterey county california the 250 mw moapa project located in clark county nevada the 150 mw rosamond project located in kern county california and the 150 mw sun streams project located in maricopa county arizona please see the tables under “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – systems project pipeline” for additional information about these and other projects within our systems business advancedstage project pipeline the construction progress of these projects is subject to risks and delays as described in item 1a “risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k revenue recognition for these and other system projects is in many cases not linear in nature due to the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria are met and consequently periodoverperiod comparisons of results of operations may not be meaningful expected revenue from projects without a ppa for which electricity will be sold on an open contract basis may be subject to greater variability and uncertainty based on market factors compared to projects with a ppa

systems project pipeline 

the following tables summarize as of february 22 2017  our approximately 20 gw  systems business advancedstage project pipeline as of december 31 2016  for the projects soldunder contract in our advancedstage project pipeline of 275 mw  we have not recognized any significant amount of revenue the remaining revenue to be recognized subsequent to december 31 2016  for the projects soldunder contract is expected to be approximately 08 billion  the majority of such revenue is expected to be recognized through the later of the substantial completion or closing dates of the projects the remaining revenue to be recognized does not have a direct correlation to expected remaining module shipments for such projects soldunder contract as expected module shipments do not represent total systems revenues and do not consider the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria are met including the timing of module installation the actual volume of modules installed in our projects soldunder contract will be greater than the project size in mw ac as module volumes required for a project are based upon mw dc which will be greater than the mw ac size pursuant to a dcac ratio typically ranging from 12 to 13 such ratio varies across different projects due to various system design factors projects are removed from our advancedstage project pipeline tables below once we have substantially completed construction and after substantially all revenue has been recognized projects or portions of projects may also be removed from the tables below in the event an epccontracted or partnerdeveloped project does not obtain permitting or financing an unsold or uncontracted project is not sold or contracted due to the changing economics of the project or other factors or we decide to temporarily own and operate or retain interests in such projects based on strategic opportunities or market factors 

in january 2017 we discontinued development of the 310 mw ac tribal solar project the development of solar energy projects such as the tribal solar project involves numerous risks and typically requires developers such as first solar to spend significant sums and devote substantial resources to a project before a determination can be made whether the project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built for more information about the risks associated with project development see item 1a “risk factors – project development or construction activities may not be successful projects under development may not receive required permits real property rights ppas interconnection and transmission arrangements or financing or construction may not commence or proceed as scheduled which could increase our costs and impair our ability to recover our investments ” in light of significant uncertainties and risks related to the land use rights and obtaining the required permits and approvals among other factors and our experience developing over 6 gw of solar energy projects we made the determination that it would not be prudent to continue development of the tribal solar project we therefore notified sce that we were unwilling to pay the excess costs related to certain transmission upgrades and new transmission facilities and the ppa was terminated pursuant to its terms accordingly sce has released to us the full amount of the performance security and we have ceased development activities related to the tribal solar project as of december 31 2016 we estimated that the tribal solar project was 2 completed and had a likely substantial completion date if any in 2021 

we continually seek to make additions to our advancedstage project pipeline we are actively developing our early to midstage project pipeline in order to secure ppas and are also pursuing opportunities to acquire advancedstage projects which already have ppas in place new additions to our project pipeline during the period from february 24 2016 to february 22 2017  included a 126 mw ac solar power project in california 60 mw ac of solar power projects in india a 49 mw ac solar power project in australia 41 mw ac of solar power projects in japan a 40 mw ac solar power project in california and a 25 mw ac solar power project in honduras

results of operations 

the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  



segment overview 

we operate our business in two segments our components segment involves the design manufacture and sale of cdte solar modules which convert sunlight into electricity and our systems segment includes the development construction operation and maintenance of pv solar power systems which primarily use our solar modules 

see note 23   “segment and geographical information ”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2016  included in this annual report on form 10k for more information on our operating segments see also item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – systems project pipeline” for a description of the system projects in our advancedstage project pipeline 

product revenue 

the following table sets forth the total amounts of solar module and solar power system net sales for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  for the purpose of the following table i solar module revenue is composed of revenue from the sale of solar modules to third parties which does not include any modules sold as part of our pv solar power systems and ii solar power system revenue is composed of revenue from the sale of pv solar power systems and related products and services including any modules installed in such systems and any revenue generated by such systems in thousands 



solar module revenue to third parties increased  by 4480 million  during 2016  compared to 2015  primarily as a result of a 211 increase in the volume of watts sold partially offset by a 5 decrease in the average selling price per watt solar power system revenue decreased  by 10757 million  during 2016  compared to 2015  primarily from the sale of majority interests in the north star and lost hills projects in 2015  the completion of substantially all construction activities on the imperial solar energy center west and decatur projects in 2015  the completion of substantially all construction activities on the silver state south and mccoy projects in the first half of 2016  and lower revenue from module plus transactions this decrease in revenue was partially offset by higher revenue from the commencement of construction on the taylor and butler projects in late 2015  and the commencement of construction on the east pecos project in early 2016  

 54 

solar module revenue to third parties decreased  by 09 million  during 2015  compared to 2014  primarily due to a 10 decrease in the average selling price per watt partially offset by an 11 increase in the volume of watts sold solar power system revenue increased  by 1887 million  during 2015  compared to 2014  primarily due to higher revenue from module plus transactions our net sales for 2015  also included the sale of majority interests in the partially constructed desert stateline project and north star project and higher revenue from the silver state south mccoy and imperial energy center west projects which commenced construction in late 2014  these 2015  net sales were offset by lower revenue from the completion or substantial completion of the desert sunlight solar gen 2 topaz and campo verde projects in 2014  

net sales 

components business 

we generally price and sell our solar modules per watt of nameplate power during 2016  a significant portion of net sales for our components business included modules installed in our pv solar power systems described below under “net sales – systems business” other than the modules included in our systems we sold the majority of our solar modules to integrators and operators of systems in india the united states and the uae 

from time to time we enter into module sales agreements with customers worldwide for specific projects or volumes of modules such agreements are generally shortterm in nature during 2016  substantially all of our components business net sales excluding modules installed in our systems were denominated in us dollars 

we transfer title and risk of loss to the customer and recognize revenue upon shipment or delivery depending on the terms of the underlying sales contracts pricing is typically fixed or determinable at the time of shipment and our customers generally do not have extended payment terms or rights of return under these contracts the revenue recognition policies for our components business are described further in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2016  included in this annual report on form 10k 

during 2016  southern power company  and nextera energy inc  each accounted for more than 10 of our components business’ net sales which includes the solar modules used in our systems projects 

systems business 

through our fully integrated systems business we provide complete turnkey pv solar power systems or solar solutions which may include project development epc services and om services additionally we may temporarily own and operate or retain interests in certain of our pv solar power systems which are also included within our systems business we typically use the percentageofcompletion method using actual costs incurred over total estimated costs to construct a project including module costs as our standard accounting policy and apply this method after all revenue recognition criteria have been met there are also instances in which we recognize revenue after a project has been completed primarily due to a project not being sold prior to completion or because all revenue recognition criteria have not been met the revenue recognition policies for our systems business are described in further detail in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2016  included in this annual report on form 10k 

during 2016  the majority of our systems business net sales were generated in north america and the principal customers of our systems business were southern power company  nextera energy inc  and recurrent energy llc  each of which accounted for more than 10 of the segment’s net sales 

the following table shows net sales by reportable segment for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  



 55 

net sales from our components segment which includes solar modules used in our systems projects increased  by 947 million  in 2016  primarily as a result of a 17 increase in the volume of watts sold partially offset by a 9 decrease in the average selling price per watt net sales from our systems segment which excludes solar modules used in our systems projects decreased  by 7224 million  in 2016  primarily from the sale of majority interests in the north star and lost hills projects in 2015  the completion of substantially all construction activities on the imperial solar energy center west and decatur projects in 2015  and the completion of substantially all construction activities on the silver state south and mccoy projects in the first half of 2016  this decrease in revenue was partially offset by higher revenue from the commencement of construction on the taylor and butler projects in late 2015  and the commencement of construction on the east pecos project in early 2016  

net sales from our components segment which includes solar modules used in our systems projects increased  by 2869 million  in 2015  primarily due to a 33 increase in the volume of watts sold partially offset by a 5 decrease in the average selling price per watt net sales from our systems segment which excludes solar modules used in our systems projects decreased  by 991 million  in 2015  primarily as a result of lower revenue from the completion or substantial completion of the desert sunlight solar gen 2 topaz and campo verde projects in 2014 these decreases were partially offset by the sale of majority interests in the partially constructed desert stateline project and north star project and higher revenue from the silver state south mccoy and imperial solar energy center west projects which commenced construction in late 2014 

cost of sales   

components business 

our cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials and components for manufacturing solar modules such as glass transparent conductive coatings cdte and other thinfilm semiconductors laminate materials connector assemblies edge seal materials and other materials and components in addition our cost of sales includes direct labor for the manufacturing of solar modules and manufacturing overhead such as engineering equipment maintenance environmental health and safety quality and production control information technology and procurement costs our cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing plant and equipment facilityrelated expenses and costs associated with shipping warranties and our solar module collection and recycling obligation excluding accretion 

as further described in note 23   “segment and geographical information ”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2016  included in this annual report on form 10k we include the sale of solar modules manufactured by our components business and used by our systems business within net sales of our components business therefore the related cost of sales is also included within our components business 

systems business 

for our systems business projectrelated costs include development costs legal consulting transmission upgrade interconnection permitting and other similar costs standard epc costs consisting primarily of bos costs for inverters electrical and mounting hardware project management and engineering costs and construction labor costs and site specific costs 

the following table shows cost of sales by reportable segment for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  



 56 

our cost of sales decreased   4124 million  or 16  and increased   18 percentage points  as a percentage of net sales when comparing 2016  with 2015  the decrease  in cost of sales was primarily the result of a 4761 million   decrease  in our systems segment cost of sales primarily due to the volume of projects under construction and the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria were met this net decrease was partially offset by a 637 million   increase  in our components segment cost of sales primarily due to the following 

 

our cost of sales increased   935 million  or 4  and decreased   14 percentage points  as a percentage of net sales when comparing 2015  with 2014  the increase  in cost of sales was driven by a 609 million   increase  in our systems segment cost of sales primarily due to a mix of lower gross profit system projects sold or under construction during the period our components segment cost of sales increased by 326 million  primarily as a result of the following 

 

gross profit 

gross profit  is affected by numerous factors including the selling prices of our modules and systems our manufacturing costs bos costs project development costs the capacity utilization of our manufacturing facilities and foreign exchange rates gross profit  is also affected by the mix of net sales generated by our components and systems businesses 

the following table shows gross profit for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  



  

gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased  by 18 percentage points  during 2016  compared with 2015  primarily due to the mix of lower gross profit projects sold and under construction higher inventory writedowns and the reduction in our module collection and recycling obligation in 2015 as described above partially offset by the higher gross margins on modules sold to third parties gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased  by 14 percentage points during 2015  compared with 2014  primarily due to a reduction in our module collection and recycling obligation and improved utilization of our manufacturing facilities 

 57 

research and development 

research and development  expense consists primarily of salaries and personnelrelated costs the cost of products materials and outside services used in our process and product rd activities and depreciation and amortization expense associated with rd specific facilities and equipment we maintain a number of programs and activities to improve our technology and processes in order to enhance the performance and reduce the costs of our solar modules and pv solar power systems using our modules 

the following table shows research and development expense for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  



the decrease  in our research and development expense during 2016  compared to 2015  was primarily due to reductions in our rd headcount and employee compensation expense resulting from the restructuring activities further discussed in note 4 “restructuring and asset impairments”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2016  included in this annual report on form 10k during 2016  the average conversion efficiency of our cdte solar modules produced was 164  compared to 156  in 2015  

the decrease  in our research and development expense during 2015  compared to 2014  was primarily due to reduced material and module testing costs associated with the development of nextgeneration cdte solar modules and lower costs for outside services partially offset by higher employee compensation expense during 2015  the average conversion efficiency of our cdte solar modules was 156  compared to 140  in 2014  

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative  expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated costs professional fees insurance costs travel expenses and other business development and selling expenses 

the following table shows selling general and administrative expense for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  



our selling general and administrative expense increased  by 68 million  or 3  and was 89  and 71  as a percentage of net sales when comparing 2016  with 2015  respectively the increase  was primarily attributable to higher development costs for earlystage projects and impairments of certain project assets partially offset by lower employee compensation expense due to the various restructuring activities described in note 4 “restructuring and asset impairments”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2016  included in this annual report on form 10k and lower professional fees associated with the formation and ipo of the partnership 

our selling general and administrative expense increased  by 14 million  or 1  and was 71  and 75  as a percentage of net sales when comparing 2015  with 2014  respectively the increase  was primarily due to higher employee compensation expense and higher professional fees associated with the formation and ipo of the partnership partially offset by lower project development expense and lower accretion expense associated with the reduction in our module collection and recycling obligation

production startup   

production startup  expense consists primarily of employee compensation and other costs associated with operating a production line before it has been qualified for full production including the cost of raw materials for solar modules run through the production line during the qualification phase and applicable facility related costs costs related to equipment upgrades and implementation of manufacturing process improvements are also included in production startup expense as well as costs related to the selection of a new site including related legal and regulatory costs to the extent we cannot capitalize these expenditures in general we expect production startup expense per production line to be higher when we build an entirely new manufacturing facility compared with the addition of new production lines at an existing manufacturing facility primarily due to the additional infrastructure investment required when building an entirely new facility 

the following table shows production startup expense for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  



during 2016  we incurred certain production startup expense related to our next generation cdte module offerings production startup expense for 2015 was primarily related to our previous crystalline silicon manufacturing operations at our facility in kulim malaysia which commenced during the third quarter of 2014 

restructuring and asset impairments 

restructuring and asset impairments includes those expenses incurred related to material restructuring initiatives and includes any associated asset impairments costs for employee termination benefits costs for contract terminations and penalties and other restructuring related costs such restructuring initiatives are intended to align the organization with current business conditions and to reduce costs 

the following table shows restructuring and asset impairments for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  



during 2016  our restructuring and asset impairments included 6625 million  of charges primarily related to our november 2016 decision to accelerate our transition to series 6 module manufacturing and restructure our operations 875 million  of charges associated with the end of our crystalline silicon module manufacturing operations and 688 million  of goodwill impairment charges see note 4 “restructuring and asset impairments”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2016  included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information we expect to incur up to 80 million  of additional charges related to these actions as we complete the transition to series 6 modules manufacturing in 2017 and 2018 as a result of these actions we also expect to reduce our annual cost of sales and operating expenses by approximately 80 million and 60 million respectively 

 59 

foreign currency loss net   

foreign currency loss net  consists of the net effect of gains and losses resulting from holding assets and liabilities and conducting transactions denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries’ functional currencies 

the following table shows foreign currency loss net for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  



foreign currency loss net increased during 2016  compared with 2015  primarily as a result of hedging activities related to our subsidiaries in india as well as differences between our economic hedge positions and the underlying exposures along with changes in foreign currency rates foreign currency loss net increased during 2015  compared with 2014  primarily due to differences between our economic hedge positions and the underlying exposure along with changes in foreign currency rates 

interest income 

interest income  is earned on our cash cash equivalents marketable securities and restricted cash and investments interest income also includes interest earned from notes receivable and late customer payments 

the following table shows interest income for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  



interest income during 2016   increased  compared to 2015  primarily as a result of improved yields on our fixed income marketable securities interest income during 2015   increased  compared to 2014  primarily as a result of higher average balances of notes receivable due from affiliates 

interest expense net   

interest expense is incurred on various debt financings we capitalize interest expense into our project assets or property plant and equipment when such costs qualify for interest capitalization which reduces the amount of net interest expense reported in any given period 

the following table shows interest expense net for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  



interest expense net of amounts capitalized increased  in 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to lower interest costs capitalized to certain projects that were substantially completed in 2016 and higher levels of project specific debt financings outstanding during 2016 interest expense net of amounts capitalized increased  in 2015  compared to 2014  primarily as a result of higher levels of project specific debt financings 

other income expense net 

other income expense net  is primarily comprised of miscellaneous items and realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities and cost method investments 

the following table shows other expense net for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  



 60 

other income expense net   increased  in 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to realized gains of 413 million  on the sale of certain restricted investments driven by an effort to align the currencies of the investments with those of the corresponding collection and recycling liabilities the resolution of an outstanding matter with a former customer and the reversal of the outstanding contingent consideration associated with our tetrasun acquisition as the result of our executive management’s decision to end production of our crystalline silicon modules which adversely affected the likelihood of achieving certain module shipment volume milestones partially offset by the impairment of a cost method investment see note 4 “restructuring and asset impairments”  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion relating to these restructuring activities other income expense net  in 2015 was consistent with other income expense net in 2014  

income tax expense benefit 

income tax expense or benefit deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect our best estimate of current and future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which we operate principally australia india and malaysia significant judgments and estimates are required in determining our consolidated income tax expense the statutory federal corporate income tax rate in the united states is 350 while the tax rates in australia india and malaysia are 300  346  and 240  respectively in malaysia we have been granted a longterm tax holiday scheduled to expire in 2027  pursuant to which substantially all of our income earned in malaysia is exempt from income tax 

the following table shows income tax expense benefit for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  



our tax rate is affected by recurring items such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions the rate is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year but are not consistent from year to year income tax expense increased  by 644 million  during 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to certain us taxes on a cash distribution received from our foreign subsidiary partially offset by tax benefits from restructuring charges and a 354 million  reversal of an uncertain tax position related to the income of a foreign subsidiary income tax expense decreased  by 373 million  during 2015  compared with 2014  the decrease  in income tax expense was primarily the result of a 417 million  discrete tax benefit associated with the receipt of a private letter ruling during 2015 see note 20 “income taxes”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates net of tax   

equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates net of tax represents our proportionate share of the earnings or losses of unconsolidated affiliates with whom we have made equity method investments as well as any gains or losses on the sale or disposal of such investments 

the following table shows equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates net of tax for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  



equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates net of tax   increased  during 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to the recognition of a gain of  1251 million  net of tax on the sale of our residual interest in the desert stateline project to 8point3 operating company llc “opco” a subsidiary of the partnership higher equity in earnings from our investments in opco and higher equity in earnings from our investment in the desert stateline project prior to its sale equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates net of tax   increased  during 2015  compared to 2014 primarily as a result of our investment in opco along with the impairment of certain equity method investments during 2014  

 61 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2016  we believe that our cash cash equivalents marketable securities cash flows from operating activities including the contracted portion of our advancedstage project pipeline availability under our revolving credit facility considering minimum liquidity covenant requirements and access to the capital markets will be sufficient to meet our working capital systems project investment and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months we monitor our working capital to ensure we have adequate liquidity both domestically and internationally 

we intend to maintain appropriate debt levels based upon cash flow expectations our overall cost of capital and expected cash requirements for operations capital expenditures and strategic discretionary spending in the future we may also engage in additional debt or equity financings including project specific debt financings we believe that when necessary we will have adequate access to the capital markets although our ability to raise capital on terms commercially acceptable to us could be constrained if there is insufficient lender or investor interest due to industrywide or companyspecific concerns such financings could result in increased debt service expenses or dilution to our existing stockholders 

as of december 31 2016  we had 20 billion  in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities compared to 18 billion  as of december 31 2015  cash cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december 31 2016  increased primarily as the result of proceeds from the sale of certain equity method investments and cash generated from operating activities partially offset by expenditures for property plant and equipment as of december 31 2016  12 billion  of our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and were primarily based in us dollar euro and malaysian ringgit denominated holdings as of december 31 2015  15 billion  of our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and were primarily based in us dollar and euro denominated holdings 

we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed if these funds were needed for our operations in the us we could be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate such funds in november 2016 we distributed 7500 million  of cash to the us to fund capital investments associated with our transition to series 6 module manufacturing other than this distribution we intend to permanently reinvest our unremitted earnings outside of the us with the exception of canada and germany and our future plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate additional amounts to fund our domestic operations furthermore changes to foreign government banking regulations may restrict our ability to move funds among various jurisdictions under certain circumstances which could negatively impact our access to capital resulting in an adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources 

our systems business requires significant liquidity and is expected to continue to have significant liquidity requirements in the future the net amount of our project assets deferred project costs billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings and payments and billings for deferred project costs which approximates our net capital investment in the development and construction of systems projects was 11 billion  as of december 31 2016  solar power project development and construction cycles which span the time between the identification of a site location and the commercial operation of a system vary substantially and can take many years to mature as a result of these long project cycles and strategic decisions to finance the construction of certain projects we may need to make significant upfront investments of resources in advance of the receipt of any cash from the sale of such projects these upfront investments may include using our working capital project financing arrangements or availability under our revolving credit facility to finance the construction of such projects for example we may have to complete or substantially complete the construction of a systems project before such project is sold delays in construction progress or in completing the sale of our systems projects that we are selffinancing may also impact our liquidity we have historically financed these upfront systems project investments primarily using working capital in certain circumstances we may need to finance construction costs exclusively using working capital if project financing becomes unavailable due to marketwide regional or other concerns 

we are partnering with local developers on project development in markets around the world where we may take an equity stake in a project for a number of years we are also selfdeveloping projects in such markets where we may hold all or a significant portion of the equity in the projects for several years given the duration of these investments and the currency risk relative to the us dollar in some of these new markets we continue to explore local financing alternatives should these financing alternatives be unavailable or too cost prohibitive we could be exposed to significant currency risk and our liquidity could be adversely impacted 

 62 

additionally we may elect to retain an ownership interest in certain systems projects after they become operational if we determine it would be of economic and strategic benefit to do so if for example we cannot sell a systems project at economics that are attractive to us or potential customers are unwilling to assume the risks and rewards typical of pv solar power system ownership we may instead elect to temporarily own and operate such systems until we can sell the systems on economically attractive terms as with traditional electricity generation assets the selling price of a pv solar power system could be higher at or postcompletion to reflect the elimination of construction and performance risks and other uncertainties the decision to retain ownership of a system impacts liquidity depending upon the size and cost of the project as of december 31 2016  we had 4486 million  of pv solar power systems that have been placed in service primarily in international markets we may elect to enter into temporary or longterm project financing to reduce the impact on our liquidity and working capital with regards to such projects and systems we may also consider entering into tax equity or other arrangements with respect to ownership interests in certain of our projects including selling interests in our projects to the partnership described under “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – certain trends and uncertainties – 8point3 energy partners lp” which could cause a portion of the economics of such projects to be recognized over time 

the following additional considerations have impacted or may impact our liquidity in 2017  and beyond 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 63 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes the key cash flow metrics for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  in thousands 



operating activities 

the increase in cash provided by operating activities during 2016  was primarily driven by the lower volume of solar power projects under development and construction which generally require significant liquidity when such projects are financed using working capital specifically the reduction in the volume of our system business affected our trade accounts receivable project assets deferred project costs and certain current liabilities the increase in cash provided by operating activities was also driven by the sale of certain other solar power projects at or near substantial completion the decrease in cash provided by operating activities during 2015  was primarily driven by the increase in project assets and deferred project costs resulting from our financing the construction of certain projects with our working capital and increases in our trade accounts receivable 

investing activities 

the increase in cash provided by investing activities during 2016  was primarily due to proceeds from sales of equity and cost method investments of 2915 million  including the sale of our remaining interest in the desert stateline project and higher net proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities and restricted investments of 1029 million  during 2016 compared to 2031 million  of net purchases of marketable securities and restricted investments in 2015 the effects of these items were partially offset by lower distributions received from equity method investments in 2016 the decrease in cash used in investing activities during 2015  was driven by the receipt of 2390 million  from the ipo of the partnership and lower purchases of property plant and equipment the effects of these items were partially offset by net purchases of marketable securities of 2031 million  during 2015  compared to 775 million  during 2014 

financing activities 

cash used in financing activities during 2016  was mainly driven by payments of longterm debt of 1374 million  cash provided by financing activities during 2015  primarily resulted from 1460 million  of proceeds from borrowings under our project construction credit facilities in chile india and japan and 447 million  of proceeds from the leaseback financing associated with the maryland solar project partially offset by 471 million  of payments of longterm debt 

 64 

contractual obligations 

the following table presents our contractual obligations as of december 31 2016  in thousands which consists of legal commitments requiring us to make fixed or determinable cash payments we purchase raw materials for inventory manufacturing equipment construction materials and various services from a variety of vendors during the normal course of business in order to manage manufacturing and construction lead times and help assure an adequate supply of certain items we enter into agreements with suppliers that either allow us to procure goods and services when we choose or that establish purchase requirements over the term of the agreement 



 

 

 

 

 

in addition to the amounts shown in the table above we have recorded 893 million  of unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 740 income taxes  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet debt or similar obligations other than financial assurance related instruments and operating leases which are not classified as debt we do not guarantee any thirdparty debt see note 16 “commitments and contingencies”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2016  included in this annual report on form 10k for further information about our financial assurance related instruments 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 3 “recent accounting pronouncements”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2016  included in this annual report on form 10k for a summary of recent accounting pronouncements 

 65 

critical accounting estimates 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of reported assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment in the selection of the appropriate assumptions for making these estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty we base our judgments and estimates on our historical experience our forecasts and other available information as appropriate the actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results our future results of operations will be affected our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2016  included in this annual report on form 10k our critical accounting estimates which require the most significant management estimates and judgment in determining the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k are as follows 

revenue recognition – systems business  we recognize revenue for arrangements entered into by our systems business generally using two revenue recognition models following the guidance in either asc 60535 constructiontype and productiontype contracts    or asc 36020 real estate sales for arrangements which include land or land rights 

systems business sales arrangements in which we construct a pv solar power system for a specific customer on land that is controlled by the customer and has not been previously controlled by first solar are accounted for under asc 60535 for such sales arrangements we use the percentageofcompletion method as described further below using actual costs incurred over total estimated costs to develop and construct the system including module costs as our standard accounting policy 

systems business sales arrangements in which we convey control of land or land rights as part of the transaction are accounted for under asc 36020 accordingly we use one of the following revenue recognition methods based upon an evaluation of the substance and form of the terms and conditions of such real estate sales 

 

 

for any systems business sales arrangements containing multiple deliverables not required to be accounted for under asc 60535 longterm construction contracts or asc 36020 real estate sales we analyze each activity within the sales arrangement to adhere to the separation guidelines of asc 60525 for multipleelement arrangements we allocate revenue for any transactions involving multiple elements to each unit of accounting based on its relative selling price and recognize revenue for each unit of accounting when all revenue recognition criteria for a unit of accounting have been met 

our system business sales arrangements within the scope of asc 36020 involve a range of standard product warranties which include limited solar module warranties limited bos warranties and system capacity and energy performance testing each standard product warranty program represents a risk of the module manufacturer or system epc contractor and is not an obligation or risk of a system owner these programs do not represent any guarantee of energy output and relate to the underlying performance of the system assets consequently our product warranty programs do not represent any guarantees of cash flows related to the systems and we have not assumed any of the risks and rewards of ownership with respect to such programs separately our system customers may also engage us to provide om services which would typically include an effective availability guarantee our availability guarantees are an incremental offering within separate arrangements for om services availability guarantees are guarantees of our own service performance and do not represent guarantees of a system’s output or cash flows accordingly our product warranties and market based service contracts are not forms of continuing involvement that would indicate that substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership have not been transferred to the system owner 

 66 

revenue recognition – percentageofcompletion in applying the percentageofcompletion method we use the actual costs incurred relative to the total estimated costs including module costs in order to determine the progress towards completion and calculate the corresponding amount of revenue and profit to recognize costs incurred include solar modules direct materials labor subcontractor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance such as indirect labor and supplies we recognize solar module and direct material costs as incurred when such items have been installed in a system when contracts specify that title to solar modules and direct materials transfers to the customer before installation has been performed we will not recognize revenue or the associated costs until those materials are installed and have met all other revenue recognition requirements we consider solar modules and direct materials to be installed when they are permanently placed or affixed to a pv solar power system as required by engineering designs solar modules manufactured and owned by us that will be used in our systems remain within inventory until such modules are installed in a system 

the percentageofcompletion method of revenue recognition requires us to make estimates of net contract revenues and costs to complete our projects in making such estimates management judgments are required to evaluate significant assumptions including the amount of net contract revenues the cost of materials and labor expected labor productivity the impact of potential variances in schedule completion and the impact of any penalties claims change orders or performance incentives 

if estimated total costs on any contract are greater than the net contract revenues we recognize the entire estimated loss in the period the loss becomes known the cumulative effect of the revisions to estimates related to net contract revenues and costs to complete contracts including penalties claims change orders performance incentives anticipated losses and others are recorded in the period in which the revisions to estimates are identified and the amounts can be reasonably estimated the effect of the changes on future periods are recognized as if the revised estimates had been used since revenue was initially recognized under the contract such revisions could occur in any reporting period and the effects may be material depending on the size of the contracts or the changes in estimates 

accrued solar module collection and recycling liability we recognize expense at the time of sale for the estimated cost of our future obligations for collecting and recycling solar modules covered by our solar module collection and recycling program we estimate the cost of our collection and recycling obligations based on the present value of the expected probabilityweighted future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules which includes estimates for the cost of packaging materials the cost of freight from the solar module installation sites to a recycling center the material labor capital costs and scale of recycling centers and an estimated thirdparty profit margin and return on risk for collection and recycling services we base these estimates on i our experience collecting and recycling our solar modules ii the expected timing of when our solar modules will be returned for recycling and iii expected economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled in the periods between the time of sale and the related settlement of the collection and recycling obligation we accrete the carrying amount of the associated liability by applying the discount rate used for its initial measurement we periodically review our estimates of expected future recycling costs and may adjust our liability accordingly 

at december 31 2016  our estimated liability for collecting and recycling solar modules covered by our collection and recycling program was 1663 million  a 1 increase in the annualized inflation rate used in our estimated future collection and recycling cost per module would increase our liability by 375 million  and a 1 decrease in that rate would decrease our liability by 310 million  

product warranties we provide a limited pv solar module warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for generally 10  years we also typically warrant that modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 97  of their labeled power output rating during the first year with the warranty coverage reducing by 07  every year thereafter throughout the 25 year performance warranty period in resolving claims under both the limited defect and power output warranties we typically have the option of either repairing or replacing the covered modules or under the limited power output warranty providing additional modules to remedy the power shortfall we also have the option to make a payment for the thencurrent market price of modules to resolve the claims such limited module warranties are standard for module sales and may be transferred from the original purchasers of the solar modules to subsequent purchasers upon resale 

 67 

as an alternative form of our standard limited module power output warranty we also offer an aggregated or systemlevel limited module performance warranty this systemlevel limited module performance warranty is designed for utilityscale systems and provides 25 year systemlevel energy degradation protection in addition this warranty represents a practical expedient to address the challenge of identifying from the potential millions of modules installed in a utilityscale system individual modules that may be performing below warranty thresholds by focusing on the aggregate energy generated by the system rather than the power output of individual modules the systemlevel module performance warranty typically is calculated as a percentage of a system’s expected energy production adjusted for certain actual site conditions with the warranted level of performance declining each year in a linear fashion but never falling below 80  during the term of the warranty in resolving claims under the systemlevel limited module performance warranty to restore the system to warranted performance levels we first must validate that the root cause of the issue is due to module performance we then have the option of either repairing or replacing the covered modules providing supplemental modules or making a cash payment consistent with our limited module power output warranty when we elect to satisfy a warranty claim by providing replacement or supplemental modules under the systemlevel module performance warranty we do not have any obligation to pay for the labor to remove or install modules 

in addition to our limited solar module warranties described above for pv solar power systems built by us we typically provide a limited product warranty on bos parts for defects in engineering design installation and workmanship for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a system in resolving claims under such bos warranties we have the option of remedying the defect through repair or replacement 

when we recognize revenue for module or systems sales we accrue liabilities for the estimated future costs of meeting our limited warranty obligations we make and revise these estimates based primarily on the number of our solar modules under warranty installed at customer locations our historical experience with warranty claims our monitoring of field installation sites our internal testing of and the expected future performance of our solar modules and bos components and our estimated permodule replacement costs 

at december 31 2016  our accrued liabilities for product warranties was 2524 million  we estimate our limited product warranty liability for power output and defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions based on a warranty return rate of approximately 1  to 3  for modules covered under warranty as of december 31 2016  1  change in the estimated warranty return rate would change our module warranty liability by 835 million  and a 1  change in the estimated warranty return rate for bos components would not have a material impact on the associated warranty liability 

performance testing  for systems sales arrangements we also conduct performance testing of a system prior to substantial completion to confirm the system meets its operational and capacity expectations noted in the epc agreement in addition we may provide an energy performance test during the first or second year of a system’s operation to demonstrate that the actual energy generation for the applicable year meets or exceeds the modeled energy expectation after certain adjustments these tests are based on meteorological energy and equipment performance data measured at the system’s location as well as certain projections of such data over the remaining measurement period if there is an underperformance event with regards to these tests we may incur liquidated damages as a percentage of the epc contract price if necessary we accrue estimates for liquidated damages at the end of each reporting period based on our performance testing in certain instances a bonus payment may be received at the end of the first year if the system performs above a specified level 

as part of our om service offerings we typically offer an effective availability guarantee which stipulates that a system will be available to generate a certain percentage of total possible energy during a specific period after adjusting for factors outside of our control as the service provider such as weather curtailment outages force majeure and other conditions that may affect system availability effective availability guarantees are only offered as part of our om services and terminate at the end of an om arrangement these guarantees are based on meteorological energy and equipment performance data measured at the system’s location as well as certain projections of such data over the remaining measurement period if we fail to meet the contractual threshold for these guarantees we may incur liquidated damages for certain lost energy under the ppa if necessary we accrue estimates for liquidated damages at the end of each reporting period based on our effective availability calculations conversely many of our om agreements contain provisions whereby we may receive a bonus payment if system availability exceeds a separate threshold 

 68 

accounting for income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the united states and its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining our provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit we regularly evaluate the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and future examinations and we record tax liabilities as appropriate 

we establish liabilities for potential additional taxes based on our assessment of the outcome of our tax positions once established we adjust the liabilities when additional information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring an adjustment significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the actual cost of a tax assessment fine or penalty may ultimately be materially different from our recorded liabilities if any 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements we calculate our income tax expense based on our interpretation of the tax laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business this requires us to estimate our current tax obligations assess uncertain tax positions and assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 

we must also assess the likelihood that each of our deferred tax assets will be realized to the extent we believe that realization of any of our deferred tax assets is not more likely than not we establish a valuation allowance when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a reporting period we generally record a corresponding tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations conversely to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed which generally reduces our overall income tax expense 

we also consider the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and determine whether such amounts are indefinitely reinvested no additional us or nonus taxes have been accrued that may be incurred if such amounts were repatriated to the united states we have concluded that except for the earnings of our canadian and german subsidiaries and with respect to previously taxed income all such accumulated earnings are currently indefinitely reinvested or that if upon repatriation no additional us or nonus tax would be due if our intention to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries changes additional us and nonus taxes may be required to be accrued 

we continually explore initiatives to better align our tax and legal entity structure with the footprint of our nonus operations and recognize the tax impact of these initiatives including changes in the assessment of uncertain tax positions indefinite reinvestment exception assertions and the realizability of deferred tax assets in the period when we believe all necessary internal and external approvals associated with such initiatives have been obtained or when the initiatives are materially complete it is possible that the completion of one or more of these initiatives may occur within the next 12 months 

longlived asset impairment  we assess longlived assets classified as “held and used” including our property plant and equipment project assets and pv solar power systems for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances arise including consideration of technological obsolescence that may indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable and these assessments require significant judgment in determining whether such events or changes have occurred relevant considerations may include a significant decrease in the market price of a longlived asset a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a longlived asset is being used or in its physical condition a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of a longlived asset an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a longlived asset a currentperiod operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of such losses or a projection of future losses associated with the use of a longlived asset or a current expectation that more likely than not a longlived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss longlived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and we must exercise judgment in assessing such groupings and levels 

 69 

when impairment indicators are present we compare undiscounted future cash flows including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value to the asset group’s carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset group to its carrying value fair value is generally determined by considering i internally developed discounted cash flows for the asset group ii actual thirdparty valuations andor iii information available regarding the current market value for such assets if the fair value of an asset group is determined to be less than its the carrying value an impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and such projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized 

goodwill  goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the estimated fair value assigned to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed we do not amortize goodwill but instead are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually if necessary we would record any impairment in accordance with asc 350 intangibles – goodwill and other  we perform impairment tests between scheduled annual tests in the fourth quarter if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill is less than its carrying value 

  

we may first make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test the qualitative impairment test considers various factors including macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors the overall financial performance of a reporting unit and any other relevant events affecting the entity or its reporting units if we determine through the qualitative assessment that a reporting unit’s fair value is more likely than not greater than its carrying value the twostep impairment test is not required if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value we must perform the twostep impairment test we may also elect to proceed directly to the twostep impairment test without considering such qualitative factors 

the first step in a twostep impairment test is the comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill our reporting units consist of our cdte module manufacturing business and our fully integrated systems business in accordance with the authoritative guidance over fair value measurements we define the fair value of a reporting unit as the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date we primarily use the income approach methodology of valuation which includes the discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair value of our reporting units 

significant management judgment is required when estimating the fair value of our reporting units including the forecasting of future operating results and the selection of discount and expected future growth rates that we use in determining the projected cash flows if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is not impaired and no further analysis is required 

if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value in the first step then we are required to perform the second step of the impairment test in this step we assign the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in step one to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if a market participant just acquired the reporting unit in a business combination the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in the first step of the impairment test over the total amount assigned to the assets and liabilities in the second step of the impairment test represents the implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference if there is no such excess then all goodwill for a reporting unit is considered impaired 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our primary foreign currency exposures are cash flow exposure transaction exposure and earnings translation exposure 

cash flow exposure  we expect certain of our subsidiaries to have future cash flows that will be denominated in currencies other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies changes in the exchange rates between the functional currencies of our subsidiaries and the other currencies in which they transact will cause fluctuations in the cash flows we expect to receive or pay when these cash flows are realized or settled accordingly we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of these forecasted cash flows these foreign exchange forward contracts qualify for accounting as cash flow hedges in accordance with asc 815 and we designated them as such we initially report the effective portion of a derivative’s unrealized gain or loss in “ accumulated other comprehensive loss income ” and subsequently reclassify amounts into earnings when the hedged transaction occurs and impacts earnings 

 70 

our operations in malaysia pay a portion of their operating expenses such as associate wages and utilities in malaysian ringgit exposing us to foreign currency exchange risk for those malaysian ringgit expenses as we continue to expand into new markets worldwide particularly emerging markets our total foreign currency exchange risk in terms of both size and exchange rate volatility and the number of foreign currencies we are exposed to could increase significantly 

for additional details on our derivative hedging instruments and activities refer to note 10 “derivative financial instruments”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2016  included in this annual report on form 10k 

our international customers accounted for 17  of our net sales during the year ended december 31 2016  of which 2  of such sales were denominated in euros australian dollars and indian rupees  our international customers accounted for 13  of our net sales during the year ended december 31 2015  of which 40  of such sales were denominated in australian dollars our international customers accounted for 10  of our net sales during the year ended december 31 2014  of which 25  of such sales were denominated in euros as a result we have exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to our net sales fluctuations in exchange rates particularly in the us dollar to euro us dollar to australian dollar and us dollar to indian rupee may affect our gross profit and could result in foreign exchange and operating losses historically most of our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk has related to currency gains and losses between the time we sign and settle our sales contracts denominated in euros australian dollars and indian rupees for the year ended december 31 2016  a 10 change in the us dollar to euro us dollar to australian dollar or us dollar to indian rupee exchange rate would have had an aggregate impact to our net sales of 30 million  excluding the effect of our hedging activities for the year ended december 31 2015  a 10 change in the us dollar to australian dollar exchange rate would have impacted our net sales by 186 million  excluding the effect of our hedging activities for the year ended december 31 2014  a 10 change in the us dollar to euro exchange rate would have impacted our net sales by 88 million  excluding the effect of our hedging activities 

transaction exposure many of our subsidiaries have assets and liabilities primarily cash receivables marketable securities payables debt and solar module collection and recycling liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies changes in the exchange rates between the functional currencies of our subsidiaries and the other currencies in which these assets and liabilities are denominated will create fluctuations in our reported consolidated statements of operations and cash flows we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other financial instruments to economically hedge assets and liabilities against the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations the gains and losses on such foreign exchange forward contracts will economically offset all or part of the transaction gains and losses that we recognize in earnings on the related foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 

for additional details on our economic hedging instruments and activities refer to note 10 “derivative financial instruments”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2016  included in this annual report on form 10k 

if the us dollar weakened by 10 against the malaysian ringgit we would have recorded an additional 75 million  of foreign currency gains for the year ended december 31 2016  other than such malaysian ringgit exposure we did not have material transaction exposure to other foreign currencies as of december 31 2016  

earnings translation exposure  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates create volatility in our consolidated financial statements as we are required to translate the financial statements of our subsidiaries that do not have a us dollar functional currency we do not hedge translation exposure at this time but may in the future decide to purchase forward exchange contracts or other instruments to offset this impact from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

in the past such fluctuations have had an impact on our business and cash flows for example currency exchange rate fluctuations impacted our cash flows by 63 million  unfavorable 193 million  unfavorable and 195 million  unfavorable for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively although we cannot predict the impact of future foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our business or cash flows we believe that we will continue to have risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the future 

 71 

interest rate risk 

our primary interest rate risks relate to our outstanding variable rate debt our system sales prices from the effect of interest rates on our customers’ financing of such systems and our investments in marketable securities and restricted investments 

variable rate debt exposure we are exposed to interest rate risk as certain of our project construction credit facilities have variable interest rates exposing us to variability in interest expense and cash flows an increase in the tokyo interbank offered rate or equivalent variable rates would impact our cost of borrowings under our project construction credit facilities if such variable rates changed by 100 basis points our interest expense for the year ended december 31 2016  would have changed by 01 million  

customer financing exposure  we are exposed to interest rate risk because many of our systems business customers depend on debt financing to purchase a pv solar power system from us although the useful life of a pv solar power system is considered to be approximately 25 years owners of our systems must generally pay for the entire cost of the system at the time of sale as a result many of our customers rely on debt financing to fund their upfront capital expenditures an increase in interest rates available to finance such purchases could make it difficult for our customers to secure the financing necessary to purchase a system on favorable terms or at all such factors could lower demand or the price we can charge for our systems and reduce our net sales and gross profit in addition we believe that a significant percentage of our customers purchase systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt an increase in interest rates could lower an investor’s return on investment in a system or make alternative investments more attractive relative to solar power systems which in each case could cause these endusers to seek alternative investments that promise higher returns 

investments in marketable securities and restricted investments exposure  we invest in various debt securities which exposes us to interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and provide liquidity while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk accordingly a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the market value of such investments to fluctuate for example if we hold a security that was issued with an interest rate fixed at the thenprevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises the market value of our investment may decline 

to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investments in marketable securities and restricted investments we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investments assuming a 100 basis point change in interest rates during 2016  our marketable securities earned a pretax return of 1  including the impact of fluctuations in the price of the underlying securities and had a weighted average maturity of 13 months  as of december 31 2016  based on our investment positions as of december 31 2016  a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in a 62 million  change in the market value of our investment portfolio as of december 31 2016  our marketable securities were comprised of foreign debt and time deposits  during 2016  our restricted investments earned a pretax return of 13  including the impact of fluctuations in the price of the underlying securities and had a weighted average maturity of approximately 18  years as of december 31 2016  based on our investment positions as of december 31 2016  a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in a 605 million  change in the market value of our restricted investment portfolio as of december 31 2016  all of our restricted investments were in foreign and us government obligations 

commodity and component risk 

we are exposed to price risks for the raw materials components and energy costs used in the manufacturing and transportation of our solar modules and bos parts used in our pv solar power systems also some of our raw materials and components are sourced from a limited number of suppliers or a single supplier we endeavor to qualify multiple suppliers using a robust qualification process in some cases we also enter into longterm supply contracts for raw materials and components as a result we remain exposed to price changes in the raw materials and components used in our solar modules in addition the failure of a key supplier could disrupt our supply chain which could result in higher prices andor a disruption in our manufacturing or construction processes we may be unable to pass along changes in the costs of the raw materials and components for our products and systems to our customers and may be in default of our delivery obligations if we experience a manufacturing or construction disruption 

 72 

credit risk 

we have certain financial and derivative instruments that subject us to credit risk these consist primarily of cash cash equivalents marketable securities trade accounts receivable restricted cash and investments notes receivable and foreign exchange forward contracts we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial and derivative instruments we place cash cash equivalents marketable securities restricted cash and investments and foreign exchange forward contracts with various highquality financial institutions and limit the amount of credit risk from any one counterparty we continuously evaluate the credit standing of our counterparty financial institutions our net sales are primarily concentrated among a limited number of customers we monitor the financial condition of our customers and perform credit evaluations whenever considered necessary depending upon the sales arrangement we may require some form of payment security from our customers including parent guarantees bank guarantees or commercial letters of credit

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain “disclosure controls and procedures” as such term is defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that disclosure controls and procedures no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met additionally in designing disclosure controls and procedures our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures the design of any disclosure controls and procedures is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 

based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of that date 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate “internal control over financial reporting” as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016  based on the criteria established in internal control – integrated framework 2013  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 

based on the results of our evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2016  the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2016  has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in its report which appears herein 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of our “internal control over financial reporting” as defined in exchange act rule 13a15f and rule 15d15f to determine whether any changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the year ended december 31 2016  that materially affected or are reasonably likely to material affect our internal control over financial reporting 

based on that evaluation there were no such changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2016  that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

 74 

inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud control systems no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control systems’ objectives are being met further the design of any control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of all controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within our company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of error or mistake control systems can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any control system is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

market overview 

solar energy is a growing form of renewable energy with numerous economic and environmental benefits that make it an attractive complement to andor substitute for traditional forms of electricity generation in recent years the price of pv solar power systems and accordingly the cost of producing electricity from such systems has dropped to levels that are competitive with or even below the retail price of electricity in many markets the rapid price decline that pv solar energy has experienced in recent years opens new possibilities to develop systems in some locations with limited or no financial incentives the fact that a pv solar power system requires no fuel provides a unique and valuable hedging benefit to owners of such systems relative to traditional electricity generation assets once installed pv solar power systems can function for 25 or more years with relatively less maintenance or oversight compared to traditional forms of electricity generation in addition to these economic benefits pv solar has several environmental benefits for example pv solar power systems do not generate any greenhouse gas or other emissions and use no or minimal amounts of water compared to traditional forms of electricity generation solar markets worldwide continue to develop aided by the above factors as well as demand elasticity resulting from declining industry average selling prices both at the module and system level which make solar power more affordable to new markets and we have continued to develop our localized presence and expertise in such markets 

the solar industry continues to be characterized by intense pricing competition both at the module and system levels in the aggregate we believe manufacturers of solar modules and cells have relative to global demand significant installed production capacity and the ability for additional capacity expansion we believe the solar industry may from time to time experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity exceeds global demand and that such periods will put pressure on pricing additionally intense competition at the systems level can result in an environment in which pricing falls rapidly thereby further increasing demand for solar energy solutions but constraining the ability for project developers engineering procurement and construction “epc” companies and verticallyintegrated solar companies such as first solar to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability in light of such market realities we are executing our long term strategic plan vision 2020 “long term strategic plan” described below under which we are focusing on our competitive strengths such strengths include our advanced module and system technologies as well as our differentiated verticallyintegrated business model that enables us to provide utilityscale pv solar energy solutions to key geographic markets with immediate electricity needs 

strategy and competitive strengths 

to build upon our industry leading position and to remain one of the preferred providers of pv solar energy solutions we are pursuing the following strategies differentiation sustainable growth and financial viability 

differentiation

“ppa” throughout the operational life of the plants we have made significant investments in om technologies in order to develop and create a scalable and sustainable om platform our om program is compliant with the north american electric reliability corporation “nerc” standards and is designed to be scalable to accommodate the growing om needs of customers worldwide we believe our om expertise is a significant differentiator as it is difficult for many competitors to replicate this experience 

 

sustainable growth 

in executing our long term strategic plan we are focusing on providing pv solar energy solutions using our modules to key geographic markets that we believe have a compelling need for massscale pv electricity including markets throughout the americas asia the middle east and africa as part of our long term strategic plan we are focusing on opportunities in which our pv solar energy solutions can compete directly with fossil fuel offerings on an lcoe or similar basis or complement such fossil fuel electricity offerings execution of the long term strategic plan entails a prioritization of market opportunities worldwide relative to our core strengths and a corresponding allocation of resources around the globe this prioritization involves a focus on our core utilityscale offerings and exists within a current market environment that includes rooftop and distributed generation solar particularly in the us while it is unclear how rooftop and distributed generation solar might impact our core utilityscale offerings in the next several years we believe that utilityscale solar will continue to be a compelling solar offering for companies with technology and cost leadership and will continue to represent an increasing portion of the overall electricity generation mix 

we are closely evaluating and managing the appropriate level of resources required as we pursue the most advantageous and cost effective projects and partnerships in our target markets we have dedicated and intend to continue to dedicate significant capital and human resources to reduce the total installed cost of pv solar energy to optimize the design and logistics around our pv solar energy solutions and to ensure that our solutions integrate well into the overall electricity ecosystem of each specific market we expect that over time an increasing portion of our consolidated net sales operating income and cash flows may come from solar offerings in the key geographic markets described above as we execute on our long term strategic plan the timing execution and financial impacts of our long term strategic plan are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in item 1a “risk factors” we are focusing our resources in those markets and energy applications in which solar power can be a leastcost bestfit energy solution particularly in regions with high solar resources significant current or projected electricity demand andor relatively high existing electricity prices as part of these efforts we continue to expand or reallocate resources globally including business development sales personnel and other supporting professional staff in target markets accordingly we may shift current costs or incur additional costs over time as we establish a localized business presence in these target markets 

joint ventures or other strategic arrangements with partners are a key part of our long term strategic plan and we generally use such arrangements to expedite our penetration of various key markets and establish relationships with potential customers we also enter into joint ventures or strategic arrangements with customers or other entities to maximize the value of particular projects some of these arrangements involve and are expected in the future to involve significant investments or other allocations of capital we continue to develop relationships with policymakers regulators and end customers in these strategic markets with a view to creating opportunities for utilityscale pv solar power systems we sell such systems directly to end customers including utilities independent power producers commercial and industrial companies and other system owners depending on the market opportunity our sales offerings may range from moduleonly sales to module sales with a range of development epc services and other solutions to full turnkey pv solar power system sales we expect these offerings to continue to evolve over time as we work with our customers to optimize how our pv solar energy solutions can best meet our customers’ energy and economic needs 

financial viability 

first solar’s commitment is to create longterm shareholder value and generate returns on invested capital in excess of its weighted average cost of capital over that time horizon despite substantial downward pressure on the price of solar modules due to pricing competition and significant capacity in the industry we have continued to deliver strong financial performance and liquidity as planned we expect to continue to drive operating expense efficiencies and improvements while still investing in growth the continued development of our global sales capabilities and our rd roadmap we seek to balance our incentive compensation and decisionmaking processes to ensure we direct our efforts and investments towards longterm profitable and sustainable growth with appropriate returns on invested capital and reinvest excess returns back into the business

jordan and egypt have actively facilitated the development of the independent power production sector in their countries as a means of responding to urgent energy needs for example jordan has committed to installing 600  mw of pv solar capacity by 2020  while egypt has progressed in its oversubscribed multigigawatt solar tender in the rest of the arabian gulf the region’s stateowned hydrocarbon companies are becoming more involved in regional solar programs examples include initiatives spearheaded by saudi aramco petroleum development oman and the kuwait oil company however as with any emerging market challenges remain and these are primarily related to evolving policy and legislation prevailing energy subsidies infrastructure the availability of financing the level of competition and geopolitical risk 

  

since establishing a presence in the middle east in 2013  first solar has focused on the region’s utilityscale segment while pursuing a range of opportunities in addition to constructing the 13  mw dc first phase of the mohammed bin rashid al maktoum solar park in dubai first solar will also be supplying the modules for the park’s 200  mw ac second phase in jordan first solar is constructing the 53  mw ac shams ma’an pv solar power system which is expected to account for approximately 1  of jordan’s annual energy output upon completion in 2016  additionally first solar has provisionally been allocated 50  mw in egypt’s feedintariff program as a result of these and other projects first solar expects to be the leading provider of pv solutions in the middle east with a projected installed capacity of at least 271  mw across the region by 2017

in 2015  we secured rights through a competitive auction to sell power under a 25 year ppa for a cumulative capacity of 75  mw ac to the state owned electricity distribution companies in telangana we also have 125  mw ac of existing projects for which ppas were secured in 2014  in 2015  we successfully achieved commercial operation of 20  mw ac of our project pipeline and commenced development or construction on 180  mw ac of the remaining pipeline which is expected to achieve commercial operation during 2016  we continue to maintain our pv module market leadership in india with over 1000  mw dc of installed modules 

 

support programs 

although our long term strategic plan provides for first solar to compete in key markets that do not require solarspecific government subsidies or support programs in the near term our net sales and profits remain subject to variability based on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives support programs for pv solar electricity generation depending on the jurisdiction include fits quotas including renewable portfolio standards and tendering systems and net energy metering programs in addition to these support programs financial incentives for pv solar electricity generation include tax incentives grants loans rebates and production incentives although we expect to become less impacted by and less dependent on support programs as we execute our long term strategic plan support programs will continue to play varying roles in accelerating the adoption of pv solar systems around the world 

in europe renewable energy targets in conjunction with fits renewable obligation certificates and other schemes such as tenders for utilityscale pv solar have contributed to the growth in pv solar markets renewable energy targets prescribe how much energy consumption must come from renewable sources while incentive policies and competitive tender policies are intended to support new supply development by providing certainty to investors a 2009  european union “eu” directive on renewable energy which replaced an earlier 2001  directive sets varying targets for all eu member states in support of the directive’s goal of a 20  share of energy from renewable sources in the eu by 2020  and requires national action plans that establish clear pathways for the development of renewable energy sources 

tax incentive programs exist in the us at both the federal and state level and can take the form of investment and production tax credits accelerated depreciation and sales and property tax exemptions and abatements at the federal level investment tax credits for business and residential solar systems have gone through several cycles of enactment and expiration since the 1980’s in december 2015  the us congress extended the 30  federal energy investment tax credit “itc” for both residential and commercial solar installations through december 31 2019  the credit will step down to 26 in 2020 22 in 2021 and remain at 10  permanently beginning in 2022  the itc has been an important economic driver of solar installations in the us and its extension is expected to contribute to greater mediumterm demand visibility in the us the positive impact of the itc has depended to a large degree on the availability of tax equity for project financing and any significant reduction in the availability of tax equity in the future could make it more difficult to develop and construct projects requiring financing the eventual stepdown of the itc to 10  underscores the need for the lcoe from solar systems to continue to decline and remain competitive with other sources of energy generation 

at the federal level the environmental protection agency’s adoption of a final clean power plan rule the “rule” and implementation of the rule through state plans offered the possibility of increasing the demand for pv solar generating capacity in certain regions of the us in which pv solar has not historically received significant statelevel policy support however the adoption and implementation of the rule has been impacted by litigation against the rule initiated by states and other stakeholders which has not yet been resolved and in february 2016 the us supreme court stayed implementation of the rule while such legal challenges are pending it is therefore premature to assess what the effects of the rule will be on pv solar markets 

the majority of states in the us have enacted legislation adopting renewable portfolio standard “rps” mechanisms under an rps regulated utilities and other load serving entities are required to procure a specified percentage of their total electricity sales to enduser customers from eligible renewable resources such as solar generating facilities by a specified date some programs may further require that a specified portion of the total percentage of renewable energy must come from solar generating facilities rps legislation and implementing regulations vary significantly from state to state particularly with respect to the percentage of renewable energy required to achieve the state’s rps the definition of eligible renewable energy resources and the extent to which renewable energy credits certificates representing the generation of renewable energy qualify for rps compliance measured in terms of the volume of renewable electricity required to meet its rps mandate california’s rps program is the most significant in the us and the california market for renewable energy has dominated the western us region for the 

 10 

past several years first enacted in 2002  california’s rps statute has been amended several times to increase the overall percentage requirement as well as to accelerate the target date for program compliance pursuant to amendments enacted by the california legislature in 2015  the california rps program now requires utilities and other obligated load serving entities to procure 50  of their retail electricity demand from eligible renewable resources by 2030  in 2015  approximately 60  of our total net sales were derived from our systems projects or thirdparty module sales to solar power systems in california

see note 23   “segment and geographical information ”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2015  included in this annual report on form 10k for further information on our business segments 

components business 

our components business involves the design manufacture and sale of solar modules which convert sunlight into electricity 

solar modules 

cdte modules  our flagship module since the inception of first solar has been manufactured using our advanced cdte thinfilm technology each solar module is a glass laminate approximately 2ft x 4ft 60cm x 120cm in size that encapsulates a cdte thinfilm semiconductor our solar modules had an average rated power per module of approximately 107 watts  95 watts  and 91 watts  for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively during 2014 we announced the release of our series 4 tm  module which offers up to 8  more energy than conventional crystalline silicon modules with the same efficiency rating and is compatible with advanced 1500volt plant architectures the series 4a tm  variant features a new antireflective coated glass which enhances energy production our semiconductor structure is a singlejunction polycrystalline thinfilm that uses cdte as the absorption layer cdte has absorption properties that are matched to the solar spectrum and can deliver competitive conversion efficiencies using approximately 12 of the amount of semiconductor material that is used to manufacture traditional crystalline silicon solar modules one of the drivers of first solar modules’ performance advantage over traditional crystalline silicon modules is a lower temperature coefficient delivering higher energy yields at elevated operating temperatures typical of utilityscale solar power plants in sunny regions 

crystalline silicon modules  in addition to our primary cdte module technology we also manufacture crystalline silicon modules made from highefficiency ntype mono cells produced at our facility in kulim malaysia and then assembled into a 60 or 72 cell module by thirdparty contract manufacturers when fully ramped we expect the facility to have the capacity to produce 55000 156mm cells per day for a nameplate capacity of 100 mw annually the standard first solar 60 cell pv module will have a power rating of 300 watts accordingly our crystalline silicon technology is expected to deliver a very high efficient cell at a much lower manufacturing cost than is currently available in the marketplace 

descriptions below of our components business relate to our cdte modules unless otherwise noted 

manufacturing process 

cdte modules we manufacture our cdte solar modules on highthroughput integrated production lines in an automated proprietary and continuous process our solar modules employ a thin layer of semiconductor material to convert sunlight into electricity our manufacturing process eliminates the multiple supply chain operators and expensive and timeconsuming batch processing steps that are used to produce crystalline silicon solar modules currently we manufacture our solar modules at our perrysburg ohio and kulim malaysia manufacturing facilities 

 11 

we have integrated our cdte manufacturing processes into a continuous production line with the following three stages the deposition stage the cell definition and treatment stage and the assembly and test stage in the deposition stage panels of transparent oxidecoated glass are robotically loaded onto the production line where they are cleaned laser etch identified with a serial number heated and coated with thin layers of cdte and other semiconductor materials using our proprietary vapor transport deposition technology after which the semiconductorcoated plates are cooled rapidly to increase strength in the cell definition and treatment stage we use high speed lasers to transform the large single semiconductor coating on the glass plate into a series of interconnected cells that deliver the desired current and voltage output in this stage we also treat the semiconductor film using proprietary chemistries and processes to improve the device performance and we apply a metal terminated sputtered back contact finally in the assembly and test stage we apply busbars interlayer material and a rear glass cover sheet that is laminated to encapsulate the device a junction box and termination wires are then applied to complete the assembly the final assembly stage is the only stage in our production line that requires manual processing 

we maintain a robust quality and reliability assurance program that monitors critical process parameters and measures product performance to ensure that industry and internal standards are met acceptance testing for both electrical leakage and power measurement on a solar simulator are conducted prior to a module being boxed for shipment the quality and reliability tests complement production surveillance with an ongoing monitoring program subjecting production modules to accelerated life stress testing to help ensure ongoing conformance to requirements of the international electrotechnical commission “iec” and underwriters laboratories inc “ul” these programs assure a high level of product quality and reliability helping to deliver power performance in the field 

crystalline silicon modules we manufacture our crystalline silicon cells at our facility in kulim malaysia the manufacturing process starts with 156mm  ntype monocrystalline silicon wafers supplied by a variety of wafer suppliers incoming wafers are subjected to a series of inspections to ensure that high quality standards are met the proprietary manufacturing process consists of passivation annealing metalization printing wet cleans and electroplating steps and are all fully automated independent steps completed cells are tested and binned according to strict performance criteria the final module assembly is completed by a contract manufacturing company that performs manufacturing to our module specifications using a bill of materials managed by us 

we maintain a robust quality and reliability assurance program that monitors critical process parameters to ensure that industry and internal standards are met this rigorous set of evaluations is conducted prior to each solar module undergoing acceptance testing for both electrical leakage and power measurement on a solar simulator the quality and reliability tests complement production surveillance with an ongoing monitoring program subjecting production modules to accelerated life cycle and stress testing to ensure conformance to iec and ul requirements this program assures a high level of product quality and reliability helping to predict power performance in the field 

research development and engineering 

we continue to devote substantial resources to research and development with the primary objective of lowering the lifecycle cost of electricity generated by our pv solar power systems we conduct our research and development activities primarily in the united states within our components business we focus our research and development activities on among other areas continuing to increase the conversion efficiency and energy yield of our solar modules and continuously improving durability and manufacturing efficiencies including throughput improvement volume ramp and material cost reduction 

in the course of our research and development activities we continuously explore and research technologies in our efforts to sustain competitive differentiation in our modules we typically qualify process and product improvements for full production at our perrysburg ohio plant and then use a systematic process to propagate them to our other production lines we believe that our systematic approach to technology change management will provide continuous improvements and ensure uniform adoption across our production lines in addition our cdte production lines are replicas or near replicas of each other and as a result a process or production improvement on one line can be rapidly and reliably deployed to other production lines 

we regularly produce research cells in our laboratories some of which are tested for performance and certified by independent labs such as the national renewable energy laboratory cell efficiency measures the proportion of light converted in a single solar cell at standard test conditions our research cells are produced using laboratory equipment and methods and are not intended to be representative of our manufacturing capability we believe that our record cells demonstrate a potential longterm module efficiency entitlement of over 19  using our commercialscale manufacturing equipment 

 12 

in 2013  we acquired ge’s global cdte solar intellectual property portfolio setting a course for significant advancement of our pv thinfilm solar technology the combination of the two companies’ complementary technologies and first solar’s existing manufacturing capabilities have accelerated the development of cdte solar module performance and improved efficiency at a manufacturing scale in addition ge global research and first solar rd are collaborating on future technology development to further advance cdte solar technology pursuant to an agreement through 2016  

for information regarding our research and development expense for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – results of operations” 

customers 

  

with respect to our components business during 2015  we sold the majority of our solar modules not included in our systems projects to integrators and operators of systems in india and great britain thirdparty module sales represented approximately 6  of our total 2015  net sales additionally we develop design construct and sell pv solar power systems that use the solar modules we manufacture 

during 2015  southern power company  strata solar llc  and nextera energy inc  individually accounted for more than 10  of our components segment’s net sales which includes the solar modules used in our systems projects we are investing in key geographic markets particularly in areas with abundant solar resources and sizable electricity demand and as part of such efforts we are seeking to develop additional customer relationships which has reduced and is expected to continue to reduce our customer and geographic concentration and dependence 

competition 

the renewable energy solar energy and solar module sectors are highly competitive and continually evolving as participants in these sectors strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete within the larger electric power industry we face intense competition for sales of solar modules which has resulted in and may continue to result in reduced margins and loss of market share with respect to our components business our primary sources of competition are currently crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers as well as other thinfilm module manufacturers certain of our existing or future competitors may be part of larger corporations that have greater financial resources and greater brand name recognition than we do and as a result may be better positioned to adapt to changes in the industry or the economy as a whole certain competitors may have direct or indirect access to sovereign capital which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time among pv module and cell manufacturers the principal methods of competition include sales price per watt conversion efficiency energy yield reliability warranty terms and customer payment terms if competitors reduce module pricing to levels near or below their manufacturing costs or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time our results of operations could be adversely affected at december 31 2015  the global pv industry consisted of more than 150  manufacturers of solar modules and cells in the aggregate these manufacturers have relative to global demand significant installed production capacity and the ability for additional capacity expansion we believe the solar industry may from time to time experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity exceeds global demand and that such periods will put pressure on pricing which could adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition we expect to compete with future entrants into the pv solar industry that offer new technological solutions we also face competition from semiconductor manufacturers and semiconductor equipment manufacturers or their customers that produce pv solar cells solar modules or turnkey production lines we also face competition from companies that currently offer or are developing other renewable energy technologies including wind hydropower geothermal biomass and tidal technologies and other power generation sources that employ conventional fossil fuels 

raw materials 

our cdte module manufacturing process uses approximately 30 types of raw materials and components to construct a complete solar module one critical raw material in our production process is cadmium telluride of the other raw materials and components the following are also critical to our manufacturing process front glass coated with transparent conductive oxide other semiconductor materials organics such as photo resist tempered back glass packaging components such as interlayer cord platecord plate cap junction box lead wire and solar connectors before we use these materials and components in our manufacturing process a supplier must undergo a rigorous qualification process we continually evaluate new suppliers and currently are qualifying several new suppliers and materials when possible we attempt to use suppliers that can provide a raw material supply source that is near our manufacturing locations reducing the cost and lead times for such materials a few of our critical materials or components are single sourced and most others are supplied by a limited number of suppliers 

 13 

cdte solar module collection and recycling program 

first solar is committed to extended producer responsibility and takes into account the environmental impact of its products over their entire life cycle we established the solar industry’s first comprehensive module collection and recycling program first solar’s module recycling process is designed to enable the recovery of valuable materials including the glass and encapsulated semiconductor material for use in new modules or other new products and minimizes the environmental impacts associated with our modules at the end of their useful lives approximately 90 of each collected first solar module can be recycled into materials for use in new products including new solar modules 

first solar’s recycling services provide plant owners with flexibility in determining endoflife module disposition for modules sold under sales arrangements covered under our solar module collection and recycling program “the program” we include a description of our module collection and recycling obligations for such modules covered under the program we agree to cover the costs for the collection and recycling of solar modules and the endusers agree to notify us disassemble their systems package the solar modules for shipment and revert module ownership rights back to us at the end of the modules’ service lives 

the european union’s waste electronics and electrical equipment “weee” directive places the obligation of recycling including collection treatment and environmentally sound disposal of electrical and electronic equipment “eee” products upon producers the weee directive is now applicable to pv solar modules in eu member states for modules covered under our prefunded program that were previously sold into and installed in the eu we continue to maintain a commitment to cover the estimated collection and recycling costs consistent with our historical program in addition as a result of the transposition of the weee directive by the eu member states we will be adjusting our offering in the various eu member states as required to ensure compliance with specific eu member state weee regulations 

in addition to achieving substantial environmental benefits our solar module collection and recycling program may provide us the opportunity to recover certain raw materials and components for reuse in our manufacturing process we currently have recycling facilities operating at each of our current manufacturing facilities in the us and malaysia and at our former manufacturing facility location in germany that produce glass cullet suitable for use in the production of new glass products by a thirdparty supplier and unrefined semiconductor materials that will be further processed by a thirdparty supplier and then used to produce semiconductor materials for use in new solar modules 

solar module warranties 

we provide a limited pv solar module warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for 10  years following the transfer of title to our modules we also typically warrant that modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 97  of their labeled power output rating during the first year with the warranty coverage reducing by 07  every year thereafter throughout the 25 year performance warranty period prior to 2014  we warranted that modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications would produce at least 90  of their labeled power output rating during the first 10  years following installation and at least 80  of their labeled power output rating during the following 15  years in resolving claims under both the defect and power output warranties we have the option of either repairing or replacing the covered modules or under the power output warranty providing additional modules to remedy the power shortfall we also have the option to make a payment for the then current market price of modules to resolve the claims such limited module warranties are standard for module sales and are automatically transferred from the original purchasers of the solar modules to subsequent purchasers upon resale 

as an alternative form of our standard limited module power output warranty we also offer an aggregated or system level limited module performance warranty this system level limited module performance warranty is designed for utilityscale systems and provides 25 year system level energy degradation protection in addition this warranty represents a practical expedient to address the challenge of identifying from the potential millions of modules installed in a utilityscale system individual modules that may be performing below warranty thresholds by focusing on the aggregate energy generated by the system rather than the power output of individual modules the system level limited module performance warranty typically is calculated as a percentage of a system’s expected energy production adjusted for certain actual site conditions with the warranted level of performance declining each year in a linear fashion but never falling below 80  during the term of the warranty in resolving claims under the system level limited module performance warranty to restore the system to warranted performance levels we first must validate that the root cause of the issue is due to module performance we then have the option of either repairing or replacing the covered modules providing supplemental modules or making a cash payment consistent with our limited module power output warranty when we elect to satisfy a warranty claim by providing replacement or supplemental modules under the system level module performance warranty we do not have any obligation to pay for the labor to remove or install modules 

 14 

from time to time we have taken remediation actions with respect to affected modules beyond our limited warranty and we may elect to do so in the future in which case we would incur additional expenses such potential voluntary future remediation actions beyond our limited warranty obligation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations if we commit to any such remediation actions 

systems business 

through our fully integrated systems business we provide complete turnkey pv solar power systems or solar solutions which may include project development epc services andor om services 

project development 

project development activities include site selection and securing rights to acquire or use the site obtaining the requisite interconnection and transmission studies executing an interconnection agreement obtaining environmental and landuse permits maintaining effective site control and entering into a ppa with an offtaker of the power to be generated by the project these activities culminate in receiving the right to construct and operate a pv solar power system depending on the market opportunity or geographic location we may acquire projects in various stages of development or acquire project companies from developers in order to complete the development process construct a system incorporating our modules and sell the system to a longterm owner we may also collaborate with local partners in connection with these project development activities depending on the type of project or geographic location ppas or fit structures define the price and terms the utility customer or investor will pay for power produced from the project entering into a ppa generally provides the underlying economics needed to finalize development including permitting beginning construction arranging financing and marketing the project for sale to a longterm owner depending primarily on the location stage of development upon our acquisition of the project and other site attributes the development cycle typically ranges from one to two years but can be as long as five years we may be required to incur significant costs for preliminary engineering permitting legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built if there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals we may be forced to incur additional costs writedown capitalized project assets and the right of the offtaker under the ppa to terminate may be triggered 

epc services 

epc services include engineering design and related services bos procurement advanced development of grid integration solutions and construction contracting and management we provide the majority of our epc services to our selfdeveloped projects intended to be sold however we also provide epc services to projects developed by independent solar power project developers and directly to system owners such as utilities depending on the customer and market need we may provide our full epc services or any combination of individual products and services within our epc capabilities 

for pv solar power systems built by us we typically provide a limited product warranty on bos parts for defects in engineering design installation and workmanship for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a system in resolving claims under such bos warranties we have the option of remedying the defect through repair or replacement 

as part of our systems business we conduct performance testing of a system prior to substantial completion to confirm the system meets its operational and capacity expectations noted in the epc agreement in addition we may provide an energy performance test during the first year of a system’s operation such a test is designed to demonstrate that the actual energy generation for the first year meets or exceeds the modeled energy expectation after certain adjustments these adjustments include factors such as irradiance weather module degradation soiling curtailment and other conditions that may affect a system’s energy output but are unrelated to the quality design or construction 

 15 

om services 

our typical om service arrangements involve the performance of standard activities associated with operating and maintaining a pv solar power system we perform such activities pursuant to the scope of services outlined in the underlying contract these activities are considered necessary to optimize system performance and comply with ppas other agreements and regulations although the scope of our services may vary by contract our om service arrangements generally include 247 system monitoring certain ppa and other agreement compliance north american electric reliability corporation compliance large generator interconnection agreement compliance energy forecasting performance engineering analysis regular performance reporting turnkey maintenance services including spare parts and corrective maintenance repair warranty management and environmental services as part of our om services we also typically provide an effective availability guarantee which stipulates that a system will be available to generate a certain percentage of total possible energy during a specific period after adjusting for factors outside of our control as the service provider such as weather curtailment outages force majeure and other conditions that may affect system availability 

customers 

with respect to our systems business our customers consist of utilities independent power producers commercial and industrial companies and other system owners these customers may purchase completed pv solar power systems which include our solar modules or any combination of development epc services and om services during 2015  the substantial majority of our systems business sales were in north america and the principal customers of our systems business were nextera energy inc  and southern power company  each of which also accounted for more than 10  of the segment’s net sales 

competition 

with respect to our systems business we face competition from other providers of renewable energy solutions including developers of pv solar power systems and developers of other forms of renewable energy projects including wind hydropower geothermal biomass and tidal projects to the extent other solar module manufacturers become more vertically integrated we expect to face increased competition from such companies as well we also face competition from other epc companies and joint venture type arrangements between epc companies and solar companies certain current or potential future competitors may also have a low cost of capital andor access to foreign capital while the decline in pv module prices over the last several years has increased interest in solar electricity worldwide there are limited barriers of entry in many parts of the pv solar value chain depending on the geographic market accordingly competition at the systems level can be intense thereby exerting downward pressure on systems level profit margins industrywide to the extent competitors are willing and able to bid aggressively low prices for new projects and ppas using low cost assumptions for modules bos components installation maintenance and other costs please see item 1a “risk factors – competition at the systems level can be intense thereby potentially exerting downward pressure on systems level profit margins industrywide which could reduce our profitability and adversely affect our results of operations ” 

research development and engineering 

our systems business research and development activities are primarily focused on the objective of lowering the lcoe through reductions in bos costs improved system design and energy yield enhancements associated with pv solar power systems that use our modules these rd efforts are also focused on continuing to improve our systems in terms of grid reliability we conduct our research and development activities for the systems business primarily in the united states innovations related to system design hardware platforms inverters trackers and installation techniques and knowhow among other things can and are expected in the future to continue to reduce bos costs which can represent a significant portion of the costs associated with the construction of a typical utilityscale pv solar power system 

for information regarding our research and development expense for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – results of operations” 

own and operate 

from time to time we may temporarily own and operate certain pv solar power systems often with the intention to sell at a later date the ability to do so allows us to gain control of the sales process provide a lower risk profile to a future buyer of a system and improve our ability to drive higher eventual sale values as of december 31 2015  we owned and operated a number of systems in various geographic markets as an owner and operator for certain of these systems we may be subject to the authority of the federal energy regulatory commission “ferc” as well as various other local state and federal regulatory bodies for more information about risks related to owning and operating pv solar power systems please see item 1a “risk factors – as an 

 16 

owner and operator of pv solar power systems that deliver electricity to the grid certain of our affiliated entities may be regulated as public utilities under us federal and state law which could adversely affect the cost of doing business and limit our growth ” for more information about the economics of such ownership and the impacts on our liquidity see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources” 

intellectual property 

our success depends in part on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technology and to conduct our business without infringing on the proprietary rights of others we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks and trade secrets as well as associate and thirdparty confidentiality agreements to safeguard our intellectual property we regularly file patent applications to protect inventions arising from our research and development and are currently pursuing patent applications in the us and other countries our patent applications and any future patent applications might not result in a patent being issued with the scope of the claims we seek or at all and any patents we may receive may be challenged invalidated or declared unenforceable in addition we have registered andor have applied to register trademarks and service marks in the us and a number of foreign countries for “first solar” and “first solar and design” 

with respect to proprietary knowhow that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce we rely on among other things trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests we believe that many elements of our pv module manufacturing process including our unique materials sourcing involve proprietary knowhow technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications including technical processes equipment designs algorithms and procedures we have taken security measures to protect these elements our research and development personnel have entered into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us these agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our associates to assign to us all of the inventions designs and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us we also require our customers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our modules technology or business plans 

we have not been subject to any material intellectual property infringement or misappropriation claims 

environmental health and safety matters 

our operations include the use handling storage transportation generation and disposal of hazardous materials and hazardous wastes we are subject to various national state local and international laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the use management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes occupational health and safety and the cleanup of contaminated sites therefore we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions and costs arising from thirdparty property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations or noncompliance with environmental permits required for our operations we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety requirements and do not expect to incur material expenditures for environmental and occupational health and safety controls in the foreseeable future however future developments such as the implementation of new more stringent laws and regulations more aggressive enforcement policies or the discovery of unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations see item 1a “risk factors – environmental obligations and liabilities could have a substantial negative impact on our financial condition cash flows and profitability ”

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the following information together with the other information in this annual report on form 10k before buying shares of our stock if any of the following risks or uncertainties occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our stock could decline 

  

risks related to our markets and customers 

competition at the systems level can be intense thereby potentially exerting downward pressure on systems level profit margins industrywide which could reduce our profitability and adversely affect our results of operations   

the significant decline in pv module prices over the last several years continues to create a challenging environment for module manufacturers but it has also increased interest in solar electricity worldwide by eroding one of the primary historical constraints to widespread solar market penetration namely its affordability aided by such lower module prices competitors have in many cases been willing and able to bid aggressively for new projects and ppas using low cost assumptions for modules bos components installation maintenance and other costs as the basis for such bids relatively low barriers to entry for competitors have led to depending on the market and other factors intense competition at the systems level intense competition at the systems level can result in an environment in which systems level pricing falls rapidly thereby further increasing demand for solar solutions but constraining the ability for project developers epc companies andor verticallyintegrated solar companies such as first solar to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability accordingly while we believe our systems offerings and experience are positively differentiated in many cases from that of our competitors we may fail to correctly identify our competitive position we may be unable to develop or maintain a sufficient magnitude of new systems projects worldwide at economically attractive rates of return and we may not otherwise be able to achieve meaningful profitability under our long term strategic plan 

depending on the market opportunity we may be at a disadvantage compared to potential systemslevel competitors for example certain of our competitors may have a stronger andor more established localized business presence in a particular geographic region certain of our competitors may be larger entities that have greater financial resources and greater overall brand name recognition than we do and as a result may be better positioned to impact customer behavior or adapt to changes in the industry or the economy as a whole certain competitors may also have direct or indirect access to sovereign capital andor other incentives which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time 

additionally largescale solar systems are still in their relatively early stages of existence and depending on the geographic area certain potential customers may still be in the process of educating themselves about the points of differentiation among various available providers of pv solar solutions including a company’s proven overall experience and bankability system design and optimization expertise grid interconnection and stabilization expertise and proven om capabilities if we are unable over time to meaningfully differentiate our offerings at scale from the viewpoint of our potential customer base our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may continue to cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations   

in the aggregate solar manufacturers have relative to global demand significant installed production capacity and the ability for additional capacity expansion we believe the solar industry may from time to time experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity exceeds global demand and that such periods will put pressure on pricing during the past several years industry average sales prices per watt “asps” have declined at times significantly both at the module and system levels as competitors have reduced asps to sellthrough inventories worldwide if our competitors reduce module pricing to levels near or below their manufacturing costs or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time or if demand for pv modules does not grow sufficiently to justify the current production supply our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

if pv technology is not suitable for widespread adoption at economically attractive rates of return or if sufficient additional demand for solar modules and systems does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate our net sales and profit may flatten or decline and we may be unable to sustain profitability 

in comparison to fossil fuelbased electricity generation the solar energy market is at a relatively early stage of development if pv technology proves unsuitable for widespread adoption at economically attractive rates of return or if additional demand for solar modules and systems fails to develop sufficiently or takes longer to develop than we anticipate we may be unable to grow 

 21 

our business or generate sufficient net sales to sustain profitability in addition demand for solar modules and systems in our targeted markets may develop to a lesser extent than we anticipate many factors may affect the viability of widespread adoption of pv technology and demand for solar modules and systems including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives renewable energy targets and other support for ongrid solar electricity applications or an increase in protectionist or other adverse public policies could reduce demand andor price levels for our solar modules and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales thereby adversely impacting our operating results  

although our long term strategic plan provides for first solar to transition over time toward operating in key geographic markets that do not require solarspecific government subsidies or support programs and we believe that solar will experience widespread adoption in those applications where it competes economically with traditional forms of energy without any support programs in the nearterm our net sales and profit remain subject to variability based on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives federal state and local governmental bodies in many countries have provided subsidies in the form of fits rebates tax incentives and other incentives to endusers distributors systems integrators and manufacturers of pv products many of these support programs expire phase out over time require renewal by the applicable authority or may be amended a summary of recent developments in the major government support programs that can impact our business appears under item 1 “business – support programs” to the extent these support programs are reduced earlier than previously expected or are changed retroactively or freefield or conversion land applications are disadvantaged such changes could reduce demand andor price levels for our solar modules and systems lead to a reduction in our net sales and adversely impact our operating results another consideration in the us market and to a lesser extent in other global markets is the effect of governmental landuse planning policies and environmental policies on utilityscale pv solar development the adoption of restrictive landuse designations or environmental regulations which proscribe or restrict the siting of utilityscale solar facilities could adversely affect the marginal cost of such development these examples show that established markets for pv solar development such as the us market face uncertainties arising from policy regulatory and governmental constraints while the expected potential of the emerging markets we are targeting is significant policy promulgation and market development are especially vulnerable to governmental inertia political instability geopolitical risk fossil fuel subsidization potentially stringent localization requirements and limited available infrastructure 

we could be adversely affected by any violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” the uk bribery act and other foreign antibribery laws  

the fcpa generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business other countries in which we operate also have antibribery laws some of which prohibit improper payments to government and nongovernment persons and entities and others eg the fcpa and the uk bribery act extend their application to activities outside of their country of origin our policies mandate compliance with all applicable antibribery laws we currently operate in and pursuant to our long term strategic plan may further expand into key parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices in addition due to the level of regulation in our industry our operation in certain jurisdictions including india china south america and the middle east requires substantial government 

 22 

contact where norms can differ from us standards although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these antibribery laws our officers directors associates subcontractors agents and partners such as joint venture partners may take actions in violation of our policies and antibribery laws any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could subject us and such persons to criminal andor civil penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and reputation 

we may be unable to fully execute on our long term strategic plan which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we face numerous difficulties in executing on our long term strategic plan particularly in new foreign jurisdictions including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  23 

in addition please see the risk factors entitled “ our substantial international operations subject us to a number of risks including unfavorable political regulatory labor and tax conditions in foreign countries ” and “ the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives renewable energy targets and other support for ongrid solar electricity applications or an increase in protectionist or other adverse public policies could reduce demand andor price levels for our solar modules and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales thereby adversely impacting our operating results ” 

we may be unable to profitably provide new solar offerings or achieve sufficient market penetration with such offerings 

we may expand our portfolio of offerings to include solutions that build upon our core competencies but for which we have not had significant historical experience including variations in our traditional product offerings or other offerings related to commercial and industrial customers and community solar we cannot be certain that we will be able to ascertain and allocate the appropriate financial and human resources necessary to grow these business areas we could invest capital into growing these businesses but fail to address market or customer needs or otherwise not experience a satisfactory level of financial return also in expanding into these areas we may be competing against companies that previously have not been significant competitors such as companies that currently have substantially more experience than we do in the rooftop or other targeted offerings if we are unable to achieve growth in these areas our overall growth and financial performance may be limited relative to our competitors and our operating results could be adversely impacted 

an increase in interest rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets including a reduction in total tax equity availability could make it difficult for customers to finance the cost of a pv solar power system and could reduce the demand for our modules or systems andor lead to a reduction in the average selling price for pv modules  

many of our customers and our systems business depend on debt andor equity financing to fund the initial capital expenditure required to develop build andor purchase a pv solar power system as a result an increase in interest rates or a reduction in the supply of project debt financing or tax equity investments could reduce the number of solar projects that receive financing or otherwise make it difficult for our customers or our systems business to secure the financing necessary to develop build purchase or install a pv solar power system on favorable terms or at all and thus lower demand for our solar modules which could limit our growth or reduce our net sales in addition we believe that a significant percentage of our endusers install systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt an increase in interest rates could lower an investor’s return on investment in a system increase equity return requirements or make alternative investments more attractive relative to pv solar power systems and in each case could cause these endusers to seek alternative investments 

  

risks related to regulations 

existing regulations and policies changes thereto and new regulations and policies may present technical regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of pv products or systems which may significantly reduce demand for our solar modules systems or services 

the market for electricity generation products is heavily influenced by foreign federal state and local government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry as well as policies promulgated by electric utilities these regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customerowned electricity generation in the united states and in a number of other countries these regulations and policies have been modified in the past and may be modified again in the future these regulations and policies could deter enduser purchases of pv products and investment in the research and development of pv technology for example without a mandated regulatory exception for pv solar power systems utility customers are often charged interconnection or standby fees for putting distributed power generation on the electric utility grid if these interconnection standby fees were applicable to pv solar power systems it is likely that they would increase the cost of using such systems for endusers which could make the systems less desirable thereby adversely affecting our business financial condition and results of operations in addition with respect to utilities that utilize a peak hour pricing policy or timeofuse pricing methods whereby the price of electricity is adjusted based on electricity supply and demand electricity generated by pv solar power systems currently benefits from competing primarily with expensive peak hour electricity rather than the less expensive average price of electricity modifications to the peak hour pricing policies of utilities such as to a flat rate for all times of the day would require pv solar power systems to achieve lower prices in order to compete with the price of electricity from other sources and would adversely impact our operating results 

 24 

our modules systems and services such as om are subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with national and local ordinances relating to building codes safety environmental protection utility interconnection and metering and other matters and tracking the requirements of individual jurisdictions is complex any new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to our solar modules systems or services may result in significant additional expenses to us or our customers and as a result could cause a significant reduction in demand for our solar modules systems or services in addition any regulatory compliance failure could result in significant management distraction unplanned costs andor reputational damage 

environmental obligations and liabilities could have a substantial negative impact on our financial condition cash flows and profitability   

our operations involve the use handling generation processing storage transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations at the national state local and international levels these environmental laws and regulations include those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the use management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites and occupational health and safety as we execute our long term strategic plan and expand our business into foreign jurisdictions worldwide our environmental compliance burden may continue to increase both in terms of magnitude and complexity we have incurred and may continue to incur significant costs in complying with these laws and regulations in addition violations of or liabilities under environmental laws or permits may result in restrictions being imposed on our operating activities or in our being subjected to substantial fines penalties criminal proceedings thirdparty property damage or personal injury claims cleanup costs or other costs such solutions could also result in substantial delay or termination of projects under construction within our systems business which could adversely impact our results of operations while we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements future developments such as more aggressive enforcement policies the implementation of new more stringent laws and regulations or the discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our cdte solar modules contain cadmium telluride and other semiconductor materials elemental cadmium and certain of its compounds are regulated as hazardous materials due to the adverse health effects that may arise from human exposure based on existing research the risks of exposure to cadmium telluride are not believed to be as serious as those relating to exposure to elemental cadmium in our manufacturing operations we maintain engineering controls to minimize our associates’ exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds and require our associates who handle cadmium compounds to follow certain safety procedures including the use of personal protective equipment such as respirators chemical goggles and protective clothing relevant studies and thirdparty peer review of our technology have concluded that the risk of exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds from our endproducts is negligible in addition the risk of exposure is further minimized by the encapsulated nature of these materials in our products the physical properties of cadmium compounds used in our products and the recycling or responsible disposal of our modules while we believe that these factors and procedures are sufficient to protect our associates endusers and the general public from adverse health effects that may arise from cadmium exposure we cannot ensure that human or environmental exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds used in our products will not occur any such exposure could result in future thirdparty claims against us damage to our reputation and heightened regulatory scrutiny which could limit or impair our ability to sell and distribute our products the occurrence of future events such as these could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

the use of cadmium or cadmium compounds in various products is also coming under increasingly stringent governmental regulation future regulation in this area could impact the manufacturing sale collection and recycling of solar modules and could require us to make unforeseen environmental expenditures or limit our ability to sell and distribute our products for example european union directive 201165eu on the restriction of the use of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment recast rohs directive restricts the use of certain hazardous substances including cadmium and its compounds in specified products other jurisdictions such as china have adopted similar legislation or are considering doing so currently pv modules are explicitly excluded from the scope of recast rohs article 2 as adopted by the european parliament and the council in june 2011 the next general review of the rohs directive is scheduled for 2021 involving a broader discussion of the existing scope a scope review focusing on additional exclusions is expected to be proposed by the european commission in 2016 under the european union’s codecision process which allows the european parliament and the european council to amend the european commission’s proposal on exclusions the codecision procedure is expected to be completed in 2017 or 2018 if pv modules were to be included in the scope of future rohs revisions without an exemption or exclusion we would be required to redesign our solar modules to reduce cadmium and other affected hazardous substances to the maximum allowable concentration thresholds in the rohs directive in order to continue to offer them for sale within the european union as this would be impractical such an event would effectively close the european union market to us which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 25 

as an owner and operator of pv solar power systems that deliver electricity to the grid certain of our affiliated entities may be regulated as public utilities under us federal and state law which could adversely affect the cost of doing business and limit our growth   

as an owner and operator of pv solar power systems that deliver electricity to the grid certain of our affiliated entities may be considered public utilities for purposes of the federal power act as amended the “fpa” and public utility companies for purposes of the public utility holding company act of 2005 “puhca 2005” and are subject to regulation by the ferc as well as various local and state regulatory bodies 

some of our affiliated entities may be exempt wholesale generators or qualifying facilities under the public utility regulatory policies act of 1978 as amended “purpa” and as such are exempt from regulation under puhca 2005 in addition our affiliated entities may be exempt from most provisions of the fpa as well as state laws regarding the financial or organizational regulation of public utilities we are not directly subject to ferc regulation under the fpa however we are considered to be a “holding company” for purposes of section 203 of the fpa which regulates certain transactions involving public utilities and such regulation could adversely affect our ability to grow the business through acquisitions likewise investors seeking to acquire our public utility subsidiaries or acquire ownership interests in our securities sufficient to give them control over us and our public utility subsidiaries may require prior ferc approval to do so such approval could result in transaction delays or uncertainties 

public utilities under the fpa are required to obtain ferc acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of electricity and to comply with various regulations the ferc may grant our affiliated entities the authority to sell electricity at marketbased rates and may also grant them certain regulatory waivers such as waivers from compliance with ferc’s accounting regulations these ferc orders reserve the right to revoke or revise marketbased sales authority if the ferc subsequently determines that our affiliated entities can exercise market power in the sale of generation products the provision of transmission services or if it finds that any of the entities can create barriers to entry by competitors in addition if the entities fail to comply with certain reporting obligations the ferc may revoke their power sales tariffs finally if the entities were deemed to have engaged in manipulative or deceptive practices concerning their power sales transactions they would be subject to potential fines disgorgement of profits andor suspension or revocation of their marketbased rate authority if our affiliated entities were to lose their marketbased rate authority such companies would be required to obtain the ferc’s acceptance of a costofservice rate schedule and could become subject to the accounting recordkeeping and reporting requirements that are imposed on utilities with costbased rate schedules which would impose cost and compliance burdens on us and have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition to the risks described above we may be subject to additional regulatory regimes at state or foreign levels to the extent we own and operate pv solar power systems in such jurisdictions 

  

risks related to our operations manufacturing and technology 

our operating history to date may not serve as an adequate basis to judge our future prospects and results of operations 

our historical operating results may not provide a meaningful basis for evaluating our business financial performance and prospects we may be unable to achieve similar growth or grow at all in future periods our ability to achieve similar growth in future periods is also affected by current economic conditions our past results occurred in an environment where among other things capital was at times more accessible to our customers to finance the cost of developing solar projects and economic incentives for solar power in certain markets were more favorable accordingly you should not rely on our results of operations for any prior period as an indication of our future performance 

we face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules as well as other thinfilm solar modules if global supply exceeds global demand it could lead to a reduction in the average selling price for pv modules  which could reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations 

the solar and renewable energy industries are highly competitive and are continually evolving as participants strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete with the larger electric power industry within the global pv solar industry we face competition from crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers and other thinfilm solar module manufacturers existing or future solar manufacturers might be acquired by larger companies with significant capital resources thereby intensifying competition with us in addition the introduction of a low cost disruptive technology such as commercially viable energy storage could adversely affect our ability to compete which could reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations 

even if demand for solar modules continues to grow the rapid manufacturing capacity expansion undertaken by many solar module manufacturers particularly manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules has created and may continue to cause periods of structural imbalance in which supply exceeds demand see the risk factor entitled “ an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may continue to cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand which 

 26 

could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations ” for additional information in addition we believe any significant decrease in the cost of silicon feedstock would reduce the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules and lead to further pricing pressure for solar modules and potentially the oversupply of solar modules 

  

during any such period our competitors could decide to reduce their sales prices in response to competition even below their manufacturing costs in order to generate sales other competitors may have direct or indirect access to sovereign capital which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time as a result we may be unable to sell our solar modules or systems at attractive prices or for a profit during any period of excess supply of solar modules which would reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations also we may decide to lower our average selling price to certain customers in certain markets in response to competition 

problems with product quality or performance may cause us to incur significant andor unexpected warranty and related expenses damage our market reputation and prevent us from maintaining or increasing our market share 

we perform a variety of module quality and life tests under different conditions upon which we base our assessments and warranty of module performance over the duration of the warranty however if our thinfilm or highefficiency crystalline solar modules perform below expectations we could experience significant warranty and related expenses damage to our market reputation and erosion of market share with respect to our modules we provide a limited warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for 10 years following the transfer of title to our modules we also typically warrant that modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 97 of their labeled power output rating during the first year with the warranty coverage reducing by 07 every year thereafter throughout the 25year performance warranty period as an alternative form of our module power output warranty we also offer an aggregated or system level module performance warranty this system level module performance warranty is designed for utilityscale systems and also provides 25year system level energy degradation protection the system level module performance warranty typically is calculated as a percentage of a system’s expected energy production adjusted for certain actual site conditions with the warranted level of performance declining each year in a linear fashion but never falling below 80 during the term of the warranty as a result of these programs we bear a defined level of risk of product warranty claims long after we have sold our solar modules and recognized net sales 

if any of the assumptions used in estimating our module warranties prove incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses which could adversely impact our financial position operating results and cash flows although we have taken significant precautions to avoid a manufacturing excursion from occurring any manufacturing excursions including any commitments made by us to take remediation actions in respect of affected modules beyond our warranties could adversely impact our business reputation financial position operating results and cash flows 

although our module performance warranties extend for 25 years our oldest solar modules manufactured during the qualification of our pilot production line have only been in use since 2001 accordingly our warranties are based on a variety of quality and life tests that enable predictions of durability and future performance these predictions however could prove to be materially different from the actual performance during the warranty period causing us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective solar modules in the future for example our solar modules could suffer various failure modes including breakage delamination corrosion or performance degradation in excess of expectations and our manufacturing operations or supply chain could be subject to materials or process variations that could cause affected modules to fail or underperform compared to our expectations these risks could be amplified as we implement design and process changes in connection with our efforts to improve our products and accelerate module conversion efficiencies as part of our long term strategic plan in addition as we increase the number of installations in extreme climates we may experience increased failure rates due to deployment into such field conditions any widespread product failures may damage our market reputation cause our net sales to decline require us to repair or replace the defective modules and result in us taking voluntary remedial measures beyond those required by our standard warranty terms to enhance customer satisfaction which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

in resolving claims related to defective modules we have the option to repair or replace the covered modules provide additional modules or make a cash payment equal to the current market price of the modules however historical versions of our module warranty did not provide a refund remedy consequently we may be obligated to repair or replace the covered modules under such historical programs as our manufacturing process may change from timetotime in accordance with our technology roadmap we may elect to stop production of older versions of our modules that would constitute compatible replacement modules in some jurisdictions our inability to provide compatible replacement modules could potentially expose us to liabilities beyond the limitations of our module warranties which could adversely impact our business reputation financial position operating results and cash flows 

 27 

in addition to our solar module warranties we also provide warranties for our bos equipment including but not limited to mounting structures solar trackers electronics and cabling these warranties cover defects in materials and workmanship for one to five years for most equipment and up to 10 years for mounting structures as with our modules these warranties are based on a variety of quality and life tests that enable predictions of durability and future performance for pv solar power systems we construct we also typically provide a limited warranty against defects in engineering design installation and workmanship for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a system any failures in bos equipment or system construction beyond our expectations may also adversely impact our business reputation financial position operating results and cash flows 

as part of our systems business we may provide an energy performance test during the first year of a system’s operation such a test is designed to demonstrate that the actual energy generation for the first year meets or exceeds the modeled energy expectation after certain adjustments such as irradiance weather module degradation soiling curtailment and other conditions that may affect a system’s energy output but are unrelated to the quality design or construction if there is an underperformance event determined at the end of the first year after substantial completion we may incur liquidated damages as a percentage of the contract price 

if our estimates regarding the future costs of collecting and recycling cdte solar modules covered by our collection and recycling program are incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses at and from the time we realize our estimates are incorrect and face a significant unplanned cash burden 

we have prefunded and may need to continue to prefund our estimated future costs for collecting and recycling cdte solar modules covered by our collection and recycling program we estimate these costs based on the present value of the expected probability weighted future costs of collecting and recycling the modules which includes estimates for the cost of packaging materials the cost of freight from the solar module installation sites to a recycling center the material labor capital costs and scale of recycling centers and an estimated thirdparty profit margin and return on risk for collection and recycling services we base these estimates on i our experience collecting and recycling our solar modules ii the expected timing of when our solar modules will be returned for recycling and iii expected economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled if our estimates prove incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses at and from the time we realize our estimates are incorrect and could also face a significant unplanned cash burden at the time we realize our estimates are incorrect or endusers return their modules which could adversely affect our operating results in addition participating endusers can return their modules covered under the collection and recycling program at any time as a result we could be required to collect and recycle covered cdte solar modules earlier than we expect 

our failure to further refine our technology reduce module manufacturing and bos costs and develop and introduce improved pv products could render our solar modules or systems uncompetitive and reduce our net sales profitability andor market share 

we need to continue to invest significant financial resources in research and development to continue to improve our module conversion efficiencies lower the lcoe of our pv solar power systems and otherwise keep pace with technological advances in the solar industry however research and development activities are inherently uncertain and we could encounter practical difficulties in commercializing our research results we seek to continuously improve our products and processes and the resulting changes carry potential risks in the form of delays additional costs or other unintended contingencies in addition our significant expenditures on research and development may not produce corresponding benefits other companies are developing a variety of competing pv technologies including advanced multicrystalline silicon cells perc or advanced ptype crystalline silicon cells highefficiency ntype crystalline silicon cells copper indium gallium diselenide and amorphous silicon thin films which could produce solar modules or systems that prove more costeffective or have better performance than our solar modules or systems in addition other companies could potentially develop a highly reliable renewable energy system that mitigates the intermittent power generation drawback of many renewable energy systems or offer other valueadded improvements from the perspective of utilities and other system owners in which case such companies could compete with us even if the lcoe associated with such new system is higher than that of our systems as a result our solar modules or systems may be negatively differentiated or rendered obsolete by the technological advances of our competitors which would reduce our net sales profitability andor market share 

in addition we often forward price our products and services in anticipation of future cost reductions and technology improvements and thus an inability to further refine our technology and execute our module conversion efficiency roadmap and longterm manufacturing cost bos cost and lcoe reduction objectives could adversely affect our operating results 

 28 

our failure to protect our intellectual property rights may undermine our competitive position and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against thirdparty allegations of infringement may be costly 

protection of our proprietary processes methods and other technology is critical to our business failure to protect and monitor the use of our existing intellectual property rights could result in the loss of valuable technologies we rely primarily on patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property we regularly file patent applications to protect inventions arising from our research and development and are currently pursuing such patent applications in various countries in accordance with our strategy for intellectual property in that jurisdiction our existing patents and future patents could be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents or if patents are issued to us such patents may not be sufficient to provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies 

we also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position although we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our associates and third parties to protect our intellectual property such confidentiality agreements are limited in duration and could be breached and may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary manufacturing expertise adequate remedies may not be available in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise in addition others may obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or legal means the failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes equipment technology trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise methods and compounds could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries especially any developing countries into which we may expand our operations in some countries we have not applied for patent trademark or copyright protection 

  

third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary technologies or other intellectual property rights which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology can be difficult and expensive also litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others we cannot ensure that the outcome of such potential litigation will be in our favor such litigation may be costly and may divert management attention and other resources away from our business an adverse determination in any such litigation may impair our intellectual property rights and may harm our business prospects and reputation in addition we have no insurance coverage against such litigation costs and would have to bear all costs arising from such litigation to the extent we are unable to recover them from other parties 

some of our key raw materials and components are either singlesourced or sourced from a limited number of thirdparty suppliers and their failure to perform could cause manufacturing delays and impair our ability to deliver solar modules to customers in the required quality and quantities and at a price that is profitable to us 

our failure to obtain raw materials and components that meet our quality quantity and cost requirements in a timely manner could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture our solar modules or increase our manufacturing cost some of our key raw materials and components are either singlesourced or sourced from a limited number of thirdparty suppliers as a result the failure of any of our suppliers to perform could disrupt our supply chain and impair our operations in addition some of our suppliers are small companies that may be unable to supply our increasing demand for raw materials and components as we continue to expand our business we may be unable to identify new suppliers or qualify their products for use on our production lines in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms a constraint on our production may cause us to be unable to meet our capacity plans andor our obligations under our customer contracts which would have an adverse impact on our business 

a disruption in our supply chain for cadmium telluride could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture solar modules and could adversely impact our profitability and longterm growth prospects 

a key raw material we use in our cdte module production process is a cadmium telluride compound tellurium one of the main components of cadmium telluride is mainly produced as a byproduct of copper refining and therefore its supply is largely dependent upon demand for copper our supply of cadmium telluride could be limited if any of our current suppliers or any of our future suppliers are unable to acquire an adequate supply of tellurium in a timely manner or at commercially reasonable prices if our competitors begin to use or increase their demand for cadmium telluride supply could be reduced and prices could increase if our current suppliers or any of our future suppliers cannot obtain sufficient tellurium they could substantially increase prices or be unable to perform under their contracts we may be unable to pass increases in the costs of our raw materials through to our customers a substantial increase in tellurium prices could adversely impact our profitability and longterm growth objectives

our tetrasun module offering may not be able to achieve profitable commercial scale which could adversely impact our operating results and our future growth objectives with respect to pv solar in restricted spaces 

in 2013 we acquired tetrasun inc a development stage company with highefficiency crystalline silicon technology we expect our highpower density tetrasun modules to offer advantages relative to our cdte modules in certain commercial  industrial rooftop and other space constrained applications although we began manufacturing tetrasun modules during the fourth quarter of 2014 we have less experience with crystalline silicon module manufacturing compared to many of our competitors and accordingly we face numerous risks and uncertainties many of these risks are inherent in pv module manufacturing generally or otherwise similar to risks involved in our cdte pv module manufacturing operations and are discussed elsewhere in item 1a “risk factors” 

additionally scaling of highvolume tetrasun module manufacturing could present supply chain timing and other challenges contrasted with our largely automated cdte manufacturing lines our tetrasun module manufacturing operations involve a batch process and are not fully integrated from initial feedstock to final module potentially resulting in timing cost supply and other constraints we outsource module assembly to a third party and any constraints such party faces in meeting our volume or quality requirements would negatively impact our ability to deliver modules to our customers tetrasun cells are manufactured using ntype monocrystalline wafers we rely on our wafer suppliers to contract polysilicon feedstock in sufficient volumes to meet our demand marketdriven increases in polysilicon prices realized by our wafer suppliers or increases in wafer prices generally would increase our manufacturing costs and negatively impact margins on tetrasun modules 

if we are able to achieve highvolume manufacturing of tetrasun modules we may not have an adequate sales channel for such modules andor the prevailing average selling price or conversion efficiency of pv modules in general may have changed in such a manner as to make our tetrasun modules uncompetitive if our tetrasun modules are unable to achieve profitable commercial scale we may have to write down all or a portion of the assets related to this business area and our future growth strategy with respect to pv solar in restricted spaces could be adversely impacted which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our future success depends on our ability to effectively balance manufacturing production with market demand and when necessary continue to build new manufacturing plants over time in response to such demand and add production lines in a costeffective manner all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties 

our future success depends on our ability to effectively balance manufacturing production with market demand and increase both our manufacturing capacity and production throughput over time in a costeffective and efficient manner if we cannot do so we may be unable to expand our business decrease our manufacturing cost per watt maintain our competitive position satisfy our contractual obligations or sustain profitability see “ an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may continue to cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations ” our ability to expand production capacity is subject to significant risks and uncertainties including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  30 

if any future production lines are not built in line with our committed schedules it may impair any future growth plans if any future production lines do not achieve operating metrics similar to our existing production lines our solar modules could perform below expectations and cause us to lose customers 

if we are unable to systematically replicate our production lines as necessary over time and achieve and sustain similar operating metrics in our future production lines as we have achieved at our existing production lines our manufacturing capacity could be substantially constrained our manufacturing costs per watt could increase and our growth could be limited such factors may result in lower net sales and lower net income than we anticipate for instance future production lines could produce solar modules that have lower conversion efficiencies higher failure rates and higher rates of degradation than solar modules from our existing production lines and we could be unable to determine the cause of the lower operating metrics or develop and implement solutions to improve performance 

some of our manufacturing equipment is customized and sole sourced if our manufacturing equipment fails or if our equipment suppliers fail to perform under their contracts we could experience production disruptions and be unable to satisfy our contractual requirements 

some of our manufacturing equipment is customized to our production lines based on designs or specifications that we provide to equipment manufacturers which then undertake a specialized process to manufacture the custom equipment as a result the equipment is not readily available from multiple vendors and would be difficult to repair or replace if it were to become damaged or stop working if any piece of equipment fails production along the entire production line could be interrupted in addition the failure of our equipment manufacturers to supply equipment in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms could delay our expansion plans otherwise disrupt our production schedule andor increase our manufacturing costs all of which would adversely impact our operating results 

we may be unable to manage the expansion of our operations effectively 

we expect to continue to expand our business in order to provide utilityscale pv generation to existing and new geographic markets and to maintain or increase market share to manage the continued expansion of our operations we will be required to continue to improve our operational and financial systems procedures and controls and expand train manage and retain our growing associate base our management will also be required to maintain and expand our relationships with customers suppliers and other third parties and attract new customers and suppliers in addition our current and planned operations personnel systems and internal controls and procedures might be inadequate to support our future growth the effectiveness of our controls and procedures could be adversely impacted to the extent we transfer more business functions to lower cost geographies as part of our cost reduction initiatives if we cannot manage our growth effectively we may be unable to take advantage of market opportunities execute our business strategies or respond to competitive pressures 

our substantial international operations subject us to a number of risks including unfavorable political regulatory labor and tax conditions in foreign countries  

we have significant marketing distribution and manufacturing operations both within and outside the united states and expect to continue to expand our operations worldwide as a result we will be subject to the legal political social tax and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions risks inherent to international operations include but are not limited to the following 

 

 

 

 

  31 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

our business in foreign markets requires us to respond to rapid changes in market conditions in these countries our overall success as a global business depends in part on our ability to succeed in differing legal regulatory economic social and political conditions we may not be able to develop and implement policies and strategies that will be effective in each location where we do business 

risks related to our systems business 

project development or construction activities may not be successful projects under development may not receive required permits real property rights ppas interconnection and transmission arrangements or financing or construction may not commence or proceed as scheduled which could increase our costs and impair our ability to recover our investments 

the development and construction of solar power electric generation facilities and other energy infrastructure projects involve numerous risks we may be required to spend significant sums for land and interconnection rights preliminary engineering permitting legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built success in developing a particular project is contingent upon among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 32 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

successful completion of a particular project may be adversely affected delayed andor rendered infeasible by numerous factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 33 

 

 

 

 

 

if we fail to complete the development of a solar power project fail to meet one or more agreed upon target construction milestone dates fail to achieve systemlevel capacity or fail to meet other contract terms we may be subject to forfeiture of significant deposits under ppas or interconnection agreements or termination of such agreements incur significant liquidated damages penalties andor other obligations under other project related agreements and may not be able to recover our investment in the project some of these investments are included as assets on our consolidated balance sheets under the line item “ project assets and deferred project costs ” if we are unable to complete the development of a solar power project we may writedown or writeoff some or all of these capitalized investments which would have an adverse impact on our net income in the period in which the loss is recognized 

we may be unable to accurately estimate costs under fixedprice epc agreements in which we act as the general contractor for our customers in connection with the construction and installation of their pv solar power systems 

we may enter into fixedprice epc contracts in which we act as the general contractor for our customers in connection with the installation of their pv solar power systems all essential costs are estimated at the time of entering into the epc contract for a particular project and these are reflected in the overall fixedprice that we charge our customers for the project these cost estimates are preliminary and may or may not be covered by contracts between us or the subcontractors suppliers and other parties to the project in addition we require qualified licensed subcontractors to install many of our systems shortages of such skilled labor could significantly delay a project or otherwise increase our costs should actual results prove different from our estimates including those due to unexpected increases in inflation commodity prices or labor costs or we experience delays in execution and we are unable to commensurately increase the epc sales price we may not achieve our expected margins or we may be required to record a loss in the relevant fiscal period 

we may be unable to acquire or lease land obtain necessary interconnection and transmission rights andor obtain the approvals licenses permits and electric transmission grid interconnection and transmission rights necessary to build and operate pv solar power systems in a timely and cost effective manner and regulatory agencies local communities labor unions tribes or other third parties may delay prevent or increase the cost of construction and operation of the system we intend to build 

in order to construct and operate our pv solar power systems we need to acquire or lease land and rights of way obtain interconnection rights and obtain all necessary local county state federal and foreign approvals licenses and permits as well as rights to interconnect the systems to the transmission grid and transmit energy generated from the system we may be unable to acquire the land or lease interests needed may not obtain or maintain satisfactory interconnection rights may not receive or retain the requisite approvals permits licenses and interconnection and transmission rights or may encounter other problems that could delay or prevent us from successfully constructing and operating such systems 

  

many of our proposed pv solar power systems are located on or require access through public lands administered by federal and state agencies pursuant to competitive public leasing and rightofway procedures and processes the authorization for the use construction and operation of systems and associated transmission facilities on federal state and private lands will also require the assessment and evaluation of mineral rights private rightsofway and other easements environmental agricultural cultural recreational and aesthetic impacts and the likely mitigation of adverse impacts to these and other resources and uses the inability to obtain the required permits and potentially any excessive delays in obtaining such permits due for example to litigation or thirdparty appeals could prevent us from successfully constructing and operating pv solar power systems in a timely manner and could result in the potential forfeiture of any deposit we have made with respect to a given project moreover project approvals subject to project modifications and conditions including mitigation requirements and costs could affect the financial success of a given project changing regulatory requirements and the discovery of unknown site conditions could also affect the financial success of a given project 

 34 

in addition local labor unions may increase the cost of andor lower the productivity of project development in california and elsewhere we may also be subject to labor unavailability andor increased union labor requirements due to multiple simultaneous projects in a geographic region 

lack of transmission capacity availability potential upgrade costs to the transmission grid and other systems constraints could significantly impact our ability to build pv solar power systems and generate solar electricity power sales 

  

in order to deliver electricity from our pv solar power systems to our customers our projects generally need to connect to the transmission grid the lack of available capacity on the transmission grid could substantially impact our projects and cause reductions in project size delays in project implementation increases in costs from transmission upgrades and potential forfeitures of any deposit we have made with respect to a given project these transmission issues as well as issues relating to the availability of large equipment such as transformers and switch gear could significantly impact our ability to build such systems and generate solar electricity sales 

  

our systems business is largely dependent on us and third parties arranging financing from various sources which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms or in insufficient amounts 

  

the construction of large utilityscale solar power projects is expected in many cases to require project financing including nonrecourse project debt financing in the bank loan market and institutional debt capital markets uncertainties exist as to whether our projects will be able to access the debt markets in a magnitude sufficient to finance their construction if we are unable to arrange such financing or if it is only available on unfavorable terms we may be unable to fully execute our systems business plan in addition we generally expect to sell our projects by raising project equity capital from taxoriented strategic industry and other equity investors such equity sources may not be available or may only be available in insufficient amounts or on unfavorable terms in which case our ability to sell our projects may be delayed or limited and our business financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected even if such financing sources are available the counterparty to many of our fixedprice epc contracts which own the project we are constructing are often special purpose vehicles that do not have significant assets other than their interests in the project and have pledged all or substantially all of these assets to secure the projectrelated debt and certain other sources of financing if the owner defaults on its payments or other obligations to us we may face difficulties in collecting payment of amounts due to us for the costs previously incurred or for the amounts previously expended or committed to be expended to purchase equipment or supplies including intercompany purchases of pv modules or for termination payments we are entitled to under the terms of the related epc contract if we are unable to collect the amounts owed to us or are unable to complete the project because of an owner default we may be required to record a charge against earnings related to the project which could result in a material loss 

  

in addition for projects to which we provide epc services but are not the project developer our epc activities are in many cases dependent on the ability of third parties to finance their systems projects which in turn is dependent on their ability to obtain financing for such purchases on acceptable terms depending on prevailing conditions in the credit markets interest rates and other factors such financing may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms or in insufficient amounts if third parties are limited in their ability to access financing to support their purchase of pv solar power system construction services from us we may not realize the cash flows that we expect from such sales which could adversely affect our ability to invest in our business andor generate revenue see also the risk factor above entitled “ an increase in interest rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets including a reduction in total tax equity availability could make it difficult for customers to finance the cost of a pv solar power system and could reduce the demand for our modules or systems andor lead to a reduction in the average selling price for pv modules  ” 

  

developing solar power projects may require significant upfront investment prior to the signing of an epc contract and commencing construction which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our solar power project development cycles which span the time between the identification of land and the commercial operation of a pv solar power system vary substantially and can take many months or years to mature as a result of these long project cycles we may need to make significant upfront investments of resources including for example payments for land rights large transmission and ppa deposits or other payments which may be nonrefundable in advance of the signing of epc contracts commencing construction receiving cash proceeds and recognizing any revenue which may not be recognized for several additional months or years following contract signing our potential inability to enter into sales contracts with potential customers on favorable terms after making such upfront investments could cause us to forfeit certain nonrefundable payments or otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations furthermore we may become constrained in our ability to simultaneously fund our other business operations and these systems investments through our long project development cycles 

 35 

our liquidity may be adversely affected to the extent the project sales market weakens and we are unable to sell our solar projects on pricing timing and other terms commercially acceptable to us in such a scenario we may choose to continue to own and operate certain solar projects for a period of time after which the projects may be sold to third parties 

we may not be able to obtain longterm contracts for the sale of power produced by our projects at prices and on other terms favorable to attract financing and other investments  with regard to projects for which electricity is or will be sold on an opencontract basis rather than under a ppa our results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent prevailing spot electricity prices decline in an unexpected manner 

obtaining longterm contracts for the sale of power produced by our projects at prices and on other terms favorable to us is essential for obtaining financing and commencing construction of our projects we must compete for ppas against other developers of solar and renewable energy projects further other sources of power such as natural gasfired power plants have historically been cheaper than the cost of solar power and power from certain types of projects such as natural gasfired power plants can be delivered on a firm basis the inability to compete successfully against other power producers or otherwise enter into ppas favorable to us would negatively affect our ability to develop and finance our projects and negatively impact our revenue in addition the availability of ppas is dependent on utility procurement practices that could evolve and shift allocation of market risks over time in addition ppa availability and terms are a function of a number of economic regulatory tax and public policy factors which are also subject to change also certain of our projects may be scheduled for substantial completion prior to the commencement of a longterm ppa with a major offtaker in which case we would be required to enter into a stubperiod ppa for the intervening time period or sell down the project we may not be able to do either on terms that are commercially attractive to us finally the electricity from certain of our projects is or will be sold on an opencontract basis for a period of time rather than under a ppa if prevailing spot electricity prices relating to any such project were to decline in an unexpected manner such project may decline in value and our results of operations could otherwise be adversely affected 

we may be subject to unforeseen costs liabilities or obligations when providing om services 

we may provide ongoing om services to system owners under separate service agreements pursuant to which we generally perform standard activities associated with operating a pv solar power system including 247 monitoring and control compliance activities energy forecasting and scheduled and unscheduled maintenance our costs to perform these services are estimated at the time of entering into the om agreement for a particular project and these are reflected in the price we charge our customers we have limited experience in performing om services in certain jurisdictions outside of the united states canada and australia where we plan to offer pv systems solutions as part of our long term strategic plan including estimating actual costs for such jurisdictions under our om agreements relative to the price that we charge our customers should our estimates of om costs prove inaccurate including any unexpected increases in inflation or labor or bos costs our growth strategy and results of operations could be adversely affected because of the potentially longterm nature of these om agreements the adverse impacts on our results of operations could be significant particularly if our costs are not capped under the terms of the agreements we may also be subject to substantial costs in the event we do not achieve certain thresholds under the effective availability guarantees included in our om agreements 

our systems business is subject to regulatory oversight and liability if we fail to operate our pv solar power systems in compliance with electric reliability rules 

the ongoing om services that we provide for system owners may subject us to regulation by the north american electric reliability corporation “nerc” or its designated regional representative as a “generator operator” or “gop” under electric reliability rules filed with ferc our failure to comply with the reliability rules applicable to gops could subject us to substantial fines by nerc subject to ferc’s review in addition the system owners that receive our om services may be regulated by nerc as “generator owners” or “gos” and we may incur liability for go violations and fines levied by nerc subject to ferc’s review based on the terms of our om agreements finally as a systems owner and operator we may in the future be subject to regulation by nerc as a go 

 36 

other risks 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future business combinations or transactions and integration of these business combinations may disrupt our business and management 

we have made several acquisitions in the last several years and in the future we may acquire additional companies project pipelines products or technologies or enter into joint ventures or other strategic initiatives we may not realize the anticipated benefits of a business combination and each transaction has numerous risks these risks include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mergers and acquisitions of companies are inherently risky and ultimately if we do not complete the integration of acquired businesses successfully and in a timely manner we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions to the extent anticipated which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the formation of 8point3 energy partners lp on a timely basis or at all  

in june 2015 8point3 energy partners lp the “yieldco” or the “partnership” a limited partnership formed by first solar and sunpower corporation “sunpower” completed its initial public offering the yieldco is a joint venture vehicle into which we and sunpower each contributed a portfolio of selected solar generation assets from our existing portfolios of assets we launched the yieldco to enable a competitive cost of capital and greater optionality in the project sales process for a portion of our future project sales given the broader economic factors currently impacting the yieldco sector in general including yieldco equity valuations generally the timing and execution of asset drop downs to the yieldco are subject to market conditions we believe 

 37 

that the viability of the yieldco strategy will depend on among other things such market conditions and our ability to continue to develop revenuegenerating solar assets which is subject to the same projectlevel business and industry risks described in the other risk factors contained in this annual report on form 10k the viability of the yieldco strategy is also subject to the risks described in the yieldco’s annual report on form 10k in addition due to the joint venture nature of the yieldco we do not exercise control over the yieldco in the same manner that we could over our whollyowned subsidiaries and as such the viability of the yieldco strategy will also depend in part on our ability to effectively manage our business relationships with sunpower furthermore the value of our investment in the yieldco will fluctuate over time and may decline as a result we may never recover the value of the assets we contributed to the yieldco and we may realize less of a return on such contributions than if we had retained or operated the assets in addition our stock price may be impacted by fluctuations in the price of yieldco shares and market perceptions about the value of our interest in the yieldco if we are unable to achieve the strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the yieldco strategy we would pursue traditional and other pathways in the project sales process but our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected see note 12 “investments in unconsolidated affiliates and joint ventures”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

our future success depends on our ability to retain our key associates and to successfully integrate them into our management team 

we are dependent on the services of our executive officers and other members of our senior management team the loss of one or more of these key associates or any other member of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business we may not be able to retain or replace these key associates and we may not have adequate succession plans in place several of our current key associates including our executive officers are subject to employment conditions or arrangements that contain postemployment noncompetition provisions however these arrangements permit the associates to terminate their employment with us upon little or no notice and the enforceability of the noncompetition provisions in certain jurisdictions is uncertain 

if we are unable to attract train and retain key personnel our business may be materially and adversely affected any regulatory compliance failure with respect to applicable labor laws and regulations including the davisbacon and related acts could have an adverse effect on us 

our future success depends to a significant extent on our ability to attract train and retain management operations sales training and technical personnel including in foreign jurisdictions as we continue to execute on our long term strategic plan recruiting and retaining capable personnel particularly those with expertise in the pv industry across a variety of technologies are vital to our success there is substantial competition for qualified technical personnel and while we continue to benchmark our organization against the broad spectrum of business in our market space to remain economically competitive there can be no assurances that we will be able to attract and retain our technical personnel if we are unable to attract and retain qualified associates or otherwise experience unexpected labor disruptions within our business we may be materially and adversely affected 

labor used on some of our job sites that are completed or under construction are subject to the davisbacon and related acts collectively “davisbacon” davisbacon requires that personnel assigned to the project be paid at least the prevailing wage and fringe benefits as established by and in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the us department of labor “dol” we have an established policy pursuant to which we evaluate davisbacon requirements in conjunction with our subcontractors on the project and ensure our collective compliance with these requirements if it was ultimately determined that any person working under davisbacon requirements on first solar projects was not properly classified was being paid the incorrect prevailing wage or had not been paid fringe benefits to which he or she was entitled we could incur additional liability with respect to such worker or be exposed to other adverse outcomes for example in march 2015 the wage and hour division of the dol notified our whollyowned subsidiary first solar electric llc “fse” of the dol’s findings following a labor standards compliance review under davisbacon at our agua caliente project in southwestern arizona fse served as the general contractor for the project the dol alleges that certain workers at the project were misclassified and as a result of that misclassification were not paid the required prevailing wage we disagree with certain of the dol’s investigative findings and are reviewing those issues of disagreement with the dol possible adverse outcomes include the payment of back wages and debarment of fse and its affiliates from doing certain business with the us federal government we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the dol proceeding

we may be exposed to infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties which if determined adversely to us could cause us to pay significant damage awards or prohibit us from the manufacture and sale of our solar modules or the use of our technology 

our success depends largely on our ability to use and develop our technology and knowhow without infringing or misappropriating the intellectual property rights of third parties the validity and scope of claims relating to pv technology patents involve complex scientific legal and factual considerations and analysis and therefore may be highly uncertain we may be subject to litigation involving claims of patent infringement or violation of intellectual property rights of third parties the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits patent opposition proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings can be both costly and time consuming and may significantly divert the efforts and resources of our technical and management personnel an adverse determination in any such litigation or proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liability to third parties require us to seek licenses from third parties which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all or pay ongoing royalties require us to redesign our solar modules or subject us to injunctions prohibiting the manufacture and sale of our solar modules or the use of our technologies protracted litigation could also result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of our solar modules until the resolution of such litigation 

currency translation and transaction risk may negatively affect our results of operations 

although our reporting currency is the us dollar we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most countries in which we operate as a result we are subject to currency translation and transaction risk for example certain of our net sales in 2015  were denominated in foreign currencies such as australian dollars indian rupees and euros and we expect more than a minor percentage of our net sales to be outside the united states and denominated in foreign currencies in the future in addition our operating expenses for our manufacturing plants located outside the us and our operations for our systems business in foreign countries will generally be denominated in local currencies joint ventures or other business arrangements with strategic partners outside of the united states have involved and are expected in the future to involve significant investments denominated in local currencies changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar could affect our results of operations and result in exchange gains or losses we cannot accurately predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations 

we could also expand our business into emerging markets many of which have an uncertain regulatory environment relating to currency policy conducting business in such emerging markets could cause our exposure to changes in exchange rates to increase due to the relatively high volatility associated with emerging market currencies and potentially longer payment terms for our proceeds 

our ability to hedge foreign currency exposure is dependent on our credit profile with the banks that are willing and able to do business with us deterioration in our credit position or a significant tightening of the credit market conditions could limit our ability to hedge our foreign currency exposure and therefore result in exchange gains or losses 

sustained declines in worldwide oil prices could adversely affect trading prices of our common shares 

worldwide oil prices have declined over the last few years and may continue to decline or remain low oil is used as a fuel for electricity generation in only a small percentage of applications worldwide compared to natural gas or coalfired electricity generation and other forms of electricity generation and accordingly fluctuations in oil prices generally do not have a significant direct causal effect on prevailing competitive electricity prices including electricity from solar sources nonetheless there can be an observed market correlation effect between declining oil prices and depressed equity valuations of solar companies if oil prices remain low or continue to decline the trading price of our common shares may suffer 

global sovereign debt issues could adversely impact our business 

potential sovereign debt issues in europe emerging markets and other regions and their impact on the balance sheets and lending practices of global banks in particular could negatively impact our access to and cost of capital and therefore could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and competitive position it could also similarly affect our customers and therefore limit the sales of our modules and demand for our systems sovereign debt problems may also cause governments to reduce eliminate or allow to expire government subsidies and economic incentives for solar energy which could limit our growth or cause our net sales to decline and materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 39 

we are subject to litigation risks including securities class actions and stockholder derivative actions which may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain 

from time to time we are subject to legal claims with and without merit that may be costly and which may divert the attention of our management and our resources in general in addition our projects may be subject to litigation or other adverse proceedings that may adversely impact our ability to proceed with construction or sell a given project which would adversely affect our ability to recognize revenue with respect to such project the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict moreover many of the complaints filed against us do not specify the amount of damages that plaintiffs seek and we therefore are unable to estimate the possible range of damages that might be incurred should these lawsuits be resolved against us certain of these lawsuits assert types of claims that if resolved against us could give rise to substantial damages and an unfavorable outcome or settlement of one or more of these lawsuits or any future lawsuits may result in a significant monetary judgment or award against us or a significant monetary payment by us and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations even if these lawsuits or any future lawsuits are not resolved against us the costs of defending such lawsuits may be significant and may not be covered by our insurance policies because the price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile we can provide no assurance that additional securities or other litigation will not be filed against us in the future for more information on our legal proceedings including our securities class action and derivative actions see “ note 16 “commitments and contingencies”  under the heading “legal proceedings” of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2015  included in this annual report on form 10k 

our largest stockholder has significant influence over us and its interests may conflict with or differ from interests of other stockholders 

our largest stockholder consisting collectively of jcl fslr holdings llc and its beneficiaries and jtw trust no 1 uad 91902 and its beneficiaries each affiliated in the past with the former estate of john t walton collectively the “significant stockholder” owned approximately 26  of our outstanding common stock at december 31 2015  as a result the significant stockholder has substantial influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of our directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions such as mergers tender offers and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets the interests of the significant stockholder could conflict with or differ from interests of other stockholders for example the concentration of ownership held by the significant stockholder could delay defer or prevent a change of control of our company or impede a merger takeover or other business combination which other stockholders may view favorably 

if our goodwill and other intangible assets or project related assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 

we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements should we determine that our goodwill other intangible assets or project assets are impaired such a charge might have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 

  

as required by accounting rules we review our goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill is less than its carrying value factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill might not be recoverable include a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant decline in projections of future cash flows and lower future growth rates in our industry 

we review project related assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable we consider a project commercially viable and recoverable if it is anticipated to be sellable for a profit once it is either fully developed or constructed or if the expected operating cash flows from future power generation exceed the cost basis of the asset if our projects are not considered commercially viable we would be required to impair the respective assets 

unanticipated changes in our tax provisions the adoption of a new tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge for inventory services licenses funding and other intercompany transactions we are subject to potential tax examinations in these various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges crossjurisdictional transfer pricing or other tax positions and assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these examinations in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these potential examinations and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of examinations 

 40 

could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and therefore could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows in addition our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure a loss of our malaysian tax holiday changes in the mix of earnings in countries with tax holidays or differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process a number of proposals for broad reform of the corporate tax system in the us are under evaluation by various legislative and administrative bodies but it is not possible to accurately determine the overall impact of such proposals on our effective tax rate at this time changes in tax laws or regulations including multijurisdictional changes enacted in response to the guidelines provided by the organization for economic cooperation and development to address base erosion and profit sharing may increase tax uncertainty and adversely affect our results of operations 

cyber attacks or other breaches of our information systems or those of third parties with which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

our operations rely on our computer systems hardware software and networks as well as those of the third parties with which we do business to securely process store and transmit proprietary confidential and other information including intellectual property such information systems may be compromised by cyber attacks computer viruses and other events that put the security of our information and that of the third parties with which we do business at risk of misappropriation or destruction in recent years such cyber incidents have become increasingly frequent and sophisticated targeting or otherwise affecting a wide range of companies while we have instituted security measures to minimize the likelihood and impact of a cyber incident there is no assurance that these measures or those of the third parties with which we do business will be adequate in the future if these measures fail valuable information may be lost our manufacturing construction om and other operations may be disrupted and our reputation may suffer we may also be subject to litigation regulatory action remedial expenses and financial losses beyond the scope or limits of our insurance coverage these consequences of a failure of security measures could individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

changes in or any failure to comply with privacy laws regulations and standards may adversely affect our business 

personal privacy and data security have become significant issues in the united states europe and in many other jurisdictions in which we operate the regulatory framework for privacy and security issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future for example the court of justice of the european union recently ruled that the useu safe harbor framework which provided us companies with a streamlined means of complying with the european union’s data protection directive regarding the treatment of customers’ and employees’ personal information and other privacy matters and upon which we relied for the transfer of personal data from the eu to the us was invalid furthermore federal state or foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted and may in the future adopt laws and regulations affecting data privacy industry organizations also regularly adopt and advocate for new standards in this area in the united states these include rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of federal agencies and state attorneys general and legislatures and consumer protection agencies internationally many jurisdictions in which we operate have established their own data security and privacy legal framework with which we or our customers must comply including but not limited to the data protection directive established in the european union and data protection legislation of the individual member states subject to such directive the data protection directive may be replaced in time with the pending european general data protection regulation which may impose additional obligations and risk upon our business in many jurisdictions enforcement actions and consequences for noncompliance are also rising in addition to government regulation privacy advocates and industry groups may propose new and different selfregulatory standards that either legally or contractually apply to us any inability or perceived inability to adequately address privacy and security concerns even if unfounded or comply with applicable privacy and data security laws regulations and policies could result in additional cost and liability to us damage our reputation inhibit sales and adversely affect our business 

our credit agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business 

we may be unable to respond to changes in business and economic conditions engage in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us and obtain additional financing if needed because our revolving credit facility our malaysian credit facility agreements and certain of our project financing arrangements contain and other future debt agreements may contain covenant restrictions that limit our ability to among other things 

 

 

  41 

 

 

under our revolving credit facility our malaysian credit facility agreements and certain of our project financing arrangements we are also subject to certain financial covenants our ability to comply with covenants under our credit agreements is dependent on our future performance which will be subject to many factors some of which are beyond our control including prevailing economic conditions in addition our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under these agreements and any of our other future debt agreements which if not cured or waived could permit the holders thereof to accelerate such debt and could cause crossdefaults under our other facility agreements and the possible acceleration of debt under such other facility agreements as well as crossdefaults under certain of our key project and operational agreements and could also result in requirements to post additional security instruments to secure future obligations in addition we cannot assure you that events that occur within the company or in the industry or the economy as a whole will not constitute material adverse effects under these agreements if it is determined that a material adverse effect has occurred the lenders can under certain circumstances restrict future borrowings or accelerate the due date of outstanding loan balances if any of our debt is accelerated we may in the future not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt and we may experience crossdefaults under our other debt agreements or project and key operational agreements which could materially and negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations

executive overview 

we are a leading global provider of comprehensive pv solar energy solutions we design manufacture and sell pv solar modules with an advanced thinfilm semiconductor technology and also develop design construct and sell pv solar power systems that primarily use the modules we manufacture additionally we provide om services to system owners that use solar modules manufactured by us or by other thirdparty manufacturers we have substantial ongoing research and development efforts focused on module and system level innovations we are the world’s largest thinfilm pv solar module manufacturer and one of the world’s largest pv solar module manufacturers our mission is to create enduring value by enabling a world powered by clean affordable solar energy 

certain highlights of our financial results and other key developments include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 46 

market overview 

the solar industry continues to be characterized by intense pricing competition both at the module and system levels in the aggregate we believe manufacturers of solar modules and cells have relative to global demand significant installed production capacity and the ability for additional capacity expansion we believe the solar industry may from time to time experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity exceeds global demand and that such periods will put pressure on pricing additionally intense competition at the system level can result in an environment in which pricing falls rapidly thereby further increasing demand for solar energy solutions but constraining the ability for project developers epc companies and verticallyintegrated solar companies such as first solar to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability in light of such market realities we are executing our long term strategic plan vision 2020 described below under which we are focusing on our competitive strengths such strengths include our advanced module and system technologies as well as our differentiated verticallyintegrated business model that enables us to provide utilityscale pv solar energy solutions to key geographic markets with immediate electricity needs 

worldwide solar markets continue to develop in part aided by demand elasticity resulting from declining industry average selling prices both at the module and system level which make solar power more affordable to new markets and we have continued to develop our localized presence and expertise in such markets we are developing constructing or operating multiple solar projects around the world many of which are the largest or among the largest in their regions in north america we continue to execute on our advancedstage utilityscale project pipeline which includes the construction of some of the world’s largest pv solar power systems we expect a substantial portion of our consolidated net sales operating income and cash flows through the end of 2016  to be derived from these projects we continue to advance the development and selling efforts for the other projects included in our advancedstage utilityscale project pipeline and also continue to develop our earlytomid stage project pipeline and evaluate acquisitions of projects to continue to add to our advancedstage utilityscale project pipeline 

lower industry module and system pricing while currently challenging for certain solar manufacturers particularly manufacturers with high cost structures is expected to continue to contribute to global market diversification and volume elasticity over time declining average selling prices are consistent with the erosion of one of the primary historical constraints to widespread solar market penetration its affordability in the near term however declining average selling prices could adversely affect our results of operations if competitors reduce pricing to levels below their costs bid aggressively low prices for ppas and epc agreements or are able to operate at negative or minimal operating margins for sustained periods of time our results of operations could be further adversely affected we continue to mitigate this uncertainty in part by executing on and building our advancedstage utilityscale systems pipeline executing on our module efficiency improvement and bos cost reduction roadmaps and continuing the development of key geographic markets 

we continue to face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules and other types of solar modules and pv solar power systems solar module manufacturers compete with one another in several product performance attributes including conversion efficiency energy density reliability and selling price per watt and with respect to pv solar power systems net present value return on equity and lcoe meaning the net present value of total life cycle costs of the pv solar power system divided by the quantity of energy which is expected to be produced over the system’s life 

we believe we are among the lowest cost pv module manufacturers in the solar industry on a module cost per watt basis based on publicly available information this cost competitiveness is reflected in the price at which we sell our modules and fully integrated pv solar power systems and enables our systems to compete favorably our cost competitiveness is based in large part on our module conversion efficiency proprietary manufacturing technology which enables us to produce a cdte module in less than 25  hours using a continuous and highly automated industrial manufacturing process as opposed to a batch process our scale and our operational excellence in addition our cdte modules use approximately 12  of the amount of the semiconductor material that is used to manufacture traditional crystalline silicon solar modules the cost of polysilicon is a significant driver of the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules and the timing and rate of change in the cost of silicon feedstock and polysilicon could lead to changes in solar module pricing levels polysilicon costs have had periods of decline over the past several years contributing to a decline in our relative manufacturing cost competitiveness over traditional crystalline silicon module manufacturers given the smaller size sometimes referred to as form factor of our cdte modules compared to certain types of crystalline silicon modules we may incur higher labor and bos costs associated with systems using our modules thus to compete effectively on an lcoe basis our modules may need to maintain a certain cost advantage per watt compared to crystalline siliconbased modules with larger form factors bos costs represent a significant portion of the costs associated with the construction of a typical utilityscale pv solar power system 

 47 

in terms of energy density in many climates our cdte modules provide a significant energy yield advantage over conventional crystalline silicon solar modules of equivalent efficiency rating for example in humid climates our cdte modules provide a superior spectral response and in hot climates our cdte modules provide a superior temperature coefficient as a result at temperatures above 25°c standard test conditions our cdte modules produce more energy than competing conventional crystalline silicon solar modules with an equivalent efficiency rating this advantage provides stronger system performance in high temperature climates which is particularly advantageous as the vast majority of a system’s generation on average in typical high insolation climates occurs when module temperatures are above 25°c as a result our pv solar power systems can produce more annual energy at a lower lcoe than competing systems with the same nameplate capacity 

while our modules and pv solar power systems are generally competitive in cost reliability and performance attributes there can be no guarantee such competitiveness will continue to exist in the future to the same extent or at all any declines in the competitiveness of our products could result in additional margin compression further declines in the average selling prices of our modules and systems erosion in our market share for modules and systems decreases in the rate of net sales growth andor declines in overall net sales we continue to focus on enhancing the competitiveness of our solar modules and pv solar power systems by accelerating progress along our module efficiency improvement and bos cost reduction roadmaps continuing to make technological advances at the system level leveraging volume procurement around standardized hardware platforms using innovative installation techniques and knowhow and accelerating installation times to reduce labor costs 

as we continue to expand our systems business into key geographic markets we can offer value beyond solar modules reduce our exposure to moduleonly competition provide differentiated product offerings to minimize the impact of solar module commoditization and provide comprehensive utilityscale pv solar power system solutions that reduce solar electricity costs thus our systems business allows us to play a more active role than many of our competitors in managing the demand for our solar modules finally we continue to form and develop strong relationships with our customers and strategic partners around the world and continue to refine our product offerings including epc capabilities and om services in order to enhance the competitiveness of systems using our modules for example we have formed and expect in the future to form joint ventures or other business arrangements with project developers in certain strategic markets in order to provide our modules and utilityscale pv solar energy solutions to the projects developed by such ventures 

certain trends and uncertainties 

we believe that our operations may be favorably or unfavorably impacted by the following trends and uncertainties that may affect our financial condition and results of operations see item 1a “risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of other risks that may affect our financial condition and results of operations 

long term strategic plan vision 2020 

our long term strategic plan vision 2020 is a longterm roadmap to achieve our growth objectives and our technology and cost leadership goals in executing our long term strategic plan we are focusing on providing utilityscale pv solar energy solutions using our modules to key geographic markets that we believe have a compelling need for massscale pv electricity including markets throughout the americas asia the middle east and africa as part of our long term strategic plan we are focusing on opportunities in which our pv solar energy solutions can compete directly with fossil fuel offerings on an lcoe or similar basis or complement such fossil fuel electricity offerings execution of the long term strategic plan entails a prioritization of market opportunities worldwide relative to our core strengths and a corresponding allocation of resources around the globe this prioritization involves a focus on our core utilityscale offerings and exists within a current market environment that includes rooftop and distributed generation solar particularly in the us while it is unclear how rooftop and distributed generation solar might impact our core utilityscale offerings in the next several years we believe that utilityscale solar will continue to be a compelling solar offering for companies with technology and cost leadership and will continue to represent an increasing portion of the overall electricity generation mix 

we are closely evaluating and managing the appropriate level of resources required as we pursue the most advantageous and cost effective projects and partnerships in our target markets we have dedicated and intend to continue to dedicate significant capital and human resources to reduce the total installed cost of pv solar energy to optimize the design and logistics around our pv solar energy solutions and to ensure that our solutions integrate well into the overall electricity ecosystem of each specific market we expect that over time an increasing portion of our consolidated net sales operating income and cash flows may come from solar offerings in the key geographic markets described above as we execute on our long term strategic plan the timing execution and financial impacts of our long term strategic plan are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in item 1a “risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k we are focusing our resources in those markets and energy applications in which solar power can be a leastcost bestfit energy solution particularly in regions with high solar resources significant current or projected electricity demand andor relatively high existing electricity prices as part of these efforts we 

 48 

continue to expand or reallocate resources globally including business development sales personnel and other supporting professional staff in target markets accordingly we may shift current costs or incur additional costs over time as we establish a localized business presence in these target markets 

joint ventures or other strategic arrangements with partners are a key part of our long term strategic plan and we generally use such arrangements to expedite our penetration of various key markets and establish relationships with potential customers we also enter into joint ventures or strategic arrangements with customers or other entities to maximize the value of particular projects some of these arrangements involve and are expected in the future to involve significant investments or other allocations of capital we continue to develop relationships with policymakers regulators and end customers in these strategic markets with a view to creating opportunities for utilityscale pv solar power systems we sell such systems directly to end customers including utilities independent power producers commercial and industrial companies and other system owners depending on the market opportunity our sales offerings may range from moduleonly sales to module sales with a range of development epc services and other solutions to full turnkey pv solar power system sales we expect these offerings to continue to evolve over time as we work with our customers to optimize how our pv solar energy solutions can best meet our customers’ energy and economic needs 

in order to create or maintain a market position in certain strategically targeted markets our offerings from time to time may need to be competitively priced at levels associated with minimal gross profit margins which may adversely affect our results of operations we expect the profitability associated with our various sales offerings to vary from one another over time and possibly vary from our internal longrange profitability expectations and targets depending on the market opportunity and the relative competitiveness of our offerings compared with other energy solutions fossil fuelbased or otherwise that are available to potential customers in addition as we execute on our long term strategic plan we will continue to monitor and adapt to any changing dynamics in the market set of potential buyers of solar project assets market environments with few potential project buyers and a higher cost of capital would generally exert downward pressure on the potential revenue from the uncontracted solar project assets we are developing whereas conversely market environments with many potential project buyers and a lower cost of capital would likely have a favorable impact on the potential revenue from such uncontracted solar project assets 

we expect to use our working capital the availability under our revolving credit facility or project financing to finance the construction of certain pv solar power systems for strategic purposes or to maximize the value of such systems at the time of sale from time to time we may temporarily own and operate certain pv solar power systems often with the intention to sell at a later date we may also elect to construct and temporarily retain ownership interests in systems for which there is no ppa with an offtaker such as a utility but rather an intent to sell the electricity produced by the system on an open contract basis until the system is sold we also continue to assess and pursue business arrangements that provide access to a lower cost of capital and optimize the value of our projects business arrangements that provide a competitive cost of capital and other benefits relating to the project sales process such as our recently formed yieldco as described below and under the heading “8point3 energy partners lp” have been used increasingly by renewable energy companies additionally our joint ventures and other business arrangements with strategic partners have and may in the future result in us temporarily retaining a noncontrolling ownership interest in the underlying systems projects we develop supply modules to or construct potentially for a period of up to several years such business arrangements could become increasingly important to our competitive profile in markets globally including north america in each of the above mentioned examples we may retain such ownership interests in a consolidated or unconsolidated separate entity 

8point3 energy partners lp 

as previously disclosed in a current report on form 8k filed with the sec on june 30 2015 8point3 energy partners lp the “partnership” a limited partnership formed by first solar and sunpower the “sponsors” completed its initial public offering the “ipo” in june 2015 as part of the ipo we contributed various projects to a subsidiary of the partnership in exchange for a 31  interest in the entity we also received a distribution of 2837 million  following the ipo the partnership owns operates and is expected to acquire additional solar energy generation projects from the sponsors and is expected to provide a competitive cost of capital and greater optionality in the project sales process the partnership’s initial project portfolio includes interests in more than 04 gw  of various solar energy generation projects and the partnership also has rights of first offer on interests in over 11 gw  of additional solar energy generation projects that are currently contracted or are expected to be contracted prior to being sold by the sponsors given the broader economic factors currently impacting the yieldco sector in general including yieldco equity valuations generally the timing and execution of asset drop downs to the partnership are subject to market conditions for additional information see item 1a “risk factors – we may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the formation of 8point3 energy partners lp on a timely basis or at all ” and “note 12 investments in unconsolidated affiliates and joint ventures – 8point3 energy partners lp” of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k

construction of some of the world’s largest pv solar power systems 

we continue to execute on our advancedstage utilityscale project pipeline and expect a substantial portion of our consolidated net sales operating income and cash flows through 2016  to be derived from several large projects in this pipeline including the following contracted projects which will be among the world’s largest pv solar power systems the 300 mw desert stateline project located in san bernardino county california the 250 mw mccoy solar energy project located in riverside county california the 250 mw silver state south project located in clark county nevada the 175 mw astoria project located in kern county california and the 150 mw imperial solar energy center west project located in imperial county california our advanced stage utilityscale project pipeline also includes the following projects which are not yet sold or contracted the 280 mw california flats project located in monterey county california the 250 mw moapa project located in clark county nevada the 150 mw rosamond project located in kern county california the 150 mw sun streams project located in maricopa county arizona and the 141 mw luz del norte project located near copiapó chile please see the tables under “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – systems project pipeline” for additional information about these and other projects within our systems business advancedstage project pipeline the construction progress of these projects is subject to risks and delays as described in item 1a “risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k revenue recognition for these and other system projects is in many cases not linear in nature due to the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria are met and consequently periodoverperiod comparisons of results of operations may not be meaningful expected revenue from projects without a ppa for which electricity will be sold on an open contract basis may be subject to greater variability and uncertainty based on market factors compared to projects with a ppa

the following tables summarize as of february 23 2016  our approximately 38 gw  systems business advancedstage project pipeline as of december 31 2015  for the projects soldunder contract in our advancedstage project pipeline of approximately 16 gw  we have recognized revenue with respect to the equivalent of approximately 09 gw  such mw equivalent amount refers to the ratio of revenue recognized for the projects soldunder contract compared to the total contracted revenue for such projects multiplied by the total mw for such projects the remaining revenue to be recognized subsequent to december 31 2015  for the projects soldunder contract is expected to be approximately 17 billion  the majority of such amount is expected to be recognized as revenue through the later of the substantial completion or closing dates of the projects the remaining revenue to be recognized does not have a direct correlation to expected remaining module shipments for such projects soldunder contract as expected module shipments do not represent total systems revenues and do not consider the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria are met including the timing of module installation the actual volume of modules installed in our projects soldunder contract will be greater than the project size in mw ac as module volumes required for a project are based upon mw dc which will be greater than the mw ac size pursuant to a dcac ratio typically ranging from 12 to 13  such ratio varies across different projects due to various system design factors projects are removed from our advancedstage project pipeline tables below once we have substantially completed construction and after substantially all revenue has been recognized projects or portions of projects may also be removed from the tables below in the event an epccontracted or partnerdeveloped project does not get permitting or financing or an unsold or uncontracted project does not get sold or contracted due to the changing economics of the project or other factors 

we continually seek to make additions to our advancedstage project pipeline we are actively developing our early to midstage project pipeline in order to secure ppas and are also pursuing opportunities to acquire advancedstage projects which already have ppas in place new additions to our project pipeline during the period from february 25 2015 to february 23 2016  included 250  mw ac of solar power projects in california 279  mw ac of solar power projects in nevada a 150  mw ac solar power project in arizona a 119  mw ac solar power project in texas a 103  mw ac solar power project in georgia 99  mw ac of solar power projects in japan 55  mw ac of solar power projects in india a 26  mw ac solar power project in honduras and an 18  mw ac solar power project in turkey

results of operations 

during 2015 we revised our previously issued financial statements from 2011 to 2014 to properly record a liability associated with an uncertain tax position related to income of a foreign subsidiary additional revisions were made for previously identified errors that were corrected in a period subsequent to the period in which the error originated all financial information presented herein was revised to reflect the correction of these errors see note 1 “first solar and its business – revision of previously issued financial statements” to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2015  included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  



segment overview 

we operate our business in two segments our components segment involves the design manufacture and sale of solar modules which convert sunlight into electricity and our systems segment includes the development construction operation and maintenance of pv solar power systems which primarily use our solar modules 

see note 23   “segment and geographical information ”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2015  included in this annual report on form 10k see also item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – systems project pipeline” for a description of the system projects in our advancedstage project pipeline 

product revenue 

the following table sets forth the total amounts of solar module and solar power system net sales for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  for the purpose of the following table i solar module revenue is composed of total net sales from the sale of solar modules to third parties and ii solar power system revenue is composed of total net sales from the sale of pv solar power systems and related services and solutions including the solar modules installed in the systems we develop and construct along with revenue generated from such systems in thousands 



 53 

solar module revenue to third parties decreased  by 09 million  during 2015  compared to 2014  primarily due to a 10 decrease in the average selling price per watt partially offset by an 11 increase in the volume of watts sold 

solar power system revenue increased  by 1887 million  during 2015  compared to 2014  primarily due to higher revenue from module plus transactions our net sales for 2015 also included the sale of majority interests in the partially constructed desert stateline project and north star project and higher revenue from our silver state south mccoy and imperial energy center west projects which commenced construction in late 2014 these 2015 net sales were offset by lower revenue from the completion or substantial completion of our desert sunlight solar gen 2 topaz and campo verde projects in 2014 

solar module revenue to third parties decreased  by 1526 million  during 2014  compared to 2013  primarily as a result of a 26 decrease in the volume of watts sold and a 19 decrease in the average selling price per watt 

solar power system revenue increased  by 2341 million  during 2014  compared to 2013  primarily as a result of the number and size of projects under construction between these periods as well as the timing of when all the revenue recognition criteria was met specifically the increase was attributable to higher revenue from the partial sale of our solar gen 2 project the sale of our campo verde and macho springs projects and the commencement of construction and related revenue recognition on multiple projects in california and our agl nyngan project in australia these increases were partially offset by decreases in systems business project revenue from our desert sunlight project as it neared substantial completion our completed first phase of the imperial solar energy center south project and our completed amherstburg belmont walpole and agua caliente projects 

net sales 

components business 

we generally price and sell our solar modules per watt of nameplate power during 2015  a significant portion of net sales for the components business related to modules included in our pv solar power systems described below under “net sales – systems business” other than the modules included in our systems we sold the majority of our solar modules to integrators and operators of systems in india and great britain  

from time to time we enter into module sales agreements with customers worldwide for specific projects or volumes of modules such agreements are generally shortterm in nature during 2015  11  and 8  of our components business net sales excluding modules installed in our pv solar power systems were denominated in british pounds and euros respectively and were subject to fluctuations in the exchange rate between such currencies and the us dollar 

under our standard sales contracts for solar modules we transfer title and risk of loss to the customer and recognize revenue upon shipment pricing is typically fixed or determinable at the time of shipment and our customers generally do not have extended payment terms or rights of return under these contracts our revenue recognition policies for the components business are described further in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2015  included in this annual report on form 10k 

during 2015  southern power company  strata solar llc  and nextera energy inc  each accounted for more than 10 of our components business’ net sales which includes the solar modules used in our systems projects 

systems business 

through our fully integrated systems business we provide complete turnkey pv solar power systems or solar solutions which may include project development epc services andor om services additionally we may temporarily own and operate certain of our pv solar power systems which are also included within our systems business we typically use the percentageofcompletion method using actual costs incurred over total estimated costs to construct a project including module costs as our standard accounting policy and apply this method after all revenue recognition criteria have been met there are also instances in which we recognize revenue after a project has been completed primarily due to a project not being sold prior to completion or because all revenue recognition criteria are not met until the project is completed our revenue recognition policies for the systems business are described in further detail in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2015  included in this annual report on form 10k 

during 2015  the majority of our systems business net sales were generated in north america and the principal customers of our systems business were nextera energy inc  and southern power company  each of which accounted for more than 10 of the segment’s net sales 

 54 

the following table shows net sales by reportable segment for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  



net sales from our components segment which includes solar modules used in our systems projects increased  by 2869 million  in 2015 primarily due to a 33 increase in the volume of watts sold partially offset by a 5 decrease in the average selling price per watt net sales from our systems segment which excludes solar modules used in our systems projects decreased  by 991 million  in 2015 primarily as a result of lower revenue from the completion or substantial completion of our desert sunlight solar gen 2 topaz and campo verde projects in 2014 these decreases were partially offset by the sale of majority interests in the partially constructed desert stateline project and north star project and higher revenue from our silver state south mccoy and imperial solar energy center west projects which commenced construction in late 2014 

net sales from our components segment which includes solar modules used in our systems projects decreased  by 713 million  in 2014 primarily due to a 12 decrease in the average selling price per watt partially offset by a 7 increase in the volume of watts sold net sales from our systems segment which excludes solar modules used in our systems projects increased  by 1528 million  in 2014 primarily as a result of the number and size of projects under construction between these periods as well as the timing of when all the revenue recognition criteria have been met specifically the increase was attributable to higher revenue from the partial sale of our solar gen 2 project the sale of our campo verde and macho springs projects and the commencement of construction and related revenue recognition on multiple projects in california and our agl nyngan project in australia these increases were partially offset by decreases in systems business project revenue from our desert sunlight project as it neared substantial completion our completed first phase of the imperial solar energy center south project and our completed amherstburg belmont walpole and agua caliente projects 

cost of sales   

components business 

our cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials and components for manufacturing solar modules such as glass transparent conductive coatings cadmium telluride and other thinfilm semiconductors laminate materials connector assemblies edge seal materials and other materials and components in addition our cost of sales includes direct labor for the manufacturing of solar modules and manufacturing overhead such as engineering equipment maintenance environmental health and safety quality and production control information technology and procurement costs our cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing plant and equipment facilityrelated expenses and costs associated with shipping warranties and our solar module collection and recycling obligation excluding accretion 

as further described in note 23   “segment and geographical information ”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2015  included within this annual report on form 10k we include the sale of our solar modules manufactured by our components business and used by our systems business within net sales of our components business therefore the related cost of sales is also included within our components business 

systems business 

for our systems business projectrelated costs include standard epc costs consisting primarily of bos costs for inverters electrical and mounting hardware project management and engineering costs and construction labor costs site specific costs and development costs including nonrefundable transmission upgrade costs interconnection fees and permitting costs 

 55 

the following table shows cost of sales by reportable segment for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  



our cost of sales increased   935 million  or 4  and decreased 14 percentage points  as a percentage of net sales when comparing 2015  with 2014  the increase  in cost of sales was driven by a 609 million   increase  in our systems segment cost of sales primarily due to a mix of lower gross profit system projects sold or under construction during the period our components segment cost of sales increased  by a 326 million  primarily as a result of the following 

 

our costs of sales increased   1213 million  or 5  and increased   18 percentage points  as a percentage of net sales when comparing 2014  with 2013  the increase  in cost of sales was primarily due to a 1975 million   increase  in our systems segment cost of sales primarily for bos components and other construction and development costs related to the number of projects and the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria were met along with a mix of higher cost projects these increases were partially offset by a 763 million  reduction in cost of sales for our components segment primarily due to the following 

 • lower inventory writeoff and asset impairment charges of 168 million partially offset by 

• higher costs of 679 million associated with increased solar module sales volumes and 

• a reduction in our module collection and recycling obligation of 433 million recorded during 2013 

gross profit 

gross profit  is affected by numerous factors including the selling prices of our modules and systems our manufacturing costs bos costs project development costs the capacity utilization of our manufacturing facilities and foreign exchange rates gross profit  is also affected by the mix of net sales generated by our components and systems businesses gross profit  for our systems business excludes the net sales and cost of sales for solar modules used in our systems projects as these amounts are included in the gross profit of our components business 

the following table shows gross profit for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  



  

gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased  by 14 percentage points  during 2015  compared with 2014  primarily due to a reduction in our module collection and recycling obligation and improved utilization of our manufacturing facilities gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased  by 18 percentage point during 2014  compared with 2013  primarily due to a mix of lower gross profit projects sold and under construction in 2014 and an adjustment for lower estimated recycling costs recorded in 2013 these decreases in gross profit were partially offset by favorable changes in estimated costs on systems projects accounted for under the percentageofcompletion method a lower volume of thirdparty module net sales which generally have margins less than systems business projects and improved utilization of our manufacturing facilities 

  

 56 

research and development 

research and development  expense consists primarily of salaries and personnelrelated costs the cost of products materials and outside services used in our process and product research and development activities for both the components and systems businesses and depreciation and amortization expense associated with research and development specific facilities and equipment the majority of our research and development expense is attributable to our components segment we maintain a number of programs and activities to improve our technology and processes in order to enhance the performance and reduce the costs of our solar modules and pv solar power systems using our modules 

the following table shows research and development expense for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  



the decrease  in our research and development expense during 2015  compared to 2014  was primarily due to reduced material and module testing costs associated with the development of nextgeneration cdte solar modules and lower costs for outside services partially offset by higher employee compensation expense during 2015  the average conversion efficiency of our cdte solar modules produced was 156  compared to 140  in 2014  

the increase  in our research and development expense during 2014  compared to 2013  was primarily attributable to additional costs related to the development of our nextgeneration cdte solar modules our joint collaboration agreement with ge to further advance our cdte solar technology and higher employee compensation costs during 2014  the average conversion efficiency of our cdte solar modules was 140  compared to 132  in 2013  

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative  expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated costs professional fees insurance costs travel expenses and other business development and selling expenses our components and systems businesses each have their own dedicated administrative key functions such as accounting legal finance project finance human resources procurement and marketing costs for these functions are recorded and included within selling general and administrative expense of the respective segment our key corporate support functions consist primarily of companywide tax treasury accounting legal finance investor relations information technology communications government relations and executive management these corporate functions and the assets supporting such functions benefit both the components and systems segments we allocate corporate costs to the components and systems segments as part of selling general and administrative costs based upon the estimated benefits provided to each segment from these corporate functions we determine the estimated benefits provided to each segment for these corporate costs based upon a combination of the estimated time spent by corporate employees supporting each segment and the average relative selling general and administrative costs incurred by each segment before such corporate allocations 

the following table shows selling general and administrative expense for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  



our selling general and administrative expenses increased  by 14 million  or 1  and were 71  and 75  as a percentage of net sales when comparing 2015  with 2014  respectively the increase was mainly attributable to higher employee compensation expense and higher professional fees associated with the initial public offering of 8point3 energy partners lp partially offset by lower project development expense and lower accretion expense associated with the reduction in our module collection and recycling obligation 

 57 

our selling general and administrative expenses decreased  by 164 million  or 6  and were 75  and 82  as a percentage of net sales when comparing 2014  with 2013  respectively the most significant items affecting our selling general and administrative costs during 2014  and 2013  are as follows 

 

  production startup   

production startup  expense consists primarily of employee compensation and other costs associated with operating a production line before it has been qualified for full production including the cost of raw materials for solar modules run through the production line during the qualification phase costs related to equipment upgrades and implementation of manufacturing process improvements are also included in production startup expense as well as costs related to the selection of a new site including related legal and regulatory costs and costs to maintain our plant replication program to the extent we cannot capitalize these expenditures in general we expect production startup expense per production line to be higher when we build an entirely new manufacturing facility compared with the addition of new production lines at an existing manufacturing facility primarily due to the additional infrastructure investment required when building an entirely new facility production startup expense is attributable to our components segment 

the following table shows production startup expense for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  



during 2015  and 2014  our production startup expense related to the commencement of our tetrasun operations at our manufacturing facility in kulim malaysia our tetrasun operations involve the manufacturing of crystalline silicon solar modules with proprietary highpower density monocrystalline technology these production startup activities commenced during the third quarter of 2014  during 2015  we also incurred startup expenses related to a manufacturing line at our facility in perrysburg ohio production startup expense for 2013  was primarily for global manufacturing personnel dedicated to plant expansion new equipment installations equipment upgrades and process improvements for both new and existing plants 

restructuring and asset impairments 

restructuring and asset impairment expense includes those expenses incurred related to material restructuring initiatives and includes severance and employee termination costs that are directly related to such restructuring initiatives costs associated with contract terminations and other restructuring related costs these restructuring initiatives are intended to align the organization with current business conditions and to reduce costs 

the following table shows restructuring and asset impairment expense for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  



 58 

during 2013  our restructuring and asset impairment expense included 52 million related to restructuring initiatives associated with the closure of our german manufacturing plants and our decision not to move forward with our previously planned fourline manufacturing plant in vietnam additionally during 2013  we recorded an asset impairment charge of 565 million  related to the agreement to sell our mesa arizona facility and an additional 252 million  impairment charge to adjust the carrying value of our plant in vietnam the effect of these asset impairments reduced the book values of both our mesa arizona facility and vietnam plant to their respective fair values less costs to sell see note 4 “asset impairments”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2015  included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

foreign currency loss gain net   

foreign currency loss gain net  consists of the net effect of gains and losses resulting from holding assets and liabilities and conducting transactions denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries’ functional currencies 

the following table shows foreign currency loss gain net for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  



foreign currency loss increased during 2015  compared with 2014  the increase was primarily due to differences between our economic hedge positions and the underlying exposures along with changes in foreign currency rates which included the strengthening of the us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies foreign currency loss increased during 2014  compared with 2013  primarily due to differences between our economic hedge positions and the underlying exposure along with changes in foreign currency rates 

interest income 

interest income  is earned on our cash cash equivalents marketable securities and restricted cash and investments interest income also includes interest earned from notes receivable and late customer payments 

the following table shows interest income for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  



interest income during 2015   increased  compared to 2014  primarily as a result of higher average balances of notes receivable due from affiliates interest income during 2014  was consistent with 2013  

interest expense net   

interest expense is incurred on various debt financings we capitalize interest expense into our project assets or property plant and equipment when such costs qualify for interest capitalization which reduces the amount of net interest expense reported in any given period 

the following table shows interest expense net for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  



interest expense net of amounts capitalized increased in 2015  compared to 2014  primarily as a result of higher levels of project specific debt financings interest expense net of amounts capitalized during 2014  was consistent with 2013  

 59 

other expense net 

other expense net  is primarily comprised of miscellaneous items amounts excluded from hedge effectiveness and realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities 

the following table shows other expense net for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  



other expense net  in 2015  was consistent with other expense net in 2014  and 2013  

income before taxes and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates   

the following table shows income before taxes and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  



components segment income before taxes increased  by 2773 million  during 2015  compared to 2014  primarily due to the increase in net sales resulting from higher volumes of module sold as part of systems projects the reduction in our module collection and recycling obligation improved utilization of our manufacturing assets and lower selling general and administrative expense systems segment income before income taxes decreased  by 1896 million  during 2015  compared to 2014  primarily as a result of the decrease in net sales a mix of lower gross profit systems projects sold or under construction during the period and higher selling general and administrative expense 

components segment loss before income taxes decreased  by 1157 million  during 2014  compared to 2013  primarily due to lower restructuring and asset impairment charges related to the sale of our facility in mesa arizona and a decrease in selling general and administrative expense mainly driven by less depreciation and amortization expense for certain leasehold improvements and our mesa facility these reductions were partially offset by a reduction in our module collection and recycling obligation recorded during 2013 systems segment income before income taxes decreased   646 million  during 2014  compared to 2013  primarily as a result of a mix of lower gross profit systems projects sold and under construction in 2014 and higher selling general and administrative expense these items were partially offset by favorable changes in estimated costs on systems projects accounted for under the percentageofcompletion method 

income tax benefit expense 

income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect our best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions in which we operate principally australia germany and malaysia significant judgments and estimates are required in determining our consolidated income tax expense in malaysia we have been granted a longterm tax holiday scheduled to expire in 2027  pursuant to which substantially all of our income earned in malaysia is exempt from income tax 

the following table shows income tax benefit expense for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  



 60 

income tax expense decreased by 373 million  during 2015  compared to 2014  the decrease in income tax expense was primarily the result of a 417 million  discrete tax benefit associated with the receipt of a private letter ruling during the period see note 20 “income taxes”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2015  included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

income tax expense increased by 11 million  during 2014  compared with 2013  the increase in income tax expense was primarily attributable to an increase in pretax book income earned in higher tax jurisdictions in 2014 partially offset by a discrete tax benefit due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for various uncertain tax positions see note 20 “income taxes”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2015  included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates net of tax   

equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates net of tax represents our proportionate share of the earnings and losses of unconsolidated affiliates with whom we have made equity method investments 

the following table shows equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates net of tax for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  



equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates net of tax increased during 2015  compared to 2014  primarily as a result of our investment in 8point3 operating company llc a subsidiary of 8point3 energy partners lp along with the impairments of certain investments during 2014  losses from unconsolidated affiliates increased during 2014  compared to 2013  primarily due to the impairments of certain investments 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2015  we believe that our cash cash equivalents marketable securities cash flows from operating activities including the contracted portion of our advancedstage project pipeline availability under our revolving credit facility considering minimum liquidity covenant requirements and access to the capital markets will be sufficient to meet our working capital systems project investment and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months we monitor our working capital to ensure we have adequate liquidity both domestically and internationally additionally we have an active shelf registration statement filed with the sec for the issuance of debt or equity securities if needed 

we intend to maintain appropriate debt levels based upon cash flow expectations our overall cost of capital and expected cash requirements for operations capital expenditures and discretionary strategic spending in the future we may also engage in additional debt or equity financings including project specific debt financings we believe that when necessary we will have adequate access to the capital markets although our ability to raise capital on terms commercially acceptable to us could be constrained if there is insufficient lender or investor interest due to industrywide or companyspecific concerns such financings could result in increased debt service expenses or dilution to our existing stockholders 

as of december 31 2015  we had 18 billion  in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities compared with 20 billion  as of december 31 2014  cash cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december 31 2015  decreased primarily as the result of financing the construction of certain solar power projects as of december 31 2015  and 2014  15 billion  and 14 billion  respectively of our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and were generally based in us dollar and euro denominated holdings we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed 

our expanding systems business requires liquidity and is expected to continue to have significant liquidity requirements in the future the net amount of our project assets deferred project costs billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings and payments and billings for deferred project costs which approximates our net capital investment in the development and construction of systems projects as of december 31 2015  was 12 billion  solar power project development and construction cycles which span the time between the identification of a site location and the commercial operation of a system vary substantially and can take many years to mature as a result of these long project cycles and strategic decisions to finance the construction of certain projects we may need to make significant upfront investments of resources in advance of the receipt of any cash from the sale 

 61 

of such projects these upfront investments may include using our working capital the availability under our revolving credit facility or entering into project financing arrangements to finance the construction of our systems projects for example we may have to complete or substantially complete the construction of a systems project before such project is sold delays in construction progress or in completing the sale of our systems projects that we are selffinancing may also impact our liquidity we have historically financed these upfront systems project investments primarily using working capital in certain circumstances we may need to finance construction costs exclusively using working capital if project financing becomes unavailable due to marketwide regional or other concerns 

we are partnering with local developers on project development in markets around the world where we may take an equity stake in a project for a number of years we are also selfdeveloping projects in such markets where we may hold all or a significant portion of the equity in the projects for several years given the duration of these investments and the currency risk relative to the us dollar in some of these new markets we continue to explore local financing alternatives should these financing alternatives be unavailable or too cost prohibitive we could be exposed to significant currency risk and our liquidity could be adversely impacted 

additionally we may elect to retain an ownership interest in certain systems projects after they become operational if we determine it would be of economic and strategic benefit to do so if for example we cannot sell a systems project at economics that are attractive to us or potential customers are unwilling to assume the risks and rewards typical of pv solar power system ownership we may instead elect to temporarily own and operate such systems until we can sell the systems on economically attractive terms as with traditional electricity generating assets the selling price of a pv solar power system could be higher at or postcompletion to reflect the elimination of construction and performance risks and other uncertainties the decision to retain ownership of a system impacts liquidity depending upon the size and cost of the project as of december 31 2015  we had 937 million  of pv solar power systems that have been placed in service we may elect to enter into temporary or longterm project financing to reduce the impact on our liquidity and working capital we also formed a limited partnership yieldco vehicle described under “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – certain trends and uncertainties – 8point3 energy partners lp” and may consider entering into tax equity or other arrangements with respect to ownership interests in certain of our projects which could cause a portion of the economics of such projects to be recognized over time 

the following additional considerations have impacted or may impact our liquidity in 2016  and beyond

our liquidity or require us to pursue additional sources of financing assuming such sources are available to us   additionally we have elected and may in the future elect or be required to temporarily retain a noncontrolling ownership interest in certain underlying systems projects we develop supply modules to or construct any such retained ownership interest is expected to impact our liquidity to the extent we do not obtain new sources of capital to fund such investments 

 

 

global sovereign debt problems and their impact on the balance sheets and lending practices of global banks such as the disruption in the credit markets during and after the 2008 financial crisis could negatively impact our access to and cost of capital and therefore could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and competitive position such problems could also similarly affect our customers and therefore limit the demand for our systems projects or solar modules as of december 31 2015  our liquidity marketable securities and restricted investments have not been materially adversely impacted by the current credit environment and we believe that they will not be materially adversely impacted in the near future we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity and the credit markets however we cannot predict with any certainty the impact to us of any further disruption in the current credit environment 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  in thousands 



operating activities 

the decrease in cash provided by operating activities during 2015  was primarily driven by the increase in project assets and deferred project costs resulting from our financing the construction of certain projects with our working capital and increases in our trade accounts receivable the decrease in cash provided by operating activities during 2014  was primarily attributable to the timing of cash received from customers for the sale of certain systems projects 

investing activities 

the decrease in cash used in investing activities during 2015  was driven by the receipt of 2390 million from the initial public offering of 8point3 energy partners lp changes in our restricted cash balance and lower purchases of property plant and equipment the effects of these items were partially offset by net purchases of marketable securities of 2031 million  during 2015 compared to 775 million  during 2014 the decrease in cash used in investing activities during 2014 was primarily due to changes in our restricted cash balance lower proceeds from sales of property plant and equipment and certain investments in affiliate notes receivable the effects of these items were partially offset by net purchases of marketable securities of 775 million  during 2014 compared to 3410 million  during 2013 

 63 

financing activities 

cash provided by financing activities during 2015  resulted primarily from 1460 million  of proceeds from borrowings under our project construction credit facilities in chile japan and india and 447 million  of proceeds from the leaseback financing associated with the maryland solar project partially offset by 471 million  of payments on longterm debt cash provided by financing activities during 2014  resulted primarily from 656 million  of proceeds from borrowings under our project construction credit facilities in chile partially offset by 601 million  of payments on longterm debt cash provided by financing activities during 2013  was primarily driven by proceeds from our june 2013 equity offering of 4282 million  partially offset by net payments on our revolving credit facility of 2700 million  and 650 million  of payments on longterm debt 

contractual obligations 

the following table presents our contractual obligations as of december 31 2015  in thousands which consists of legal commitments requiring us to make fixed or determinable cash payments we purchase raw materials for inventory construction materials various services and manufacturing equipment from a variety of vendors during the normal course of business in order to manage manufacturing and construction lead times and help assure an adequate supply of certain items we enter into agreements with suppliers that either allow us to procure goods and services when we choose or that establish purchase requirements over the term of the agreement 



 

 

 

 

 

in addition to the amounts shown in the table above we have recorded 1418 million  of unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with accounting standards codification “asc” 740 income taxes  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 

 64 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet debt or similar obligations other than financial assurance related instruments and operating leases that are not classified as debt we do not guarantee any thirdparty debt see note 15 “commitments and contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2015  included in this annual report on form 10k for further information about our financial assurance related instruments 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 3 “recent accounting pronouncements”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2015  included in this annual report on form 10k for a summary of recent accounting pronouncements 

critical accounting estimates 

in preparing our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of reported assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in the selection of the appropriate assumptions for making these estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty we base our judgments and estimates on our historical experience our forecasts and other available information as appropriate our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2015  included in this annual report on form 10k our critical accounting estimates which require the most significant management estimates and judgment in determining the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k are as follows 

revenue recognition – systems business  we recognize revenue for arrangements entered into by our systems business generally using two revenue recognition models following the guidance in either asc 60535 constructiontype and productiontype contracts    or asc 36020 real estate sales for arrangements which include land or land rights 

systems business sales arrangements in which we construct a pv solar power system for a specific customer on land that is controlled by the customer and has not been previously controlled by first solar are accounted for under asc 60535 for such sales arrangements we use the percentageofcompletion method as described further below using actual costs incurred over total estimated costs to develop and construct the system including module costs as our standard accounting policy 

systems business sales arrangements in which we convey control of land or land rights as part of the transaction are accounted for under asc 36020 accordingly we use one of the following revenue recognition methods based upon an evaluation of the substance and form of the terms and conditions of such real estate sales 

 

 

for any systems business sales arrangements containing multiple deliverables including our solar modules not required to be accounted for under asc 60535 longterm construction contracts or asc 36020 real estate we analyze each activity within the sales arrangement to adhere to the separation guidelines of asc 60525 for multipleelement arrangements we allocate revenue for any transactions involving multiple elements to each unit of accounting based on its relative selling price and recognize revenue for each unit of accounting when all revenue recognition criteria for a unit of accounting have been met 

 65 

our system business sales arrangements within the scope of asc 36020 involve a range of standard product warranties which include limited solar module warranties limited bos warranties and system energy performance testing each standard product warranty program represents a risk of the module manufacturer or system epc contractor and is not an obligation or risk of a system owner these programs do not represent any guarantee of energy output and relate to the underlying performance of the system assets consequently our product warranty programs do not represent any guarantees of cash flows related to the systems and we have not assumed any of the risks and rewards of ownership with respect to such programs separately our systems customers may also engage us to provide om services which would typically include an effective availability guarantee our availability guarantees are an incremental offering within separate arrangements for om services availability guarantees are guarantees of our own service performance and do not represent guarantees of a system’s output or cash flows accordingly our product warranties and market based service contracts are not forms of continuing involvement that would indicate that substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership have not been transferred to the system owner 

revenue recognition – percentageofcompletion in applying the percentageofcompletion method we use the actual costs incurred relative to the total estimated costs including module costs in order to determine the progress towards completion and calculate the corresponding amount of revenue and profit to recognize costs incurred include direct materials solar modules labor subcontractor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance such as indirect labor and supplies we recognize direct material and solar module costs as incurred when the direct materials and solar modules have been installed in the project when contracts specify that title to direct materials and solar modules transfers to the customer before installation has been performed we will not recognize revenue or the associated costs until those materials are installed and have met all other revenue recognition requirements we consider direct materials and solar modules to be installed when they are permanently placed or affixed to a pv solar power system as required by engineering designs solar modules manufactured and owned by us that will be used in our systems remain within inventory until such modules are installed in a system 

the percentageofcompletion method of revenue recognition requires us to make estimates of net contract revenues and costs to complete our projects in making such estimates management judgments are required to evaluate significant assumptions including the amount of net contract revenues the cost of materials and labor expected labor productivity the impact of potential variances in schedule completion and the impact of any penalties claims change orders or performance incentives 

if estimated total costs on any contract are greater than the net contract revenues we recognize the entire estimated loss in the period the loss becomes known the cumulative effect of the revisions to estimates related to net contract revenues and costs to complete contracts including penalties claims change orders performance incentives anticipated losses and others are recorded in the period in which the revisions to estimates are identified and the amounts can be reasonably estimated the effect of the changes on future periods are recognized as if the revised estimates had been used since revenue was initially recognized under the contract such revisions could occur in any reporting period and the effects may be material depending on the size of the contracts or the changes in estimates 

accrued solar module collection and recycling liability at the time of sale we record our collection and recycling obligation based on the estimated cost to collect and recycle the covered solar modules we estimate the cost of our collection and recycling obligations based on the present value of the expected probability weighted future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules which includes estimates for the cost of packaging materials the cost of freight from the solar module installation sites to a recycling center the material labor capital costs and scale of recycling centers and an estimated thirdparty profit margin and return on risk for collection and recycling services we base these estimates on i our experience collecting and recycling our solar modules ii the expected timing of when our solar modules will be returned for recycling and iii expected economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled in the periods between the time of sale and the related settlement of the collection and recycling obligation we accrete the carrying amount of the associated liability by applying the discount rate used for its initial measurement we periodically review our estimates of expected future recycling costs and may adjust our liability accordingly 

during the year ended december 31 2015  we completed our annual cost study of obligations under our module collection and recycling program based on newly implemented recycling technologies at our manufacturing facility in perrysburg ohio and reduced our associated liability by 800 million  the new recycling technology represents a significant improvement over previous technologies and contains a continuous flow recycling process which increases the throughput of modules able to be recycled at a point in time such process improvements also result in corresponding reductions in capital chemical labor maintenance and other general recycling costs which further contribute to the reduction in the recycling rate per module and corresponding change in the liability at december 31 2015  our estimated liability for collecting and recycling solar modules covered by our collection and recycling program was 1634 million  a 1 increase in the annualized inflation rate used in our estimated future collection and recycling cost per module would increase our liability by 367 million  and a 1 decrease in that rate would decrease our liability by 307 million  

 66 

product warranties and accrued expense in excess of product warranties  we provide a limited pv solar module warranty covering defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for 10  years following the transfer of title to our modules we also typically warrant that modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 97  of their labeled power output rating during the first year with the warranty coverage reducing by 07  every year thereafter throughout the 25year performance warranty period prior to 2014 we warranted that modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications would produce at least 90  of their labeled power output rating during the first 10 years following installation and at least 80  of their labeled power output rating during the following 15 years in resolving claims under both the defect and power output warranties we have the option of either repairing or replacing the covered modules or under the power output warranty providing additional modules to remedy the power shortfall we also have the option to make a payment for the then current market price of modules to resolve the claims such limited module warranties are standard for module sales and are automatically transferred from the original purchasers of the solar modules to subsequent purchasers upon resale 

as an alternative form of our standard limited module power output warranty we also offer an aggregated or system level limited module performance warranty this system level limited module performance warranty is designed for utilityscale systems and provides 25 year system level energy degradation protection in addition this warranty represents a practical expedient to address the challenge of identifying from the potential millions of modules installed in a utilityscale system individual modules that may be performing below warranty thresholds by focusing on the aggregate energy generated by the system rather than the power output of individual modules the system level module performance warranty typically is calculated as a percentage of a system’s expected energy production adjusted for certain actual site conditions with the warranted level of performance declining each year in a linear fashion but never falling below 80  during the term of the warranty in resolving claims under the system level limited module performance warranty to restore the system to warranted performance levels we first must validate that the root cause of the issue is due to module performance we then have the option of either repairing or replacing the covered modules providing supplemental modules or making a cash payment consistent with our limited module power output warranty when we elect to satisfy a warranty claim by providing replacement or supplemental modules under the system level module performance warranty we do not have any obligation to pay for the labor to remove or install modules 

in addition to our limited solar module warranty described above for pv solar power systems built by us we typically provide a limited product warranty on bos parts for defects in engineering design installation and workmanship for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a system in resolving claims under such bos warranties we have the option of remedying the defect through repair or replacement 

when we recognize revenue for module or systems sales we accrue liabilities for the estimated future costs of meeting our limited warranty obligations we make and revise these estimates based primarily on the number of our solar modules under warranty installed at customer locations our historical experience with warranty claims our monitoring of field installation sites our internal testing of and the expected future performance of our solar modules and bos components and our estimated permodule replacement costs 

we may also accrue expenses for the cost of any voluntary remediation programs beyond our normal product warranty our estimates for such remediation programs are based on an evaluation of available information including the estimated number of potentially affected solar modules historical experience related to our remediation efforts customerprovided data related to potentially affected systems estimated costs for performing removal replacement and logistical services and any postsale expenses covered under our voluntary remediation program if any of our estimates prove incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses 

at december 31 2015  our accrued liabilities for product warranties and accrued expense in excess of product warranties were 2318 million  and 246 million  respectively we have historically estimated our product warranty liability for power output and defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions to have an estimated warranty return rate of approximately 3  of modules covered under warranty a 1  change in the estimated warranty return rate would change our estimated product warranty liability by 715 million  and a 1  change in the estimated warranty return rate for bos components would not have a material impact on the associated warranty liability 

 67 

performance guarantees  for systems sales arrangements we also conduct performance testing of a system prior to substantial completion to confirm the system meets its operational and capacity expectations noted in the epc agreement in addition we may provide an energy performance test during the first year of a system’s operation to demonstrate that the actual energy generation for the first year meets or exceeds the modeled energy expectation after certain adjustments these tests are based on meteorological energy and equipment performance data measured at the system’s location as well as certain projections of such data over the remaining measurement period if there is an underperformance event with regards to these tests we may incur liquidated damages as a percentage of the epc contract price if necessary we accrue estimates for liquidated damages at the end of each reporting period based on our performance testing in certain instances a bonus payment may be received at the end of the first year if the system performs above a specified level 

as part of our om service offerings we typically offer an effective availability guarantee which stipulates that a system will be available to generate a certain percentage of total possible energy during a specific period after adjusting for factors outside of our control as the service provider such as weather curtailment outages force majeure and other conditions that may affect system availability effective availability guarantees are only offered as part of our om services and terminate at the end of an om arrangement these guarantees are based on meteorological energy and equipment performance data measured at the system’s location as well as certain projections of such data over the remaining measurement period if we fail to meet the contractual threshold for these guarantees we may incur liquidated damages for certain lost energy under the ppa if necessary we accrue estimates for liquidated damages at the end of each reporting period based on our effective availability calculations conversely many of our om agreements contain provisions whereby we may receive a bonus payment if system availability exceeds a separate threshold 

accounting for income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the united states and its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining our provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit we regularly evaluate the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and future examinations and we record tax liabilities as appropriate 

we establish liabilities for potential additional taxes based on our assessment of the outcome of our tax positions once established we adjust the liabilities when additional information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring an adjustment significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the actual cost of a tax assessment fine or penalty may ultimately be materially different from our recorded liabilities if any 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements we calculate our income tax expense based on our interpretation of the tax laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business this requires us to estimate our current tax obligations assess uncertain tax positions and assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 

we must also assess the likelihood that each of our deferred tax assets will be realized to the extent we believe that realization of any of our deferred tax assets is not more likely than not we establish a valuation allowance when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a reporting period we generally record a corresponding tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations conversely to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed which generally reduces our overall income tax expense 

we also consider the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and determine whether such amounts are indefinitely reinvested accordingly no additional us or nonus taxes have been accrued that may be incurred if such amounts were repatriated to the united states we have concluded that except for the earnings of our canadian subsidiary and with respect to previously taxed income all such accumulated earnings are currently indefinitely reinvested or that if upon repatriation no additional us or nonus tax would be due if our intention to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries changes additional us and nonus taxes may be required to be accrued see note 20 “income taxes”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2015  included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

 68 

we continually explore initiatives to better align our tax and legal entity structure with the footprint of our nonus operations and recognize the tax impact of these initiatives including changes in the assessment of uncertain tax positions indefinite reinvestment exception assertions and the realizability of deferred tax assets in the period when we believe all necessary internal and external approvals associated with such initiatives have been obtained or when the initiatives are materially complete it is possible that the completion of one or more of these initiatives may occur within the next 12 months 

longlived asset impairment  we are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of longlived assets including property plant and equipment pv solar power systems and project assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified we review our longlived assets each reporting period to assess whether impairment indicators are present and we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event indicating potential impairment has occurred for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss a longlived asset is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and we must exercise judgment in assessing such groupings and levels 

for longlived assets when impairment indicators are present we compare undiscounted future cash flows including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value to the asset group’s carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable this assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the assets to be held and used assessments also consider changes in asset group utilization including the temporary idling of capacity and the expected timing of placing the capacity back into production 

for an asset group that fails the test of recoverability described above the estimated fair value of longlived assets may be determined using an income approach market approach cost approach or a combination of one or more of these approaches as appropriate for the particular asset group being reviewed all of these approaches start with the forecast of expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of the longlived assets we also utilize thirdparty valuations and information available regarding the current market for similar assets if there is an impairment a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the asset group’s fair value and carrying value prior to impairment this may require judgment in estimating future cash flows relevant discount rates and residual values applied in the income approach used in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used 

goodwill  goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the estimated fair value assigned to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed we do not amortize goodwill but instead are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually we perform impairment tests between scheduled annual tests in the fourth quarter if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill is less than its carrying value 

  

we may first make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test the qualitative impairment test considers various factors including macroeconomic conditions industry and market considerations cost factors the overall financial performance of a reporting unit and any other relevant events affecting the entity or its reporting units if we determine through the qualitative assessment that a reporting unit’s fair value is more likely than not greater than its carrying value the twostep impairment test is not required if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value we must perform the twostep impairment test we may also elect to proceed directly to the twostep impairment test without considering such qualitative factors 

the first step in a twostep impairment test is the comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill our reporting units consist of our fully integrated systems business cdte module manufacturing business and our crystalline silicon module manufacturing business from our tetrasun acquisition in 2013 in accordance with the authoritative guidance over fair value measurements we define the fair value of a reporting unit as the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date we primarily use the income approach methodology of valuation which includes the discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair values of our reporting units 

significant management judgment is required when estimating the fair value of our reporting units including the forecasting of future operating results and the selection of discount and expected future growth rates that we use in determining the projected cash flows if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is not impaired and no further analysis is required 

 69 

if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value in the first step then we are required to perform the second step of the impairment test in this step we assign the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in step one to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if a market participant just acquired the reporting unit in a business combination the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in the first step of the impairment test over the total amount assigned to the assets and liabilities in the second step of the impairment test represents the implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference if there is no such excess then all goodwill for a reporting unit is considered impaired 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our primary foreign currency exposures are cash flow exposure transaction exposure and earnings translation exposure 

cash flow exposure  we expect many of our subsidiaries to have material future cash flows that will be denominated in currencies other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies changes in the exchange rates between the functional currencies of our subsidiaries and the other currencies in which they transact will cause fluctuations in the cash flows we expect to receive or pay when these cash flows are realized or settled accordingly we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of these forecasted cash flows these foreign exchange forward contracts qualify for accounting as cash flow hedges in accordance with asc 815 and we designated them as such we initially report the effective portion of a derivative’s unrealized gain or loss in “accumulated other comprehensive income” and subsequently reclassify amounts into earnings when the hedged transaction occurs and impacts earnings 

our operations in malaysia pay a portion of their operating expenses such as associate wages and utilities in malaysian ringgit exposing us to foreign currency exchange risk for those malaysian ringgit expenses as we expand into new markets worldwide particularly emerging markets our total foreign currency exchange risk in terms of both size and exchange rate volatility and the number of foreign currencies we are exposed to could increase significantly 

for additional details on our derivative hedging instruments and activities refer to note 10 “derivative financial instruments”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2015  included in this annual report on form 10k 

our international customers accounted for 13  of our net sales during the year ended december 31 2015  of which 40  of these international net sales were denominated in australian dollars our international customers accounted for 10  and 14  of our net sales during the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively of which 25  and 38  of these international net sales respectively were denominated in euro as a result we have exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to our net sales fluctuations in exchange rates particularly in the us dollar to australian dollar us dollar to euro and us dollar to malaysian ringgit affect our gross profit and could result in foreign exchange and operating losses in the past most of our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk has related to currency gains and losses between the time we sign and settle our sales contracts denominated in australian dollars and euros for the year ended december 31 2015  a 10 change in the us dollar to australian dollar exchange rate would have impacted our net sales by 186 million  excluding the effect of our hedging activities during the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  a 10 change in the us dollar to euro exchange rate would have impacted our net sales by 88 million  and 183 million  respectively excluding the effect of our hedging activities 

transaction exposure many of our subsidiaries have assets and liabilities primarily cash receivables marketable securities payables debt and solar module collection and recycling liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies changes in the exchange rates between the functional currencies of our subsidiaries and the other currencies in which these assets and liabilities are denominated will create fluctuations in our reported consolidated statements of operations and cash flows we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other financial instruments to economically hedge assets and liabilities against the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations the gains and losses on such foreign exchange forward contracts will economically offset all or part of the transaction gains and losses that we recognize in earnings on the related foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 

for additional details on our economic hedging instruments and activities refer to note 10 “derivative financial instruments”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2015  included in this annual report on form 10k 

 70 

if the us dollar weakened by 10 against the chinese yuan singapore dollar and vietnamese dong we would have incurred an additional 45 million  in foreign currency losses for the year ended december 31 2015  

earnings translation exposure  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to translate the financial statements of our subsidiaries that do not have a us dollar functional currency we do not hedge translation exposure at this time but may in the future decide to purchase forward exchange contracts or other instruments to offset this impact from currency fluctuations 

in the past currency exchange rate fluctuations have had an impact on our business and results of operations for example currency exchange rate fluctuations impacted our cash flows by 193 million  unfavorable 195 million  unfavorable and 36 million  favorable for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively although we cannot predict the impact of future currency exchange rate fluctuations on our business or results of operations we believe that we will continue to have risk associated with currency exchange rate fluctuations in the future 

interest rate risk 

our primary interest rate risks relate to our outstanding variable rate debt our system sales prices from the effect of interest rates on our customers’ financing of such systems and our investments in marketable securities and restricted investments 

variable rate debt exposure we are exposed to interest rate risk because our revolving credit facility malaysian ringgit facility agreement malaysian euro facility agreement the floating rate portion of our malaysian facility agreement and various project construction credit facilities have variable interest rates exposing us to variability in interest expense and cash flows we use interest rate and crosscurrency swap contracts to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated with a portion of our variable rate debt instruments we have interest rate swap contracts in place to mitigate the interest rate risk for the floating rate portion of our malaysian facility agreement we also have a crosscurrency swap contract in place to mitigate the interest rate risk of our malaysian ringgit facility agreement for additional details on our derivative hedging instruments and activities refer to note 10 “derivative financial instruments”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2015  included in this annual report on form 10k 

an increase in the euro interbank offered rate “euribor” would impact our cost of borrowing under our malaysian euro facility agreement  an increase in the prime rate or london interbank offered rate “libor” would impact our cost of borrowing under our revolving credit facility  and an increase in tokyo interbank offered rate “tibor” or equivalent variable rates would impact our cost of borrowings under our project construction credit facilities if these variable rates changed by 100 basis points our interest cost for the year ended december 31 2015  would have changed by 03 million  including the effect of our hedging activities 

effect of interest rates on our customers’ financing of systems  we are exposed to interest rate risk because many of our systems business customers depend on debt financing to purchase a pv solar power system from us although the useful life of a pv solar power system is considered to be approximately 25 years owners of our systems must pay the entire cost of the system by the time such system is completed as a result many of our customers rely on debt financing to fund their upfront capital expenditures an increase in interest rates available to finance such purchases could make it difficult for our customers to secure the financing and underlying interest rate necessary to purchase a system such factors could lower demand or the price we can charge for our systems and reduce our net sales and gross profit in addition we believe that a significant percentage of our customers purchase systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt an increase in interest rates could lower an investor’s return on investment in a system or make alternative investments more attractive relative to solar power systems which in each case could cause these endusers to seek alternative investments that promise higher returns 

investments in marketable securities and restricted investments exposure  we invest in various debt securities which exposes us to interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and provide liquidity while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the market value of the investment to fluctuate for example if we hold a security that was issued with an interest rate fixed at the thenprevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises the market value of our investment may decline 

to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investments in marketable securities and restricted investments we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investments assuming a 100 basis point change in interest rates during 2015  our marketable securities earned a pretax yield of less than 1  and had a weighted average maturity of 17 months  as of december 31 2015  based on our investment 

 71 

positions as of december 31 2015  a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in a 91 million  change in the market value of our investment portfolio as of december 31 2014  a similar 100 basis point change in interest rates would have resulted in a 37 million  change in the market value of our investment portfolio as of december 31 2015  our marketable securities were comprised of foreign debt and time deposits  

during 2015  our restricted investments earned a pretax yield of 2  and had a weighted average maturity of approximately 19  years as of december 31 2015  based on our investment positions as of december 31 2015  a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in a 609 million  change in the market value of our restricted investment portfolio as of december 31 2014  a similar 100 basis point change in interest rates would have resulted in a 744 million  change in the market value of our restricted investment portfolio as of december 31 2015  all of our restricted investments were in foreign and us government obligations 

commodity and component risk 

we are exposed to price risks for the raw materials components and energy costs used in the manufacturing and transportation of our solar modules and bos parts used in pv solar power systems also some of our raw materials and components are sourced from a limited number of suppliers or a single supplier we endeavor to qualify multiple suppliers using a robust qualification process in some cases we also enter into longterm supply contracts for raw materials and components as a result we remain exposed to price changes in the raw materials and components used in our solar modules in addition the failure of a key supplier could disrupt our supply chain which could result in higher prices andor a disruption in our manufacturing or construction processes we may be unable to pass along changes in the cost of the raw materials and components for our products and systems to our customers and may be in default of our delivery obligations if we experience a manufacturing or construction disruption 

credit risk 

we have certain financial and derivative instruments that subject us to credit risk these consist primarily of cash cash equivalents marketable securities restricted cash and investments trade accounts receivable notes receivable interest rate swap and crosscurrency swap contracts and foreign exchange forward contracts we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial and derivative instruments we place cash cash equivalents marketable securities restricted cash and investments interest rate swap and crosscurrency swap contracts and foreign exchange forward contracts with various highquality financial institutions and limit the amount of credit risk from any one counterparty we continuously evaluate the credit standing of our counterparty financial institutions our net sales are primarily concentrated among a limited number of customers we monitor the financial condition of our customers and perform credit evaluations whenever considered necessary depending upon the sales arrangement we may require some form of payment security from our customers including bank guarantees or commercial letters of credit

 item 9a controls and procedures 

a evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain “disclosure controls and procedures” as such term is defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that disclosure controls and procedures no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met additionally in designing disclosure controls and procedures our management was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures the design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 

based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of that date

b management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate “internal control over financial reporting” as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2015  based on the criteria established in internal control – integrated framework 2013  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 

based on the results of our evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2015  

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2015  has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in its report which appears herein 

c changes in internal control over financial reporting 

we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of our “internal control over financial reporting” as defined in exchange act rule 13a15f and rule 15d15f to determine whether any changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the year ended december 31 2015  that materially affected or are reasonably likely to material affect our internal control over financial reporting 

based on that evaluation there have been no such changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2015  that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

d inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud control systems no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control systems’ objectives are being met further the design of any control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of all controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within our company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of error or mistake control systems can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

market overview 

solar energy is a growing form of renewable energy with numerous economic as well as environmental benefits that make it an attractive complement to andor substitute for traditional forms of electricity generation in recent years the price of pv systems and accordingly the cost of producing electricity from pv solar has dropped to levels that are in some markets and applications close to or even below the retail price of electricity the rapid price decline that pv experienced in the last few years opens new possibilities to develop pv systems in some locations with limited or no financial incentives the fact that a pv solar system requires no fuel provides a unique and valuable hedging benefit to owners of pv systems relative to traditional electricity generation assets once installed solar systems can function for 25 or more years with relatively less maintenance or oversight compared to traditional forms of electricity generation in addition to pv solar’s economic benefits pv solar has several environmental benefits for example pv systems do not generate any greenhouse gas or other emissions and use no or minimal amounts of water compared to traditional forms of electricity generation solar markets worldwide continue to develop aided by the above factors as well as demand elasticity resulting from declining industry average selling prices both at the module and system level which make solar power more affordable to new markets and we have continued to develop our localized presence and expertise in these markets 

the solar industry continues to be characterized by intense pricing competition both at the module and system levels we believe the solar industry will continue to experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity exceeds global demand and that such periods will put pressure on pricing in light of such market realities we continue to execute our long term strategic plan described below under which we are focusing on our competitive strengths a key core strength is our differentiated vertically integrated business model that enables us to provide utilityscale pv generation solutions to sustainable geographic markets that have an immediate need for massscale pv electricity 

strategy and competitive strengths 

to build upon our industry leading position and to remain one of the preferred providers of pv energy solutions we are pursuing the following strategies differentiation sustainable growth and financial viability

sustainable growth 

in executing our long term strategic plan we are focusing on providing solar pv generation solutions to sustainable geographic markets that we believe have a compelling need for massscale pv electricity including markets throughout the americas asia australia the middle east and africa as part of our long term strategic plan we are focusing on opportunities in which our solar pv generation solutions can compete directly with fossil fuel offerings on an lcoe or similar basis or complement such fossil fuel electricity generations execution of the long term strategic plan entails a development of resources around the globe in particular dedicating resources to regions such as latin america asia the middle east and africa we are evaluating and managing closely the appropriate level of resources required as we transition into and penetrate these specific markets we have and intend to continue to dedicate significant capital and human resources to reduce the total installed cost of solar pv generation to optimize the design and logistics around our solar pv generation solutions and to ensure that our solutions integrate well into the overall electricity ecosystem of each specific market we expect that over time an increasing portion of our consolidated net sales operating income and cash flows will come from solar offerings in the sustainable markets described above as we execute on our long term strategic plan the timing execution and financial impacts of our long term strategic plan are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in item 1a “risk factors” 

joint ventures or other business arrangements with strategic partners are a key part of our long term strategic plan and we use such arrangements to expedite our penetration of various markets and establish relationships with potential customers and policymakers some of these business arrangements have and are expected in the future to involve significant investments or other allocations of capital on our part we continue to develop relationships with policymakers regulators and end customers in each of these markets with a view to developing markets for utility scale pv solar power systems we sell solar power solutions directly to end customers including independent power producers utilities retail electricity providers and commercial and industrial customers depending on the market opportunity our sales offerings range from module only sales to module sales with a range of development engineering procurement and construction “epc” services and solutions to full turnkey pv solar power system sales we expect these sales offerings to continue to evolve over time as we work with our customers to optimize how our pv solar generation solutions can best meet our customers’ energy and economic needs in addition to our utilityscale power plant offerings we have fuel displacement commercial industrial and offgrid and energy access offerings as described below 

financial viability 

first solar’s commitment is to create longterm shareholder value and generate returns on invested capital in excess of its weighted average cost of capital over that time horizon despite substantial downward pressure on the price of solar modules due to significant excess capacity in the industry we have continued to deliver strong financial performance and liquidity as planned we expect to continue to drive operating expense efficiencies and improvements while still investing in growth the continued development of our global sales capabilities and our rd roadmap we seek to balance our incentive compensation and decisionmaking processes to ensure we direct our efforts and investments towards longterm profitable and sustainable growth with appropriate returns on invested capital and reinvest excess returns back into the business

in europe which accounted for approximately 4  of our 2014 net sales we have been engaged in project development activities with respect to certain projects in the united kingdom germany france and the netherlands and we are actively evaluating additional project and business opportunities in turkey israel and emerging southeastern european markets as well as mature western european solar markets we are party to a joint venture with belectric solarkraftwerke gmbh to realize solar energy projects on three continents the joint venture is based in germany and is tasked with developing selected pv power projects independently acquired or developed by either of the two companies in europe north africa as well as projects of fewer than 20 megawatts in the united states under the terms of the joint venture first solar will supply its thinfilm modules selected components such as the first solar tracker and valueadded services while belectric will provide its advanced balance of systems and a range of service capabilities both companies’ engineering procurement and construction contributions will vary by project and geography in november 2014 first solar and belectric announced groundbreaking on a new 46 mw dc utilityscale power plant in oxfordshire southern englandthe project is the fourth to be executed in the united kingdom under the joint venture with its recently built solar farms in wiltshire and east anglia the joint venture is expecting to reach a total capacity of 80 mw dc in the united kingdom 

   

jordan and egypt have actively facilitated the development of the independent power production sector in their countries as a means of responding to urgent energy needs for example jordan has committed to installing 600mw of solar pv capacity by 2020 while egypt recently launched the middle east’s first multigigawatt scale solar tender which was oversubscribed meanwhile the emirate of dubai in the united arab emirates doubled the capacity of the second phase of its flagship solar park to 200mw it has also tripled its renewable energy commitment from 5 to 15 percent of its generation capacity by 2030 however as with any emerging market challenges remain and these are primarily with regard to evolving policy and legislation prevailing energy subsidies available infrastructure and geopolitical risk 

  

first solar is pursuing a wide range of opportunities to support the middle east region’s efforts to cultivate its considerable solar resources we established a local business presence in dubai and in saudi arabia we constructed the 13 mw dc first phase of the mohammed bin rashid al maktoum solar park in dubai which set the benchmark for utility scale solar in the region in jordan we supported the development of and will construct the 53mw ac shams ma’an solar plant which is expected to account for one percent of jordan’s annual energy output when it is completed in 2016

first solar is currently constructing for agl energy limited a 102 mw solar power plant at nyngan and a 53 mw solar project at broken hill both located in new south wales the nyngan and broken hill solar projects will be australia’s largest utilityscale solar projects once completed in 2015 in 2012 first solar completed construction of the 10 mw greenough river solar farm in western australia in cooperation with verve energy and ge energy financial services greenough river solar farm is the largest pv solar farm in operation in australia in addition to supplying thin film pv modules and epc services for the plant first solar is providing om services under a 15 year contract 

 

we established a japan operating subsidiary and opened an office in tokyo to effectively pursue growth opportunities in 2014 we completed construction of a 14 mw dc solar project in kitakyushushi japan using our cdte pv modules we are expecting to partner with japanese companies to develop construct and operate solar power plants mitigating japan’s dependence on nuclear power and natural gas fuel imports our sales offerings in japan include both our cdte modules and high efficiency tetrasun crystalline silicon modules 

 

in addition to national level initiatives various indian states have also embarked on solar power programs at the state level renewable purchase obligations “rpos” have been introduced to help drive the pv market in india affected electricity consumers can achieve their purchase obligations by setting up their own installation or purchasing power directly through a ppa alternatively they can purchase solar renewable energy certificates from other producers to meet their target 

in 2014 we announced plans to build 45 mw ac of utilityscale solar plants at two sites in the state of telangana india the project will supply electricity through the grid to the southern distribution company of telangana state limited for a period of 20 years additionally we continue to maintain our equity investment in kiran energy solar power pvt ltd and mahindra solar one pvt ltd power plants in india’s rajasthan state first solar in india is seeking to develop utility scale solar pv projects address the energyrpo needs of the utilities and also target the open access industrial and commercial power demand options such as partnering with local entrepreneurs to develop solutions for segments in the energy access market and creating solutions by combining solar pv with other modes of generation and reduce dependence on liquid fuels especially in backup or even primary power markets are also being explored for a description of some of the risks associated with our efforts in india see “item 1a risk factors  risks related to our markets and customers  our ability to pursue an expansion strategy in india could be adversely affected by protectionist or other adverse public policies”

support programs 

although our long term strategic plan provides for first solar to transition over time toward operating in sustainable markets that do not require solar specific government subsidies or support programs in the nearterm our net sales and profits remain subject to variability based on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives support programs for pv solar electricity generation depending on the jurisdiction include fits quotas including renewable portfolio standards and tendering systems and net energy metering programs in addition to these support programs financial incentives for pv solar electricity generation include tax incentives grants loans rebates and production incentives although we expect to become less impacted by and less dependent on support programs as we execute our long term strategic plan and transition into primarily sustainable markets support programs will continue to play varying roles in accelerating the adoption of pv solar systems around the world 

in europe renewable energy targets in conjunction with fits renewable obligation certificates “roc’s” and other schemes such as tenders for largescale pv have contributed to the growth in pv solar markets renewable energy targets prescribe how much energy consumption must come from renewable sources while incentive policies and competitive tenders policies are intended to support new supply development by providing investor certainty a 2009 european union “eu” directive on renewable energy which replaced an earlier 2001 directive sets varying targets for all eu member states in support of the directive’s goal of a 20 share of energy from renewable sources in the eu by 2020 and requires national action plans that establish clear pathways for the development of renewable energy sources 

tax incentive programs exist in the us at both the federal and state level and can take the form of investment and production tax credits accelerated depreciation and sales and property tax exemptions and abatements at the federal level investment tax credits for business and residential solar systems have gone through several cycles of enactment and expiration since the 1980’s in october 2008 the us congress extended the 30 federal energy investment tax credit “itc” for both residential and commercial solar installations for eight years through december 31 2016 the itc is a primary economic driver of solar installations in the us its extension through 2016 has contributed to greater medium term demand visibility in the us however its stepdown to 10 at the end of 2016 unless extended underscores the need for the lcoe from solar systems to continue to decline toward grid parity the stepdown of the 30 itc poses significant uncertainties regarding the future of us pv solar market demand 

the majority of states in the us have enacted legislation adopting renewable portfolio standards “rps” mechanisms under an rps regulated utilities and other load serving entities are required to procure a specified percentage of their total electricity sales to enduser customers from eligible renewable resources such as solar generating facilities by a specified date some programs may further require that a specified portion of the total percentage of renewable energy must come from solar generating facilities rps legislation and implementing regulations vary significantly from state to state particularly with respect to the percentage of renewable energy required to achieve the state’s rps the definition of eligible renewable energy resources and the extent to which renewable energy credits certificates representing the generation of renewable energy qualify for rps compliance measured in terms of the volume of renewable electricity required to meet its rps mandate california’s rps program is the most significant in the us and the california market for renewable energy has dominated the western us region for the past several years first enacted in 2002 california’s rps statute has been amended several times to increase the overall percentage requirement as well as to accelerate the target date for program compliance pursuant to amendments enacted by the california legislature in 2011 the california rps program now requires utilities and other obligated load serving entities to procure 33 of their retail electricity demand from eligible renewable resources by 2020 in 2014 approximately 73  of our total net sales were derived from our systems projects or thirdparty module sales to solar power systems in california 

business segments 

we operate our business in two segments our components segment involves the design manufacture and sale of solar modules which convert sunlight into electricity we manufacture cdte modules and we also began manufacturing highefficiency crystalline silicon modules during the fourth quarter of 2014 thirdparty customers of our components segment include project developers system integrators and owners and operators of pv solar power systems

see note 24 “segment and geographical information”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2014  included in this annual report on form 10k for further information on our business segments 

components business 

our components business involves the design manufacture and sale of solar modules which convert sunlight into electricity 

solar modules 

cdte modules  our flagship module since the inception of first solar has been manufactured using our advanced cdte thinfilm technology each solar module is a glass laminate approximately 2ft x 4ft 60cm x 120cm in size that encapsulates a cdte thinfilm semiconductor our solar modules had an average rated power per module of approximately 95 watts  91 watts  and 86 watts  for 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively during 2014 we announced the release of our series 4 tm  module which offers up to eight percent more energy than conventional crystalline silicon modules with the same power rating and is compatible with advanced 1500volt plant architectures the series 4a tm  variant features a new antireflective coated glass which enhances energy production our semiconductor structure is a singlejunction polycrystalline thinfilm that uses cdte as the absorption layer cdte has absorption properties that are matched to the solar spectrum and can deliver competitive conversion efficiencies using only about 12 of the amount of semiconductor material ie silicon that is used to traditional manufacture crystalline silicon solar modules one of the drivers of first solar modules’ performance advantage over crystalline silicon modules is a lower temperature coefficient delivering higher energy yields at elevated operating temperature typical of utilityscale solar power plants in sunny regions 

crystalline silicon modules  in the fourth quarter of 2014 we began manufacturing modules incorporating highefficiency crystalline silicon technology for deployment in space constrained applications 

descriptions below of our components business relate to our cdte modules unless otherwise noted 

manufacturing process 

cdte modules 

we manufacture our cdte solar modules on highthroughput production lines and perform all manufacturing steps ourselves in an automated proprietary and continuous process our solar modules employ a thin layer of semiconductor material to convert sunlight into electricity our manufacturing process eliminates the multiple supply chain operators and expensive and timeconsuming batch processing steps that are used to produce crystalline silicon solar modules currently we manufacture our solar modules at our perrysburg ohio and kulim malaysia manufacturing facilities 

we have integrated our cdte manufacturing processes into a continuous production line with the following three stages the deposition stage the cell definition and treatment stage and the assembly and test stage in the deposition stage panels of transparent oxidecoated glass are robotically loaded onto the production line where they are cleaned heated and coated with thin layers of cadmium sulfide followed by a layer of cdte using our proprietary vapor transport deposition technology after which the semiconductorcoated plates are cooled rapidly to increase strength in the cell definition and treatment stage we use high speed lasers to transform the large single semiconductor coating on the glass plate into a series of interconnected cells that deliver the desired current and voltage output in this stage we also treat the semiconductor film using proprietary chemistries and processes to improve the device performance and we apply a metal terminated sputtered back contact finally in the assembly and test stage we apply busbars interlaminate material and a rear glass cover sheet that is laminated to encapsulate the semiconductor a junction box and termination wires are then applied to complete the assembly the final assembly stage is the only stage in our production line that requires manual processing 

we maintain a robust quality and reliability assurance program that monitors critical process parameters to ensure that industry and internal standards are met this rigorous set of evaluations is conducted prior to each solar module undergoing acceptance testing for both electrical leakage and power measurement on a solar simulator the quality and reliability tests complement production surveillance with an ongoing monitoring program subjecting production modules to accelerated life cycle and stress testing to ensure conformance to requirements of the international electrotechnical commission “iec” and underwriters laboratories inc “ul” this program assures a high level of product quality and reliability helping to predict power performance in the field 

 12 

crystalline silicon modules 

we manufacture our crystalline silicon cells in our new wafer fab in kulim malaysia the manufacturing process starts with 156mm n type mono crystalline silicon wafers supplied by a variety of wafer suppliers incoming wafers are subjected to a series of inspections to ensure that high quality standards are met the proprietary manufacturing process consists of passivation annealing metallization printing wet cleans and electroplating steps and are all fully automated independent steps completed cells are tested and binned according to strict performance criteria the final module assembly is completed by a contract manufacturing company that performs manufacturing to our module specifications using a bill of materials managed by us 

we maintain a robust quality and reliability assurance program that monitors critical process parameters to ensure that industry and internal standards are met this rigorous set of evaluations is conducted prior to each solar module undergoing acceptance testing for both electrical leakage and power measurement on a solar simulator the quality and reliability tests complement production surveillance with an ongoing monitoring program subjecting production modules to accelerated life cycle and stress testing to ensure conformance to iec and ul requirements this program assures a high level of product quality and reliability helping to predict power performance in the field 

research development and engineering 

we continue to devote substantial resources to research and development with the primary objective of lowering the lifecycle cost of electricity generated by our pv systems we conduct our research and development activities primarily in the united states within our components business we focus our research and development activities on among other areas continuing to increase the conversion efficiency and energy yield of our solar modules and continuously improving durability and manufacturing efficiencies including throughput improvement volume ramp and material cost reduction 

in the course of our research and development activities we continuously explore and research technologies in our efforts to sustain competitive differentiation in our modules we typically qualify process and product improvements for full production at our perrysburg ohio plant and then use a systematic process to propagate them to our other production lines we believe that our systematic approach to technology change management will provide continuous improvements and ensure uniform adoption across our production lines in addition our cdte production lines are replicas or near replicas of each other and as a result a process or production improvement on one line can be rapidly deployed to other production lines 

we regularly produce research cells in our laboratories some of which are tested for performance and certified by independent labs such as the national renewable energy laboratory cell efficiency measures the proportion of light converted in a single solar cell at standard test conditions our research cells are produced using laboratory equipment and methods and are not intended to be representative of our manufacturing capability we believe that our record cells demonstrate a potential longterm module efficiency entitlement of over 18 using our commercial scale manufacturing equipment 

during 2013 we acquired ge’s global cdte solar intellectual property portfolio setting a course for significant advancement of our pv thinfilm solar technology the combination of the two companies’ complementary technologies and first solar’s existing manufacturing capabilities are expected to accelerate the development of cdte solar module performance and improve efficiency at manufacturing scale in addition ge global research and first solar rd are collaborating on future technology development to further advance cdte solar technology pursuant to an agreement through 2016

with respect to our components business during 2014 we sold the majority of our solar modules not included in our systems projects to solar power system project developers system integrators and operators headquartered primarily in germany india and the united states which either resell our solar modules to endusers or integrate them into solar power plants that they own operate or sell thirdparty module sales represented approximately 7 of our total 2014 net sales additionally we develop design construct and sell pv solar power systems that use the solar modules we manufacture 

during 2014 nextera energy inc  southern company  and midamerican energy company  individually accounted for more than 10 of our components segment’s net sales which includes the solar modules used in our systems projects we are investing in sustainable market development particularly in areas with abundant solar resources and sizable electricity demand and as part 

 13 

of such efforts we are seeking to develop additional customer relationships in sustainable markets and regions which has reduced and is expected to continue to reduce our customer and geographic concentration and dependence 

competition 

the renewable energy solar energy and solar module sectors are highly competitive and continually evolving as participants in these sectors strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete within the larger electric power industry we face intense competition for sales of solar modules which has resulted in and may continue to result in reduced margins and loss of market share with respect to our components business our primary sources of competition are currently crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers as well as other thinfilm module manufacturers and companies developing solar thermal and concentrated pv technologies certain of our existing or future competitors may be part of larger corporations that have greater financial resources and greater brand name recognition than we do and as a result may be better positioned to adapt to changes in the industry or the economy as a whole certain competitors may have direct or indirect access to sovereign capital which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time among pv module and cell manufacturers the principal methods of competition include sales price per watt conversion efficiency reliability warranty terms and customer payment terms if competitors reduce module pricing to levels near or below their manufacturing costs or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time our results of operations could be adversely affected at december 31 2014 the global pv industry consisted of more than approximately 164 manufacturers of solar modules and cells in the aggregate these manufacturers have significant production capacity relative to global demand we believe the solar industry will continue to experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity exceeds global demand and that such periods will put pressure on pricing which could adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition we expect to compete with future entrants to the pv industry that offer new technological solutions we also face competition from semiconductor manufacturers and semiconductor equipment manufacturers or their customers that produce pv cells solar modules or turnkey production lines we also face competition from companies that currently offer or are developing other renewable energy technologies including wind hydropower geothermal biomass and tidal technologies and other power generation sources that employ conventional fossil fuels 

raw materials 

our cdte module manufacturing process uses approximately 30 types of raw materials and components to construct a complete solar module one critical raw material in our production process is cadmium telluride of the other raw materials and components the following eight are also critical to our manufacturing process front glass coated with transparent conductive oxide cadmium sulfide photo resist laminate material tempered back glass cord platecord plate cap lead wire and solar connectors before we use these materials and components in our manufacturing process a supplier must undergo a rigorous qualification process we continually evaluate new suppliers and currently are qualifying several new suppliers and materials when possible we attempt to use suppliers that can provide a raw material supply source that is near our manufacturing locations reducing the cost and lead times for such materials a few of our critical materials or components are single sourced and most others are supplied by a limited number of suppliers 

cdte solar module collection and recycling program 

first solar is committed to extended producer responsibility and takes into account the environmental impact of its products over their entire life cycle we established the solar industry’s first comprehensive module collection and recycling program first solar’s module recycling process is designed to maximize the recovery of valuable materials including the glass and encapsulated semiconductor material for use in new modules or other new products and minimizes the environmental impacts associated with our modules at the end of their useful life approximately 90 of each collected first solar module can be recycled into materials for use in new products including new solar modules 

first solar offers recycling services to customers to help them meet these module collection and recycling obligations first solar’s recycling service provides plant owners with the flexibility of determining endof life module disposition with options that enable them to more efficiently manage their capital and improve their returns for modules sold under sales arrangements covered under the solar module collection and recycling program “the program” we include a description of our module collection and recycling obligations for such modules covered under the program we agree to cover the costs for the collection and recycling of solar modules and the endusers agree to notify us disassemble their solar power systems package the solar modules for shipment and revert module ownership rights back to us at the end of the modules’ service lives 

 14 

the european union’s waste electronics and electrical equipment “weee” directive places the obligation of recycling including collection treatment and environmentally sound disposal of electrical and electronic equipment “eee” products upon producers the directive is now applicable to solar pv modules in many of the eu countries for modules covered under the program that have been sold to and installed in the eu we continue to maintain a commitment to cover and prefund the estimated collection and recycling costs consistent with our historical program however as the detailed legal requirements of the transposed weee directive become known through 2015 we will prospectively adjust our offering in the various eu member states as required to ensure compliance with the local eu member state regulations 

for our prefunded collection and recycling program we continue to fund the estimated collection and recycling cost incremental to amounts already prefunded in prior years for the cumulative modules covered by the program within 90 days of the end of each fiscal year assuming for this purpose a minimum service life of 25 years for our solar modules in addition to achieving substantial environmental benefits our solar module collection and recycling program may provide us the opportunity to recover certain raw materials and components for reuse in our manufacturing process we currently have recycling facilities operating at each manufacturing facility with sufficient capacity for manufacturing scrap anticipated warranty returns and modules collected at the end of their useful life over the next several years that produce glass cullet suitable for use in the production of new glass products by a thirdparty supplier and unrefined semiconductor materials that will be further processed by a thirdparty supplier and then used to produce semiconductor materials for use in new solar modules 

to ensure that the prefunded amounts for covered modules under the program are available regardless of our financial status in the future a trust structure has been established funds are put into custodial accounts in the name of a trustee only the trustee can distribute funds from the custodial accounts for qualified collection and recycling costs these funds cannot be accessed for any purpose other than for qualified module collection and recycling costs of first solar modules such collection and recycling services will either be performed by us or a thirdparty end users with solar modules covered by our prefunded program can request collection and recycling of their eligible solar modules by us at any time at no additional cost 

solar module warranties 

we provide a limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for 10 years following delivery to the owners of our solar modules we also typically warrant to our owners that solar modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 97 of their labeled power output rating during the first year with the warranty coverage reducing by 07 every year thereafter throughout the 25 year performance warranty prior to 2014 we typically warranted to our owners that solar modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications would produce at least 90 of their labeled power output rating during the first 10 years following their installation and at least 80 of their labeled power output rating during the following 15 years in resolving claims under both the defects and power output warranties we have the option of either repairing or replacing the covered solar modules or under the power output warranty providing additional solar modules to remedy the power shortfall we also have the option to make a payment for the then current market price for solar modules to resolve claims our warranties are automatically transferred from the original purchasers of our solar modules to subsequent purchasers upon resale 

as an alternative to our module power output warranty we have offered a system level module performance warranty for a limited number of our recent system sales this system level module performance warranty is designed for utility scale systems and provides 25year plantlevel energy degradation protection the system level module performance warranty typically is calculated as a percentage of a system’s expected energy production adjusted for certain actual site conditions with the warranted level of performance declining each year in a linear fashion but never falling below 80 during the term of the warranty in resolving claims under the system level module performance warranty to restore the system to warranted performance levels we first must validate that the root cause is due to module performance then we typically have the option of either repairing or replacing modules providing supplemental modules or making a cash payment consistent with our module power output warranty when we elect to satisfy a valid warranty claim by providing replacement or supplement modules under the system level module performance warranty we do not have any obligation to pay for the labor to remove or install modules 

currently a majority of our systems projects are subject to such system level module performance warranty and we expect that this percentage will increase in the future as we extend it to future systems sales arrangements we do not anticipate that the system level module performance warranty will have a material impact on our future warranty claim rates as such warranty is designed to be in line with the expected riskadjusted aggregate performance of our modules the offering of such system level warranty addresses the challenge of identifying from the potential millions of modules installed in a utility scale system individual modules that are performing below warranty by focusing on the energy generated by the system rather than the capacity of individual modules 

 15 

 from time to time we have taken remediation actions with respect to affected modules beyond our limited warranty and we may elect to do so in the future in which case we would incur additional expenses such potential voluntary future remediation actions beyond our limited warranty obligation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations if we commit to any such remediation actions 

systems business 

through our fully integrated systems business we provide a complete turnkey solar power system solution or any combination of our systems solutions which may include project development epc services om services and project finance 

our systems business has grown over the past several years through a combination of business acquisitions and organic growth in january 2013 we acquired solar chile a santiagobased solar development company solar chile has a portfolio of utilityscale pv power projects in varying stages of development currently totaling approximately 1 gw in northern chile including the atacama desert region which offers the highest solar irradiance in the world in addition in august 2013 we acquired a pipeline of us and mexico development assets from element power included in the 15 gw pipeline are diverse projects in various stages of development in california arizona texas georgia north carolina colorado louisiana illinois and mexico 

project development 

project development activities include site selection and securing rights to acquire or use the site obtaining in a timely manner the requisite interconnection and transmission studies executing an interconnection agreement obtaining environmental and land use permits maintaining effective site control and entering into a ppa with an offtaker of the power to be generated by the project these activities culminate in receiving the right to construct and operate a solar power system depending on the market opportunity or geographic location we may acquire projects in various stages of development or acquire project companies from developers in order to complete the development process construct a pv power plant incorporating our modules and sell the system to a longterm project owner or in certain cases operate the system on our own depending on the market opportunity or geographic location we may collaborate with local partners in connection with these project development activities depending on the type of project or geographic location ppas or fit structures define the price and terms the utility customer or investor will pay for power produced from a project entering into a ppa generally provides the underlying economics needed to finalize development including permitting beginning construction arranging financing and marketing the project for sale to a longterm project owner depending primarily on the location stage of development upon our acquisition of the project and other site attributes the development cycle typically ranges from one to five years we may be required to incur significant costs for preliminary engineering permitting legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built if there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals we may be forced to incur additional costs writedown capitalized project assets and the right of the offtaker under the ppa to terminate may be triggered 

customers 

with respect to our systems business our customers consist of investor owned utilities independent power developers and producers commercial and industrial companies and other system owners who may purchase from us completed solar power plants which include our solar modules any combination of epc services and om services for the plants we build during 2014  the substantial majority of our systems business sales were generated in north america 

during 2014  the principal customers of our systems segment were southern company  nextera energy inc  and midamerican energy company  each of which also accounted for more than 10 of our systems segment net sales during 2014  

competition 

with respect to our systems business we face competition from other providers of renewable energy solutions including developers of pv solar thermal and concentrated solar power systems and developers of other forms of renewable energy projects including wind hydropower geothermal biomass and tidal projects to the extent other solar module manufacturers become more vertically integrated we expect to face increased competition from such companies as well we also face competition from other epc companies and joint venture type arrangements between epc companies and solar companies certain current or potential future competitors may also have a low cost of capital andor access to foreign capital while the decline in pv modules prices over the last several years has increased interest in solar electricity worldwide there are limited barriers of entry in many parts of the pv solar value chain depending on the geographic market accordingly competition at the systems level can be intense thereby exerting downward pressure on systems level profit margins industrywide to the extent competitors are willing and able to bid aggressively low prices for new projects and ppas using low cost assumptions for modules bos components installation maintenance and other costs please see item 1a “risk factors  competition at the systems level can be intense 

 16 

depending on the market opportunity thereby potentially exerting downward pressure on systems level profit margins industrywide which could reduce our net sales profitability and adversely affect our results of operations” 

epc warranty 

in addition to our solar module warranties described above for solar power plants built by our systems business we typically provide a limited warranty on the balance of the system against defects in engineering design installation and workmanship for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a phase or the entire solar power plant in resolving claims under the engineering design installation and workmanship warranties we have the option of remedying the defect through repair or replacement 

as part of our systems business we conduct performance testing of the solar power plant prior to substantial completion to confirm the power plant meets operational and capacity expectations noted in the epc agreement in addition we may provide an energy generation performance test during the first year of the solar power plant’s operation such a test is designed to demonstrate that the actual energy generation for the first year meets or exceeds the modeled energy expectation after certain adjustments and exclusions if there is an underperformance event determined at the end of the first year after substantial completion we may incur liquidated damages as a percentage of the epc contract price in some instances a bonus payment may be received at the end of the first year if the power plant performs above a certain level in limited cases a similar energy generation test is offered as part of our operations and maintenance service up to a maximum of five years in such a case liquidated damages are incurred at the lost energy price noted in the ppa 

research development and engineering 

our systems business research and development activities are primarily focused on the objective of lowering the lcoe through reductions in bos costs improved systems design and energy yield enhancements associated with pv systems that use our solar modules these rd efforts are also focused on continuing to improve our systems in terms of grid stabilization we conduct our research and development activities for the systems business primarily in the united states innovations related to system design hardware platforms inverters trackers and installation techniques and know how among other things can and are expected in the future to continue to reduce bos costs which can represent a significant portion of the costs associated with the construction of a typical utilityscale pv solar power system

own and operate 

from time to time we may temporarily own and operate certain pv solar power systems while we attempt to market them the ability to do so allows us to gain control of the sales process provide a lower risk profile to a future buyer of a system and improve our ability to drive higher eventual sale values as of february 2015 we owned or have ownership interests in and operated three solar power plants as an owner and operator of these pv solar power systems we and certain of our operating subsidiaries are subject to the authority of the federal energy regulatory commission “ferc” as well as various other local state and federal regulatory bodies for more information about risks related to owning and operating pv solar power systems please see item 1a “risk factors  as a temporary owner and operator of certain pv solar systems that are delivering electricity to the grid certain of our indirect subsidiaries are regulated as a public utility under us federal and state law which could adversely affect the cost of doing business and limit our growth” for more information about the economics of such ownership and the impacts on our liquidity see item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources” 

intellectual property 

our success depends in part on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technology and to conduct our business without infringing on the proprietary rights of others we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks and trade secrets as well as associate and thirdparty confidentiality agreements to safeguard our intellectual property we regularly file patent applications to protect inventions arising from our research and development and are currently pursuing patent applications in the us and worldwide our patent applications and any future patent applications might not result in a patent being issued with the scope of the claims we seek or at all and any patents we may receive may be challenged invalidated or declared unenforceable in addition we have registered andor have applied to register trademarks and service marks in the us and a number of foreign countries for “first solar” and “first solar and design” 

 17 

with respect to proprietary knowhow that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce we rely on among other things trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests we believe that many elements of our pv module manufacturing process including our unique materials sourcing involve proprietary knowhow technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications including technical processes equipment designs algorithms and procedures we have taken security measures to protect these elements our research and development personnel have entered into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us these agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our associates to assign to us all of the inventions designs and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us we also require our customers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our modules technology or business plans 

we have not been subject to any material intellectual property infringement or misappropriation claims 

environmental health and safety matters 

our operations include the use handling storage transportation generation and disposal of hazardous materials and hazardous wastes we are subject to various national state local and international laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the use management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes occupational health and safety and the cleanup of contaminated sites therefore we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions and costs arising from thirdparty property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations or noncompliance with environmental permits required for our operations we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety requirements and do not expect to incur material expenditures for environmental and occupational health and safety controls in the foreseeable future however future developments such as the implementation of new more stringent laws and regulations more aggressive enforcement policies or the discovery of unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition see item 1a “risk factors  environmental obligations and liabilities could have a substantial negative impact on our financial condition cash flows and profitability”

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the following information together with the other information in this annual report on form 10k before buying shares of our stock if any of the following risks or uncertainties occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our stock could decline 

  

risks related to our markets and customers 

competition at the systems level can be intense thereby potentially exerting downward pressure on systems level profit margins industrywide which could reduce our net sales profitability and adversely affect our results of operations 

the significant decline in pv module prices over the last several years has and continues to create a challenging environment for module manufacturers but it has also increased interest in solar electricity worldwide by eroding one of the primary historical constraints to widespread solar market penetration namely its affordability aided by such lower module prices competitors have in many cases been willing and able to bid aggressively for new projects and ppas using low cost assumptions for modules bos components installation maintenance and other costs as the basis for such bids relatively low barriers to entry for competitors have led to depending on the market and other factors intense competition at the systems level intense competition at the systems level can result in an environment in which systems level pricing falls rapidly thereby further increasing demand for solar solutions but constraining the ability for project developers epc companies andor verticallyintegrated solar companies such as first solar to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability accordingly while we believe our systems offerings and experience are positively differentiated in many cases from that of our competitors we may fail to correctly identify our competitive position we may be unable to develop or maintain a sufficient magnitude of new systems projects worldwide at economically attractive rates of return and we may not otherwise be able to achieve meaningful profitability under our long term strategic plan 

depending on the market opportunity we may be at a disadvantage compared to potential systemslevel competitors for example certain of our competitors may have a stronger andor more established localized business presence in a particular geographic region certain of our competitors may be larger entities that have greater financial resources and greater overall brand name recognition than we do and as a result may be better positioned to impact customer behavior or adapt to changes in the industry or the economy as a whole certain competitors may also have direct or indirect access to sovereign capital andor other incentives which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time 

additionally largescale solar systems are still in their relatively early stages of existence and depending on the geographic area many potential customers are still in the process of educating themselves about the points of differentiation among various available providers of pv solar solutions including a company’s proven overall experience and bankability system design and optimization expertise grid interconnection and stabilization expertise and proven om capabilities if we are unable over time to meaningfully differentiate our offerings at scale from the viewpoint of our potential customer base our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may continue to cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

solar manufacturers have significant aggregate installed production capacity in relation to global demand we believe the solar industry will continue to experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity exceeds global demand and that such periods will put pressure on pricing during the past several years industry average sales prices per watt “asps” have declined significantly both at the module and system levels as competitors reduced asps to sellthrough inventories worldwide if our competitors reduce module pricing to levels near or below their manufacturing costs or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time or if demand for pv modules does not grow sufficiently to justify the current production supply our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

if pv technology is not suitable for widespread adoption at economically attractive rates of return or if sufficient additional demand for solar modules does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate our net sales and profit may flatten or decline and we may be unable to sustain profitability 

the solar energy market is at a relatively early stage of development in comparison to fossil fuelbased electricity generation if pv technology proves unsuitable for widespread adoption at economically attractive rates of return or if additional demand for solar modules and systems fails to develop sufficiently or takes longer to develop than we anticipate we may be unable to grow 

 21 

our business or generate sufficient net sales to sustain profitability in addition demand for solar modules and systems in our targeted markets may develop to a lesser extent than we anticipate many factors may affect the viability of widespread adoption of pv technology and demand for solar modules and systems including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reduced growth in or the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives renewable energy targets and other support for ongrid solar electricity applications or increase in protectionist or other adverse public policies could reduce demand andor price levels for our solar modules and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales and adversely impact our operating results 

although our long term strategic plan provides for first solar to transition over time toward operating in sustainable markets that do not require solar specific government subsidies or support programs and it is our belief that solar pv will experience widespread adoption in those applications where it competes economically with traditional forms of energy without any support programs in the nearterm our net sales and profits remain subject to variability based on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives federal state and local governmental bodies in many countries have provided subsidies in the form of fits rebates tax incentives and other incentives to endusers distributors systems integrators and manufacturers of pv products many of these support programs expire phase out over time require renewal by the applicable authority or may be amended in particular the stepdown of the us federal investment tax credit from 30 to 10 scheduled for the end of 2016 poses significant uncertainties regarding us pv solar market demand a summary of recent developments in the major government support programs that can impact our business appears under item 1 “business – support programs” to the extent these support programs are reduced earlier than previously expected or are changed retroactively or freefield or conversion land applications are disadvantaged such changes could reduce demand andor price levels for our solar modules and systems lead to a reduction in our net sales and adversely impact our operating results while the expected potential of the markets we are targeting is significant policy promulgation and market development are especially vulnerable to governmental inertia political instability geopolitical risk fossil fuel subsidization potentially stringent localization requirements and limited available infrastructure 

our ability to pursue an expansion strategy in india could be adversely affected by protectionist or other adverse public policies 

under phase i of the national solar mission india required developers of solar pv projects employing crystalline silicon technology to use solar cells and modules manufactured in india first solar modules were not impacted by this restriction however in its policy guideline for batch i phase ii of the national solar mission india has set aside 375 mw of the 750 mw program for domestically manufactured cells and modules irrespective of the technology used crystalline silicon or thin film this setaside effectively cuts the ability of first solar to compete in the batch i phase ii program in half in february 2013 the united states government announced that it would expand its previously requested world trade organization dispute settlement consultations with the government of india on phase i local content requirements “lcrs” to include consultations on the lcrs in phase ii the outcome of the consultation is still pending

we could be adversely affected by any violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” the uk bribery act and other foreign antibribery laws  

the fcpa generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business other countries in which we operate also have antibribery laws some of which prohibit improper payments to government and nongovernment persons and entities and some of which eg the fcpa and the uk bribery act extend their application to activities outside of their country of origin our policies mandate compliance with all applicable antibribery laws we currently operate in and pursuant to our long term strategic plan intend to further expand into many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices in addition due to the level of regulation in our industry our operation in certain jurisdictions including india china south america and the middle east requires substantial government contact where norms can differ from us standards although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these antibribery laws our employees subcontractors agents and partners such as joint venture partners may take actions in violation of our policies and antibribery laws any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could subject us to criminal andor civil penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and reputation 

  

we may be unable to fully execute on our long term strategic plan which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we face numerous difficulties in executing our long term strategic plan particularly in new foreign jurisdictions including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  23 

 

 

 

in addition please see the risk factors entitled “our substantial international operations subject us to a number of risks including unfavorable political regulatory labor and tax conditions in foreign countries” and “reduced growth in or the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidiaries economic incentives and other support for ongrid solar electricity could reduce demand andor price levels for our solar modules and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales and adversely impact our operating results” 

we may be unable to profitably provide new solar offerings or achieve sufficient market penetration with such offerings 

we are in the process of expanding our lineup of offerings to include solutions that build upon our core competencies but for which we have not had significant historical experience with including the ac power block and offerings related to fuel displacement commercial and industrial and distributed generation for restricted spaces offgrid and energy access we cannot be certain that we will be able to ascertain and allocate the appropriate financial and human resources necessary to grow these business areas we could invest considerable capital into growing these businesses but fail to address market or customer needs or otherwise not experience a satisfactory level of financial return also in expanding into these areas we may be competing against companies that previously have not been significant competitors such as companies that currently have substantially more experience than we do in the rooftop or other targeted segments if we are unable to achieve growth in these areas our overall growth and financial performance may be limited relative to our competitors and our operating results could be adversely impacted 

an increase in interest rates or lending rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets including a reduction in total tax equity availability could make it difficult for customers to finance the cost of a pv system and could reduce the demand for our solar systems or modules andor lead to a reduction in the average selling price for pv modules 

many of our customers and our systems business depend on debt andor equity financing to fund the initial capital expenditure required to develop build andor purchase a pv system as a result an increase in interest rates or lending rates or a reduction in the supply of project debt financing or tax equity investments could reduce the number of solar projects that receive financing or otherwise make it difficult for our customers or our systems business to secure the financing necessary to develop build purchase or install a pv system on favorable terms or at all and thus lower demand for our solar modules which could limit our growth or reduce our net sales in addition we believe that a significant percentage of our endusers install pv systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt an increase in interest rates andor lending rates could lower an investor’s return on investment in a pv system increase equity return requirements or make alternative investments more attractive relative to pv systems and in each case could cause these endusers to seek alternative investments 

  

risks related to regulations 

existing regulations and policies changes thereto and new regulations and policies may present technical regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of pv products or systems which may significantly reduce demand for our solar modules systems or services 

the market for electricity generation products is heavily influenced by foreign federal state and local government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry as well as policies promulgated by electric utilities these regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customerowned electricity generation in the united states and in a number of other countries these regulations and policies have been modified in the past and may be modified again in the future these regulations and policies could deter enduser purchases of pv products and investment in the research and development of pv technology for example without a mandated regulatory exception for pv systems utility customers are often charged interconnection or standby fees for putting distributed power generation on the electric utility grid if these interconnection standby fees were applicable to pv systems it is likely that they would increase the cost of using pv systems to our endusers which could make them less desirable thereby adversely affecting our business prospects results of operations and financial condition in addition with respect to utilities that utilize a peak hour pricing policy or timeofuse pricing methods whereby the price of electricity is adjusted based on electricity supply and demand electricity generated by pv systems currently benefits from 

 24 

competing primarily with expensive peak hour electricity rather than the less expensive average price of electricity modifications to the peak hour pricing policies of utilities such as to a flat rate for all times of the day would require pv systems to achieve lower prices in order to compete with the price of electricity from other sources and would adversely impact our operating results 

our solar systems modules and services such as om are subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with national and local ordinances relating to building codes safety environmental protection utility interconnection and metering and other matters it is a complex task to track the requirements of individual jurisdictions any new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to our solar modules systems or services may result in significant additional expenses to us or our customers and as a result could cause a significant reduction in demand for our solar modules systems or services in addition any regulatory compliance failure could result in significant management distraction unplanned costs andor reputational damage 

environmental obligations and liabilities could have a substantial negative impact on our financial condition cash flows and profitability 

our operations involve the use handling generation processing storage transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations at the national state local and international levels these environmental laws and regulations include those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the use management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites and occupational health and safety as we execute our long term strategic plan and expand our business into foreign jurisdictions worldwide our environmental compliance burden will continue to increase both in terms of magnitude and complexity we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs and capital expenditures in complying with these laws and regulations in addition violations of or liabilities under environmental laws or permits may result in restrictions being imposed on our operating activities or in our being subjected to substantial fines penalties criminal proceedings thirdparty property damage or personal injury claims cleanup costs or other costs such solutions could also result in substantial delay or termination of projects under construction within our systems business which could adversely impact our results of operations while we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements future developments such as more aggressive enforcement policies the implementation of new more stringent laws and regulations or the discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our cdte solar modules contain cadmium telluride and cadmium sulfide elemental cadmium and certain of its compounds are regulated as hazardous materials due to the adverse health effects that may arise from human exposure based on existing research the risks of exposure to cadmium telluride are not believed to be as serious as those relating to exposure to elemental cadmium in our manufacturing operations we maintain engineering controls to minimize our associates’ exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds and require our associates who handle cadmium compounds to follow certain safety procedures including the use of personal protective equipment such as respirators chemical goggles and protective clothing relevant studies and thirdparty peer review of our technology have concluded that the risk of exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds from our endproducts is negligible in addition the risk of exposure is further minimized by the encapsulated nature of these materials in our products and the physical properties of cadmium compounds used in our products and the recycling or responsible disposal of first solar’s modules while we believe that these factors and procedures are sufficient to protect our associates endusers and the general public from adverse health effects that may arise from cadmium exposure we cannot ensure that human or environmental exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds used in our products will not occur any such exposure could result in future thirdparty claims against us as well as damage to our reputation and heightened regulatory scrutiny of our products which could limit or impair our ability to sell and distribute our products the occurrence of future events such as these could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

the use of cadmium in various products is also subject to governmental regulation in several countries more restrictive regulation in this area andor expansion of such regulation to additional countries could impact the manufacture sale collection and recycling of solar modules and could require us to make unforeseen environmental expenditures or limit our ability to sell and distribute our products 

as an owner and operator of certain pv solar power systems that are delivering electricity to the grid certain of our indirect affiliates are regulated as public utilities under us federal and state law which could adversely affect the cost of doing business and limit our growth 

as an owner and operator of certain pv solar power systems that are delivering electricity to the grid certain of our indirectlyowned operating affiliates are considered to be public utilities for purposes of the federal power act as amended the “fpa” and public utility companies for purposes of the public utility holding company act of 2005 “puhca 2005” and are subject to regulation by the ferc as well as various local and state regulatory bodies we currently have three such operating affiliates that are delivering electricity to the grid sg2 imperial valley llc “sg2” maryland solar llc “md solar” and barilla solar 

 25 

llc first project phase and two that are under construction lost hills solar llc and blackwell solar llc collectively “lost hills” which are deemed public utilities by the ferc 

sg2 and lost hills are “exempt wholesale generators” or “ewgs” and as such are exempt from regulation under puhca 2005 md solar is a “qualifying facility” or “qf” under the public utility regulatory policies act of 1978 as amended “purpa” and is also exempt from puhca 2005 in addition md solar is exempt from most provisions of the fpa as well as state laws regarding the financial or organizational regulation of public utilities we will also be exempt from regulation under puhca 2005 so long as sg2 and lost hills remain ewgs and so long as md solar remains a qf and the regulation does not change we are not directly subject to ferc regulation under the fpa however we are considered to be a “holding company” for purposes of section 203 of the fpa which regulates certain transactions involving public utilities and such regulation could adversely affect our ability to grow the business through acquisitions likewise investors seeking to acquire our public utility subsidiaries or acquire ownership interests in our securities sufficient to give them control over us and our public utility subsidiaries may require prior ferc approval to do so such approval could result in transaction delays or uncertainties 

public utilities under the fpa are required to obtain ferc acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of electricity and to comply with various regulations the ferc has granted sg2 and lost hills the authority to sell electricity at marketbased rates and has granted them certain regulatory waivers such as waivers from compliance with ferc’s accounting regulations these ferc orders reserve the right to revoke or revise marketbased sales authority if the ferc subsequently determines that sg2 and lost hills or their affiliates can exercise market power in the sale of generation products the provision of transmission services or if it finds that any of them can create barriers to entry by competitors in addition if they fail to comply with certain reporting obligations the ferc may revoke their power sales tariffs finally if they were deemed to have engaged in manipulative or deceptive practices concerning their power sales transactions they would be subject to potential fines disgorgement of profits andor suspension or revocation of their marketbased rate authority if our indirect subsidiaries were to lose their marketbased rate authority such companies would be required to obtain the ferc’s acceptance of a costofservice rate schedule and could become subject to the accounting recordkeeping and reporting requirements that are imposed on utilities with costbased rate schedules which would impose cost and compliance burdens on us and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition to the risks described above we would be subject to additional regulatory regimes at the state and foreign levels to the extent we own and operate pv power plants in the future in other states or foreign jurisdictions such as our 14 mw dc plant in kitakyushushi japan 

  

risks related to our operations manufacturing and technology 

our operating history to date may not serve as an adequate basis to judge our future prospects and results of operations 

our historical operating results may not provide a meaningful basis for evaluating our business financial performance and prospects we may be unable to achieve similar growth or grow at all in future periods our ability to achieve similar growth in future periods is also affected by current economic conditions our past results occurred in an environment where among other things capital was at times more accessible to our customers to finance the cost of developing solar projects and economic incentives for solar power in certain markets such as the german fit were more favorable accordingly you should not rely on our results of operations for any prior period as an indication of our future performance 

we face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules as well as thinfilm solar modules and solar thermal and concentrated pv systems if global supply exceeds global demand it could lead to a reduction in the average selling price for pv modules  which could reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations 

the solar energy and renewable energy industries are highly competitive and continually evolving as participants strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete with the larger electric power industry within the global pv industry we face competition from crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers other thinfilm solar module manufacturers and companies developing solar thermal and concentrated pv technologies existing or future solar manufacturers might be acquired by larger companies with significant capital resources thereby intensifying competition with us in addition the introduction of a low cost disruptive technology such as commercially viable energy storage could adversely affect our ability to compete which could reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations 

even if demand for solar modules continues to grow the rapid manufacturing capacity expansion undertaken by many solar module manufacturers particularly manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules has created and may continue to cause periods of structural imbalance during which supply exceeds demand see “an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may continue to cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations” in addition we believe any significant decrease in 

 26 

the cost of silicon feedstock could provide further reductions in the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules and lead to further pricing pressure for solar modules and potentially the oversupply of solar modules 

  

during any such period our competitors could decide to reduce their sales prices in response to competition even below their manufacturing costs in order to generate sales other competitors may have direct or indirect access to sovereign capital which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time as a result we may be unable to sell our solar modules or systems at attractive prices or for a profit during any period of excess supply of solar modules which would reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations also we may decide to lower our average selling price to certain customers in certain markets in response to competition 

thinfilm solar technology has a limited field history as a result and despite our efforts our solar modules and systems may perform below expectations problems with product quality or performance may cause us to incur significant andor unexpected warranty and related expenses damage our market reputation and prevent us from maintaining or increasing our market share 

we perform a variety of module quality and life tests under different conditions upon which we base our assessments and warranty of module performance over its expected useful life however if our thinfilm technology high efficiency crystalline technology and solar modules perform below expectations we could lose customers face substantial warranty expense and face potential liability under certain epc and om contracts for damages related to loss of revenue from energy production below expectation with respect to our modules we provide a limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for 10 years following delivery to the owners of our solar modules we also typically warrant to our owners that solar modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 97 of their labeled power output rating during the first year with the warranty coverage reducing to 07 every year thereafter throughout the 25 year performance warranty prior to 2014 we typically warranted to our owners that solar modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications would produce at least 90 of their labeled power output rating during the first 10 years following their installation and at least 80 of their labeled power output rating during the following 15 years as a result we bear the risk of extensive warranty claims long after we have sold our solar modules and recognized net sales as an alternative to our module power output warranty we have offered a system level module performance warranty for a limited number of our recent sales as of december 31 2014  our accrued warranty liability was 2231 million  of which 697 million  was classified as current and 1534 million  was classified as noncurrent 

we have historically estimated our product warranty liability for power output and defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions to have an estimated warranty return rate of approximately 3 of modules covered under warranty a 1 change in the estimated warranty return rate would change our estimated product warranty liability by approximately 604 million  

if any of our assumptions used in estimating the above referenced warranty or manufacturing excursion costs prove incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses which could adversely impact our financial position operating results and cash flows although we have taken significant corrective actions to avoid a manufacturing excursion from occurring any future manufacturing excursions including any commitments made by us to take remediation actions in respect of affected modules beyond our limited warranty could adversely impact our business reputation financial position operating results and cash flows 

although our power output warranty extends for 25 years our oldest solar modules manufactured during the qualification of our pilot production line have only been in use since 2001 as a result our warranty is based on a variety of quality and life tests that enable predictions of durability and future performance these predictions however could prove to be materially different from the actual performance over the full life of our solar modules causing us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective solar modules in the future for example our glassonglass solar modules could suffer various failure modes including breakage delamination corrosion or experience power degradation in excess of expectations and our manufacturing operations or supply chain could be subject to materials or process variations that could cause affected modules to fail or underperform compared to our expectations these risks could be amplified as we implement design and process changes in connection with our efforts to improve our product accelerate module conversion efficiency energy density and manufacturing production throughput improvements as part of our long term strategic plan in addition as we increase the number of installations in extreme climates in accordance with our long term strategic plan we may experience increased failure rates due to deployment into such field conditions any widespread product failures may damage our market reputation cause our sales to decline require us to repair or replace the defective modules and cause us to take voluntary remedial measures beyond those required by our standard warranty terms to enhance customer satisfaction which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

additionally we now offer a standard tracker mounting system warranty for a duration of 1  5 years as with our modules our tracker system warranty is based on a variety of quality and life tests that enable predictions of durability and future performance 

 27 

these predictions however could prove to be materially different from the actual performance over the full life or our tracker mounting systems causing us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective structures in the future 

in addition to our solar module and tracker system warranty described above for solar power plants built by our systems business we typically provide a limited warranty on the balance of the system against defects in engineering design installation and workmanship for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a phase or the entire solar power plant failures of solar power plants built by us could result in significant increases to warranty expense damage our market reputation or cause our sales to decline cause us to incur unexpected costs to remedy defects or otherwise negatively affect our results of operations 

in addition as part of our systems business we conduct performance testing of the solar power plant prior to substantial completion to confirm the power plant meets operational and capacity expectations noted in the epc agreement in addition we may provide an energy generation performance test during the first year of the solar power plant’s operation such a test is designed to demonstrate that the actual energy generation for the first year meets or exceeds the modeled energy expectation after certain adjustments and exclusions if there is an underperformance event determined at the end of the first year after substantial completion we may incur liquidated damages as a percentage of the epc contract price in some instances a bonus payment may be received at the end of the first year if the power plant performs above a certain level in limited cases a similar energy generation test is offered as part of our operations and maintenance service up to a maximum of five years in such a case liquidated damages are incurred at the lost energy price noted in the ppa 

if our estimates regarding the future cost of collecting and recycling solar cdte modules covered by our collection and recycling program are incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses at and from the time we realize our estimates are incorrect and face a significant unplanned cash burden 

prior to 2013 we have historically prefunded and may need to continue to prefund in certain circumstances our estimated future obligation for collecting and recycling cdte solar modules covered by our collection and recycling program based on the present value of the expected future cost of collecting and recycling the cdte solar modules which includes estimates for the cost of packaging the cdte solar modules for transport the cost of freight from the cdte solar module installation sites to a recycling center the material labor capital costs and scale of recycling centers and an estimated thirdparty profit margin and return on risk for collection and recycling services we base our estimate on our experience collecting and recycling cdte solar modules that do not pass our quality control tests and cdte solar modules returned under our warranty and on our expectations about future developments in recycling technologies and processes and economic conditions at the time the cdte solar modules are expected to be collected and recycled if our estimates prove incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses at and from the time we realize our estimates are incorrect and could also face a significant unplanned cash burden at the time we realize our estimates are incorrect or endusers return their cdte solar modules which could harm our operating results in addition participating endusers can return their cdte solar modules covered under the collection and recycling program at any time as a result we could be required to collect and recycle covered cdte solar modules earlier than we expect 

our failure to further refine our technology reduce module manufacturing and bos costs and develop and introduce improved pv products could render our solar modules or systems uncompetitive and reduce our net sales profitability andor market share 

we need to continue to invest significant financial resources in research and development to continue to improve our module conversion efficiency lower the lcoe of our pv systems and otherwise keep pace with technological advances in the solar energy industry however research and development activities are inherently uncertain and we could encounter practical difficulties in commercializing our research results we seek to continuously improve our products and processes and the resulting changes carry potential risks in the form of delays additional costs or other unintended contingencies in addition our significant expenditures on research and development may not produce corresponding benefits other companies are developing a variety of competing pv technologies including advanced multicrystalline silicon cells perc or advanced ptype crystalline silicon cells high efficiency ntype crystalline silicon cells copper indium gallium diselenide and amorphous silicon thin films which could produce solar modules or systems that prove more costeffective or have better performance than our solar modules or systems in addition other companies could potentially develop a highly reliable renewable energy system that mitigates the intermittent power production drawback of many renewable energy systems or offers other valueadded improvements from the perspective of utilities and other system owners in which case such companies could compete with us even if the lcoe associated with such new system is higher than that of our systems as a result our solar modules or systems may be negatively differentiated or rendered obsolete by the technological advances of our competitors which would reduce our net sales profitability andor market share 

 28 

in addition we often forward price our products and services in anticipation of future cost reductions and technology improvements and thus an inability to further refine our technology and execute our conversion efficiency roadmap and our longterm manufacturing cost bos cost and lcoe reduction objectives could adversely affect our margins and operating results 

our failure to protect our intellectual property rights may undermine our competitive position and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against thirdparty allegations of infringement may be costly 

protection of our proprietary processes methods and other technology is critical to our business failure to protect and monitor the use of our existing intellectual property rights could result in the loss of valuable technologies we rely primarily on patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property we regularly file patent applications to protect inventions arising from our research and development and are currently pursuing such patent applications in various countries in accordance with our strategy for intellectual property in that jurisdiction our existing patents and future patents could be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents or if patents are issued to us such patents may not be sufficient to provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies 

we also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position although we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our associates and third parties to protect our intellectual property such confidentiality agreements are limited in duration and could be breached and may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary manufacturing expertise adequate remedies may not be available in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise in addition others may obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or legal means the failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes equipment technology trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise methods and compounds could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries especially any developing countries into which we may expand our operations in some countries we have not applied for patent trademark or copyright protection 

  

third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary technologies or other intellectual property rights which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology can be difficult and expensive also litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others we cannot assure you that the outcome of such potential litigation will be in our favor such litigation may be costly and may divert management attention and other resources away from our business an adverse determination in any such litigation may impair our intellectual property rights and may harm our business prospects and reputation in addition we have no insurance coverage against such litigation costs and would have to bear all costs arising from such litigation to the extent we are unable to recover them from other parties 

some of our key raw materials and components are either singlesourced or sourced from a limited number of thirdparty suppliers and their failure to perform could cause manufacturing delays and impair our ability to deliver solar modules to customers in the required quality and quantities and at a price that is profitable to us 

our failure to obtain raw materials and components that meet our quality quantity and cost requirements in a timely manner could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture our solar modules or increase our manufacturing cost some of our key raw materials and components are either singlesourced or sourced from a limited number of thirdparty suppliers as a result the failure of any of our suppliers to perform could disrupt our supply chain and impair our operations in addition some of our suppliers are small companies that may be unable to supply our increasing demand for raw materials and components as we continue to expand rapidly we may be unable to identify new suppliers or qualify their products for use on our production lines in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms a constraint on our production may cause us to be unable to meet our capacity ramp plan andor our obligations under our customer contracts which would have an adverse impact on our financial results 

 29 

a disruption in our supply chain for cadmium telluride our cdte semiconductor material could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture solar modules and could adversely impact our profitability and longterm growth prospects 

a key raw material we use in our cdte module production process is a cadmium telluride compound tellurium one of the main components of cadmium telluride is mainly produced as a byproduct of copper refining and therefore its supply is largely dependent upon demand for copper our supply of cadmium telluride could be limited if any of our current suppliers or any of our future suppliers are unable to acquire an adequate supply of tellurium in a timely manner or at commercially reasonable prices if our competitors begin to use or increase their demand for cadmium telluride supply could be reduced and prices could increase if our current suppliers or any of our future suppliers cannot obtain sufficient tellurium they could substantially increase prices or be unable to perform under their contracts we may be unable to pass increases in the cost of our raw materials through to our customers a substantial increase in tellurium prices could adversely impact our profitability and longterm growth objectives 

  

our tetrasun module offering may not be able to achieve profitable commercial scale which could adversely impact our operating results and our future growth strategy with respect to pv solar in restricted spaces 

in 2013 we acquired tetrasun inc a development stage company with high efficiency crystalline silicon technology we expect our highpower density tetrasun modules to offer advantages relative to our cdte modules in commercial  industrial rooftop and other space constrained applications although we began manufacturing tetrasun modules during the fourth quarter of 2014 we are not experienced with crystalline silicon module manufacturing compared to many of our competitors and accordingly we face numerous risks and uncertainties many of these risks are inherent in pv module manufacturing generally or otherwise similar to risks involved in our cdte pv module manufacturing operations and are discussed elsewhere in item 1a “risk factors” 

additionally scaling of highvolume tetrasun module manufacturing could present supply chain timing and other challenges contrasted with our largely automated cdte manufacturing lines our tetrasun module manufacturing operations involve a batch process and will not be fullyintegrated from initial feedstock to final module potentially resulting in timing cost supply and other constraints we will be outsourcing module assembly to a third party and any constraints such party faces in meeting our volume or quality requirements would negatively impact our ability to deliver modules to our customers tetrasun cells will be manufactured using ntype monocrystalline wafers we currently do not have polysilicon contracts in place and will rely on our wafer suppliers to contract feedstock in sufficient volumes to meet our demand marketdriven increases in polysilicon prices realized by our wafer suppliers or increases in wafer prices generally would increase first solars manufacturing costs and negatively impact margins on tetrasun modules 

if we are able to achieve highvolume manufacturing of tetrasun modules we may not have an adequate sales channel for such modules andor the prevailing average selling price or conversion efficiency of pv modules in general may have changed in such a manner as to make our tetrasun modules uncompetitive if our tetrasun modules are unable to achieve profitable commercial scale we may have to write down all or a portion of the assets related to this business area and our future growth strategy with respect to pv solar in restricted spaces could be adversely impacted which outcomes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our future success depends on our ability to effectively balance manufacturing production with market demand and when necessary continue to build new manufacturing plants over time in response to such demand and add production lines in a costeffective manner all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties 

our future success depends on our ability to effectively balance manufacturing production with market demand and increase both our manufacturing capacity and production throughput over time in a costeffective and efficient manner if we cannot do so we may be unable to expand our business decrease our manufacturing cost per watt maintain our competitive position satisfy our contractual obligations or sustain profitability see “an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may continue to cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations” our ability to expand production capacity is subject to significant risks and uncertainties including the following 

 

 

  30 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if any future production lines that we may build in the future are not built in line with our committed schedules it may impair any future growth plans if any future production lines do not achieve operating metrics similar to our existing production lines our solar modules could perform below expectations and cause us to lose customers 

if we are unable to systematically replicate our production lines as necessary over time and achieve and sustain similar operating metrics in our future production lines as we have achieved at our existing production lines our manufacturing capacity could be substantially constrained our manufacturing costs per watt could increase and this may impair our growth plans andor cause us to lose customers resulting in lower net sales higher liabilities and lower net income than we anticipate for instance future production lines could produce solar modules that have lower conversion efficiencies higher failure rates and higher rates of degradation than solar modules from our existing production lines and we could be unable to determine the cause of the lower operating metrics or develop and implement solutions to improve performance 

some of our manufacturing equipment is customized and sole sourced if our manufacturing equipment fails or if our equipment suppliers fail to perform under their contracts we could experience production disruptions and be unable to satisfy our contractual requirements 

some of our manufacturing equipment is customized to our production lines based on designs or specifications that we provide to the equipment manufacturer which then undertakes a specialized process to manufacture the custom equipment as a result the equipment is not readily available from multiple vendors and would be difficult to repair or replace if it were to become damaged or stop working if any piece of equipment fails production along the entire production line could be interrupted in addition the failure of our equipment suppliers to supply equipment in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms could delay our expansion plans and otherwise disrupt our production schedule or increase our manufacturing costs all of which would adversely impact our financial results 

we may be unable to manage the expansion of our operations effectively 

we expect to continue to expand our business in order to provide utilityscale pv generation to existing and new geographic markets and to maintain or increase market share to manage the continued expansion of our operations we will be required to continue to improve our operational and financial systems procedures and controls and expand train manage and retain our growing associate base our management will also be required to maintain and expand our relationships with customers suppliers and other third parties and attract new customers and suppliers in addition our current and planned operations personnel systems and internal controls and procedures might be inadequate to support our future growth the effectiveness of our controls and procedures could be adversely impacted as we transfer more business functions to lower cost geographies as part of our cost reduction initiatives if we cannot manage our growth effectively we may be unable to take advantage of market opportunities execute our business strategies or respond to competitive pressures 

 31 

our substantial international operations subject us to a number of risks including unfavorable political regulatory labor and tax conditions in foreign countries 

we have significant marketing distribution and manufacturing operations both within and outside the united states we expect to continue to expand our operations worldwide as a result we will be subject to the legal political social tax and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions risks inherent to international operations include but are not limited to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

our business in foreign markets requires us to respond to rapid changes in market conditions in these countries our overall success as a global business depends in part on our ability to succeed in differing legal regulatory economic social and political conditions we may not be able to develop and implement policies and strategies that will be effective in each location where we do business 

 32 

risks related to our systems business 

project development or construction activities may not be successful and projects under development may not receive required permits real property rights ppas interconnection and transmission arrangements or financing or construction may not commence or proceed as scheduled which could increase our costs and impair our ability to recover our investments 

the development and construction of solar power electric generation facilities and other energy infrastructure projects involve numerous risks we may be required to spend significant sums for land and interconnection rights preliminary engineering permitting legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built success in developing a particular project is contingent upon among other things 

 

 

 

 

negotiation of satisfactory epc agreements 

 

 

 

 

 

 

successful completion of a particular project may be adversely affected delayed andor rendered infeasible by numerous factors including

if we are unable to complete the development of a solar power facility we fail to meet one or more agreed target construction milestone dates any agreed upon systemlevel capacity or energy output guarantees or warranties including for some projects twentyfive year energy performance or systemlevel module degradation warranties or other contract terms or our projects cause grid interference or other damage we may be subject to forfeiture of significant deposits under ppas or interconnection agreements or termination of such agreements significant liquidated damages penalties andor other obligations under the epc agreement or other agreements relating to the project including obligations to repair replace andor supplement additional modules and balance of system materials for the project particularly if our liabilities are not capped under the terms of such agreement and we typically will not be able to recover our investment in the project some of these penalties might require us to repurchase the project from the buyer or to downsize the project under certain circumstances if we were required to repurchase a project we may have insufficient cash or capital resources necessary to make the repurchase payment or we may be unable to resell the project in a timely manner or on terms commercially satisfactory to us which would adversely impact our results of operations some of these investments are included as assets on our consolidated balance sheet under the line item “project assets” if we are unable to complete the development of a solar power project we may writedown or writeoff some or all of these capitalized investments which would have an adverse impact on our net income in the period in which the loss is recognized in 2015 we expect to invest a significant amount of capital to develop projects owned by us or third parties which may limit the availability of capital to use for other purposes such as contract damages or repurchase payments 

we may enter into fixedprice epc contracts in which we act as the general contractor for our customers in connection with the installation of their solar power systems all essential costs are estimated at the time of entering into the epc contract for a particular project and these are reflected in the overall fixedprice that we charge our customers for the project these cost estimates are preliminary and may or may not be covered by contracts between us or the subcontractors suppliers and other parties to the project in addition we require qualified licensed subcontractors to install most of our systems shortages of such skilled labor could significantly delay a project or otherwise increase our costs should miscalculations in planning a project occur including those due to unexpected increases in inflation commodity prices or labor costs or delays in execution occur and we are unable to increase commensurately the epc sales price we may not achieve our expected margins or we may be required to record a loss in the relevant fiscal period 

we may be unable to acquire or lease land obtain necessary interconnection and transmission rights andor obtain the approvals licenses permits and electric transmission grid interconnection and transmission rights necessary to build and operate pv power plants in a timely and cost effective manner and regulatory agencies local communities labor unions or other third parties may delay prevent or increase the cost of construction and operation of the pv plants we intend to build 

in order to construct and operate our pv plants we need to acquire or lease land and rights of way obtain interconnection rights and obtain all necessary local county state federal and foreign approvals licenses and permits as well as rights to interconnect the plants to the transmission grid and transmit energy generated from the plant we may be unable to acquire the land or lease interests needed may not obtain satisfactory interconnection rights may not receive or retain the requisite approvals permits licenses and interconnection and transmission rights or may encounter other problems which could delay or prevent us from successfully constructing and operating pv plants 

  

many of our proposed pv plants are located on or require access through public lands administered by federal and state agencies pursuant to competitive public leasing and rightofway procedures and processes the authorization for the use construction and operation of pv plants and associated transmission facilities on federal state and private lands will also require the assessment and evaluation of mineral rights private rightsofway and other easements environmental agricultural cultural recreational and aesthetic impacts and the likely mitigation of adverse impacts to these and other resources and uses the inability to obtain the required permits and potentially excessive delay in obtaining such permits due for example to litigation or third 

 34 

party appeals could prevent us from successfully constructing and operating pv plants in a timely manner and could result in a potential forfeiture of any deposit we have made with respect to a given project moreover project approvals subject to project modifications and conditions including mitigation requirements and costs could affect the financial success of a given project 

in addition local labor unions may increase the cost of andor lower the productivity of project development in california and elsewhere we may also be subject to labor unavailability andor increased union labor requirements due to multiple simultaneous projects in a geographic region 

lack of transmission capacity availability potential upgrade costs to the transmission grid and other systems constraints could significantly impact our ability to build pv plants and generate solar electricity power sales 

  

in order to deliver electricity from our pv plants to our customers our projects generally need to connect to the transmission grid the lack of available capacity on the transmission grid could substantially impact our projects and cause reductions in project size delays in project implementation increases in costs from transmission upgrades and potential forfeitures of any deposit we have made with respect to a given project these transmission issues as well as issues relating to the availability of large systems such as transformers and switch gear could significantly impact our ability to build pv plants and generate solar electricity sales 

  

our systems business is largely dependent on us and third parties arranging financing from various sources which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms or in insufficient amounts 

  

the construction of the large utilityscale solar power projects under development by us is expected in many cases to require project financing including nonrecourse project debt financing in the bank loan market and institutional debt capital markets uncertainties exist as to whether our projects will be able to access the debt markets in a magnitude sufficient to finance their construction if we are unable to arrange such financing or if it is only available on unfavorable terms we may be unable to fully execute our systems business plan in addition we generally expect to sell our projects by raising project equity capital from tax oriented strategic industry and other equity investors such equity sources may not be available or may only be available in insufficient amounts in which case our ability to sell our projects may be delayed or limited and our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected even if such financing sources are available the counterparty to many of our fixedprice epc contracts which own the project we are constructing are often special purpose vehicles that do not have significant assets other than their interests in the project and have pledged all or substantially all of these assets to secure the projectrelated debt and certain other sources of financing if the owner defaults on its payment or other obligations to us we may face difficulties in collecting payment of amounts due to us for the costs previously incurred or for the amounts previously expended or committed to be expended to purchase equipment or supplies including intercompany purchases of pv modules or for termination payments we are entitled to under the terms of the related epc contract if we are unable to collect the amounts owed to us or are unable to complete the project because of an owner default we may be required to record a charge against earnings related to the project which could result in a material loss 

  

in addition for projects to which we provide epc services but are not the project developer our epc activities are in many cases dependent on the ability of third parties to finance their pv plant projects which in turn is dependent on their ability to obtain financing for such purchases on acceptable terms depending on prevailing conditions in the credit markets interest rates and other factors such financing may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms or in insufficient amounts if third parties are limited in their ability to access financing to support their purchase of pv power plant construction services from us we may not realize the cash flows that we expect from such sales and this could adversely affect our ability to invest in our business andor generate revenue see also the risk factor above entitled “an increase in interest rates or lending rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets including a reduction in total tax equity availability could make it difficult for endusers to finance the cost of a pv system and could reduce the demand for our solar modules andor lead to a reduction in the average selling price for pv modules  ” 

  

developing solar power projects may require significant upfront investment prior to the signing of an epc contract and commencing construction which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

our solar power project development cycles which span the time between the identification of land and the commercial operation of a pv power plant project vary substantially and can take many months or years to mature as a result of these long project cycles we may need to make significant upfront investments of resources including for example payments for land rights large transmission and ppa deposits or other payments which may be nonrefundable in advance of the signing of epc contracts and commencing construction and the receipt of any revenue much of which is not recognized for several additional months or years following contract signing our potential inability to enter into sales contracts with potential customers after making such upfront investments could adversely affect our business and results of operations furthermore we may become 

 35 

constrained in our ability to simultaneously fund our other business operations and these systems investments through our long project development cycles 

our liquidity may be adversely affected to the extent the project sale market weakens and we are unable to sell our solar projects on pricing terms and timing commercially acceptable to us in such a scenario we may choose to continue to own and operate certain solar power plants for a period of time after which the project assets may be sold to third parties in such cases the delayed disposition of projects could require us to recognize a gain on the sale of assets instead of recognizing revenue 

we may not be able to obtain longterm contracts for the sale of power produced by our projects at prices and on other terms favorable to attract financing and other investments 

obtaining longterm contracts for the sale of power produced by the projects at prices and on other terms favorable to us is essential for obtaining financing and commencing construction of our projects we must compete for ppas against other developers of solar and renewable energy projects further other sources of power such as natural gasfired power plants have historically been cheaper than the cost of solar power and power from certain types of projects such as natural gasfired power plants can be delivered on a firm basis the inability to compete successfully against other power producers or otherwise enter into ppas favorable to us would negatively affect our ability to develop and finance our projects and negatively impact our revenue in addition the availability of ppas is a function of a number of economic regulatory tax and public policy factors in addition certain of our projects may be scheduled for substantial completion prior to the commencement of a longterm ppa with a major offtaker in which case we would be required to enter into a stubperiod ppa for the intervening time period or sell down the project we may not be able to do either on terms that are commercially attractive to us 

we may be subject to unforeseen costs liabilities or obligations when providing om services 

we may provide ongoing om services to system owners under fixedprice longterm service agreements pursuant to which we generally perform all scheduled and unscheduled maintenance for the system perform operating and other asset management services for the system and provide an availability guarantee for the system our costs to perform these services are estimated at the time of entering into the om agreement for a particular project and these are reflected in the fixedprice that we charge our customers under the om agreement we do not have extensive experience in performing om services for pv solar power plants in foreign jurisdictions in which we plan to offer pv systems solutions as part of our long term strategic plan ie outside of the united states canada and australia including estimating actual costs for such jurisdictions under our om agreements relative to the price that we charge our customers should miscalculations in estimating these costs occur including those due to unexpected increases in inflation or labor or bos costs our growth strategy and results of operations could be adversely affected because of the longterm nature of these om agreements the adverse impacts on results of operations could be significant particularly if our liabilities are not capped or subject to an abovemarket liability cap under the terms of the om agreement we also could be subject to substantial costs liabilities or obligations in the event our solar systems do not meet any agreedupon systemlevel availability or performance warranties 

our systems business is subject to regulatory oversight and liability if we fail to operate our solar systems in compliance with electric reliability rules 

the ongoing om services that we provide for system owners may subject us to regulation by the north american electric reliability corporation “nerc” or its designated regional representative as a “generator operator” or “gop” under electric reliability rules filed with ferc our failure to comply with the reliability rules applicable to gops could subject us to substantial fines by nerc subject to ferc’s review in addition the system owners that receive our om services may be regulated by nerc as “generator owners” or “gos” and we may incur liability for go violations and fines levied by nerc subject to ferc’s review based on the terms of our om agreements finally as a systems owner and operator we may in the future be subject to regulation by nerc as a go

other risks 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future business combinations or transactions and integration of these business combinations may disrupt our business and management 

we have made several acquisitions in the last several years and in the future we may acquire additional companies project pipelines products or technologies or enter into joint ventures or other strategic initiatives such as the potential joint venture yieldco transaction described under item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – certain trends and uncertainties – yieldco” we may not realize the anticipated benefits of a business combination and each transaction has numerous risks these risks include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mergers and acquisitions of companies are inherently risky and ultimately if we do not complete the integration of acquired businesses successfully and in a timely manner we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions to the extent anticipated which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we may be unable to successfully form the previously announced yieldco vehicle the proposed initial public offering of the yieldco vehicle may not occur on favorable terms or at all and even if the proposed initial public offering is completed we may not achieve the expected benefits 

on february 23 2015 we announced that we were in advanced negotiations with sunpower corporation “sunpower” to form a joint venture yieldco vehicle the “yieldco” into which we and sunpower each expect to contribute a portfolio of selected solar generation assets from our existing portfolios of assets upon execution of a master formation agreement we and sunpower 

 37 

intend to file a registration statement with the sec for an initial public offering of limited partner interests in the yieldco the “ipo” we and sunpower may not successfully form the yieldco which is subject to each party’s board and regulatory approval and execution of definitive documentation as well as the completion of the proposed ipo in addition the completion of the proposed ipo is itself subject to numerous conditions including market conditions and may not occur on favorable terms or at all 

our stock price could fluctuate significantly in response to developments relating to the proposed ipo or other action or market speculation regarding the proposed ipo in addition the ipo process will divert the attention of management and will result in a substantial increase in general and administrative expense for thirdparty consultants and advisors including legal counsel and accountants if the proposed ipo is not completed we will have expended managements time and incurred significant expenses for which we will not receive any benefit 

if the proposed ipo is completed we may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the proposed yieldco on a timely basis or at all we believe that the viability of the yieldco strategy will depend among other things on our ability to continue to develop revenuegenerating solar assets which is subject to the same projectlevel business and industry risks described in this “risk factors” section and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k furthermore if the ipo is completed the value of our investment in the yieldco will fluctuate and may decline as a result we may never recover the value of the assets we expect to contribute to the yieldco and we may realize less of a return on such contribution than if we had retained or operated these assets if we are unable to complete the proposed ipo or if we are unable to achieve the strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the proposed ipo our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

our future success depends on our ability to retain our key associates and to successfully integrate them into our management team 

we are dependent on the services of our executive officers and other members of our senior management team the loss of one or more of these key associates or any other member of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on us we may not be able to retain or replace these key associates and we may not have adequate succession plans in place several of our current key associates including our executive officers are subject to employment conditions or arrangements that contain postemployment noncompetition provisions however these arrangements permit the associates to terminate their employment with us upon little or no notice and the enforceability of the noncompetition provisions in certain jurisdictions is uncertain 

if we are unable to attract train and retain key personnel our business may be materially and adversely affected 

our future success depends to a significant extent on our ability to attract train and retain management operations sales training and technical personnel including in foreign jurisdictions as we continue to execute on our long term strategic plan recruiting and retaining capable personnel particularly those with expertise in the pv industry across a variety of technologies are vital to our success there is substantial competition for qualified technical personnel and while we continue to benchmark our organization against the broad spectrum of business in our market space to remain economically competitive there can be no assurances that we will be able to attract and retain our technical personnel if we are unable to attract and retain qualified associates or otherwise experience unexpected labor disruptions within our business we may be materially and adversely affected 

labor used on some of our job sites that are completed or under construction are subject to the davisbacon act the davisbacon act requires that personnel assigned to the project be paid at least the prevailing wage and fringe benefits as established by and in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the us department of labor “dol” we have an established policy pursuant to which we evaluate davisbacon act requirements in conjunction with our subcontractors on the project and ensure our collective compliance with these requirements if it was ultimately determined that any person working under davisbacon requirements on first solar projects was not properly classified was being paid the incorrect prevailing wage or had not been paid fringe benefits to which he was entitled we could incur additional liability with respect to such worker for example the agua caliente project we recently concluded in southwestern arizona has been undergoing a dol davisbacon act compliance review the ultimate outcome of that compliance review is uncertain at this time any such liability incurred above our anticipated costs for these services could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we may be exposed to infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties which if determined adversely to us could cause us to pay significant damage awards or prohibit us from the manufacture and sale of our solar modules or the use of our technology 

our success depends largely on our ability to use and develop our technology and knowhow without infringing or misappropriating the intellectual property rights of third parties the validity and scope of claims relating to pv technology patents 

 38 

involve complex scientific legal and factual considerations and analysis and therefore may be highly uncertain we may be subject to litigation involving claims of patent infringement or violation of intellectual property rights of third parties the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits patent opposition proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings can be both costly and time consuming and may significantly divert the efforts and resources of our technical and management personnel an adverse determination in any such litigation or proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liability to third parties require us to seek licenses from third parties which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all or pay ongoing royalties require us to redesign our solar module or subject us to injunctions prohibiting the manufacture and sale of our solar modules or the use of our technologies protracted litigation could also result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of our solar modules until the resolution of such litigation 

currency translation and transaction risk may negatively affect our net sales cost of sales and gross margins and could result in exchange losses 

although our reporting currency is the us dollar we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most countries in which we operate as a result we are subject to currency translation and transaction risk for example 5  and 4  of our net sales were denominated in euros for 2014 and 2013  respectively and we expect more than a minor percentage of our net sales to be outside the united states and denominated in foreign currencies in the future in addition our operating expenses for our manufacturing plants located outside the us and our operations for our systems business in foreign countries will generally be denominated in the local currency joint ventures or other business arrangements with strategic partners outside of the united states have and are expected in the future to involve significant investments denominated in the local currency changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar could affect our net sales cost of sales and equity investments and could result in exchange gains or losses we cannot accurately predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations 

we could also expand our business into emerging markets many of which have an uncertain regulatory environment relating to currency policy conducting business in such emerging markets could cause our exposure to changes in exchange rates to increase due to the relatively high volatility associated with emerging market currencies and potentially longer payment terms for our proceeds 

our ability to hedge foreign currency exposure is dependent on our credit profile with the banks that are willing and able to do business with us deterioration in our credit position or a significant tightening of the credit market conditions could limit our ability to hedge our foreign currency exposure and therefore result in exchange gains or losses 

sustained declines in worldwide oil prices could adversely affect trading prices of our common shares 

worldwide oil prices have recently declined oil is used as a fuel for electricity generation in only a small percentage of applications worldwide compared to natural gas or coalfired electricity generation and other forms of electricity generation and accordingly fluctuations in oil prices generally do not have a significant direct causal effect on prevailing competitive electricity prices including electricity from solar sources nonetheless there can be an observed market correlation effect between declining oil prices and depressed equity valuations of solar companies if oil prices remain low or continue to decline the trading price of our common shares may suffer 

global sovereign debt issues could adversely impact our business 

potential sovereign debt issues in europe emerging markets and other regions and their impact on the balance sheets and lending practices of global banks in particular could negatively impact our access to and cost of capital and therefore could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and competitive position it could also similarly affect our customers and therefore limit the sales of our modules and demand for our systems business as well sovereign debt problems may also cause governments to reduce eliminate or allow to expire government subsidies and economic incentives for solar energy which could limit our growth or cause our net sales to decline and materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to litigation risks including securities class actions and stockholder derivative actions which may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain 

from time to time we are subject to legal claims with and without merit that may be costly and which may divert the attention of our management and our resources in general in addition our projects may be subject to litigation or other adverse proceedings that may adversely impact our ability to proceed with construction or sell a given project which would adversely affect our ability to recognize revenue with respect to such project the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict moreover 

 39 

many of the complaints filed against us do not specify the amount of damages that plaintiffs seek and we therefore are unable to estimate the possible range of damages that might be incurred should these lawsuits be resolved against us certain of these lawsuits assert types of claims that if resolved against us could give rise to substantial damages and an unfavorable outcome or settlement of one or more of these lawsuits or any future lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations even if these lawsuits or any future lawsuits are not resolved against us the costs of defending such lawsuits may be costly and may not be covered by our insurance policies because the price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile we can provide no assurance that additional securities litigation will not be filed against us in the future for more information on our legal proceedings including our securities class action and derivative actions see “ note 16 “commitments and contingencies”  under the heading “legal proceedings” of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2014 included in this annual report on form 10k 

our largest stockholder has significant influence over us and its interests may conflict with or differ from interests of other stockholders 

our largest stockholder consisting collectively of jcl fslr holdings llc and its beneficiaries and jtw trust no 1 uad 91902 and its beneficiaries each affiliated in the past with the former estate of john t walton collectively the “significant stockholder” owned approximately 27  of our outstanding common stock at december 31 2014  as a result the significant stockholder has substantial influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of our directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions such as mergers tender offers and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets the interests of the significant stockholder could conflict with or differ from interests of other stockholders for example the concentration of ownership held by the significant stockholder could delay defer or prevent a change of control of our company or impede a merger takeover or other business combination which a majority of stockholders may view favorably 

if our goodwill and other intangible assets or project assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 

we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements should we determine that our goodwill other intangible assets eg in process research and development “iprd” or project assets are impaired such a charge might have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 

  

as required by accounting rules we review our goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill is less than its carrying value factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill might not be recoverable include a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant decline in projections of future cash flows and lower future growth rates in our industry 

we review iprd for impairment on a quarterly basis to determine if the project has been abandoned if the project has been determined to be abandoned or not recoverable we would be required to impair the respective iprd project we review project assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable we consider a project commercially viable and recoverable if it is anticipated to be sellable for a profit once it is either fully developed or fully constructed if our projects are not considered commercially viable we would be required to impair the respective project assets 

unanticipated changes in our tax provisions the adoption of a new us tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge for inventory services licenses funding and other items in intercompany transactions we are subject to potential tax examinations in these various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges crossjurisdictional transfer pricing or other tax positions and assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these examinations in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these potential examinations and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of examinations could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows in addition our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure loss of our malaysian tax holiday changes in the mix of earnings in countries with tax holidays or differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process a number of proposals for broad reform of the corporate tax system in the us are under evaluation by various legislative and administrative bodies but it is not possible to determine accurately the overall impact of such proposals on our effective tax rate at this time 

 40 

cyber attacks or other breaches of our information systems or those of third parties with which we do business could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our operations rely on our computer systems hardware software and networks as well as those of the third parties with which we do business to securely process store and transmit proprietary confidential and other information including intellectual property such information systems may be compromised by cyber attacks computer viruses and other events that put the security of our information and that of the third parties with which we do business at risk of misappropriation or destruction such cyber incidents have become increasingly frequent and sophisticated targeting or otherwise affecting a wide range of companies in recent years while we have instituted security measures to minimize the likelihood and impact of a cyber incident there is no assurance that these measures or those of the third parties with which we do business will be adequate in the future if these measures fail valuable information may be lost our manufacturing construction om and other operations may be disrupted and our reputation may suffer we may also be subject to litigation regulatory action remedial expenses and financial losses beyond the scope or limits of our insurance coverage these consequences of a failure of security measures could individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our credit agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business 

we may be unable to respond to changes in business and economic conditions engage in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us and obtain additional financing if needed because our revolving credit facility and our malaysian facility agreements contain and any of our other future debt agreements may contain covenant restrictions that limit our ability to among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

under our revolving credit facility and our malaysian facility agreements we are also subject to certain financial covenants our ability to comply with covenants under our credit agreements is dependent on our future performance which will be subject to many factors some of which are beyond our control including prevailing economic conditions in addition our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under these agreements and any of our other future debt agreements which if not cured or waived could permit the holders thereof to accelerate such debt and could cause crossdefaults under our other facility agreements and the possible acceleration of debt under such other facility agreements as well as crossdefaults under certain of our key project and operational agreements and could also result in requirements to post additional security instruments to secure future obligations in addition we cannot assure you that events that occur within the company or in the industry or the economy as a whole will not constitute material adverse effects under these agreements if it is determined that a material adverse effect has occurred the lenders can under certain circumstances restrict future borrowings or accelerate the due date of outstanding loan balances if any of our debt is accelerated we may in the future not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt and we may experience crossdefaults under our other debt agreements or project and key operational agreements which could materially and negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations

the solar industry continues to be characterized by intense pricing competition both at the module and system levels in the aggregate we believe manufacturers of solar modules and cells have installed significant production capacity in relation to global demand we believe the solar industry will continue to experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity exceeds global demand and that such periods will put pressure on pricing additionally intense competition at the systems level can result in an environment in which pricing falls rapidly thereby further increasing demand for solar solutions but constraining the ability for project developers epc companies andor verticallyintegrated solar companies such as first solar to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability in light of such market realities we continue to execute our long term strategic plan described below under which we are focusing on our competitive strengths a key core strength is our differentiated vertically integrated business model that enables us to provide utilityscale pv generation solutions to sustainable geographic markets that have an immediate need for massscale pv electricity 

solar markets worldwide continue to develop in part aided by demand elasticity resulting from declining industry average selling prices both at the module and system level which make solar power more affordable to new markets and we have continued to develop our localized presence and expertise in these markets we are developing constructing or operating multiple solar projects around the world many of them the largest or among the largest in their regions including 

 

 

 

 

in north america we continue to execute on our advancedstage utilityscale project pipeline we continue to make construction progress on what are currently or will be among the world’s largest pv solar power systems we expect a substantial portion of our consolidated net sales operating income and cash flows through the end of 2016 to be derived from these projects we continue to advance the development and selling efforts for the other projects included in our advancedstage utilityscale project pipeline and we continue to develop our earlytomid stage project pipeline and evaluate acquisitions of projects to continue to add to our advancedstage utilityscale project pipeline 

lower industry module and system pricing while currently challenging for certain solar manufacturers particularly manufacturers with high cost structures is expected to continue to contribute to global market diversification and volume elasticity over time declining average selling prices are consistent with the erosion of one of the primary historical constraints to widespread solar market penetration its affordability in the near term however declining average selling prices could adversely affect our results of operations if competitors reduce pricing to levels below their costs bid aggressively low prices for ppas and epc agreements or are able to operate at negative or minimal operating margins for sustained periods of time our results of operations could be further adversely affected we continue to mitigate this uncertainty in part by executing on and building our advancedstage utilityscale systems pipeline executing on our module efficiency improvement and bos cost reduction roadmaps to maintain

and increase our competitiveness profitability and capital efficiency adjusting our production plans and capacity utilization and continuing the development of worldwide geographic markets 

in the components business we continue to face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules and other types of solar modules and pv systems solar module manufacturers compete with one another in several product performance attributes including reliability and selling price per watt and with respect to solar power systems net present value “npv” return on equity “roe” and levelized cost of electricity “lcoe” meaning the net present value of total life cycle costs of the solar power project divided by the quantity of energy which is expected to be produced over the system’s life we believe we are among the lowest cost pv module manufacturers in the solar industry on a module cost per watt basis based on publicly available information this cost competitiveness is reflected in the price at which we sell our modules and fully integrated pv solar power systems and enables our pv solar power systems to compete favorably our cost competitiveness is based in large part on our proprietary technology which enables conversion efficiency improvements and enables us to produce a module in less than 25 hours using a continuous and highly automated industrial manufacturing process as opposed to a batch process our scale and our operational excellence in addition our cdte modules use approximately 12 of the amount of the polysilicon that is used to manufacture traditional crystalline silicon solar modules the cost of polysilicon is a significant driver of the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules and the timing and rate of change in the cost of silicon feedstock and polysilicon could lead to changes in solar module pricing levels polysilicon costs have had periods of decline over the past several years contributing to a decline in our manufacturing cost competitiveness over traditional crystalline silicon module manufacturers given the lower conversion efficiency and smaller size sometimes referred to as form factor of our modules compared to certain types of crystalline silicon modules there may be higher bos costs associated with systems using our modules thus to compete effectively on the basis of lcoe our modules need to maintain a certain cost advantage per watt compared to crystalline siliconbased modules with higher conversion efficiencies we continue to focus on reducing bos costs associated with pv solar power systems using our modules we believe we can continue to reduce bos costs by improving module conversion efficiency leveraging volume procurement around standardized hardware platforms using innovative installation techniques and know how and accelerating installation times to reduce labor costs bos costs can represent a significant portion of the costs associated with the construction of a typical utilityscale pv solar power system 

while our modules and pv solar power systems are generally competitive in cost reliability and performance attributes there can be no guarantee such competitiveness will continue to exist in the future to the same extent or at all any declines in the competitiveness of our products could result in additional margin compression further declines in the average selling prices of our solar modules and pv solar power systems erosion in our market share for modules and pv solar power systems decreases in the rate of net sales growth andor declines in overall net sales we have taken and continue to take various actions to mitigate the potential impact resulting from competitive pressures including accelerating progress along our module efficiency improvement and bos cost reduction roadmaps and further focusing our research and development on increasing the conversion efficiency of our solar modules 

as we continue to expand our systems business into sustainable markets we can offer value beyond the solar module reduce our exposure to moduleonly competition provide differentiated product offerings to minimize the impact of solar module commoditization and provide comprehensive utilityscale pv solar power system solutions that significantly reduce solar electricity costs thus our systems business allows us to play a more active role than many of our competitors in managing the demand for our solar modules finally we continue to form and develop strong relationships with our customers and strategic partners around the world and continue to develop our range of product offerings including epc capabilities and om services in order to enhance the competitiveness of systems using our solar modules for example we have and expect in the future to form joint ventures or other business arrangements with project developers in certain strategic markets in order to provide our modules and potential systems business pv generation solutions to the projects developed by such ventures 

certain trends and uncertainties 

we believe that our continuing operations may be favorably or unfavorably impacted by the following trends and uncertainties that may affect our financial condition and results of operations see item 1a “risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of other risks that may affect our financial condition and results of operations 

long term strategic plan 

in executing our long term strategic plan we are focusing on providing solar pv generation solutions using our modules to sustainable geographic markets that we believe have a compelling need for massscale pv electricity including markets throughout the americas asia australia the middle east and africa as part of our long term strategic plan we are focusing on opportunities in which our solar pv generation solutions can compete directly with fossil fuel offerings on an lcoe or similar basis or complement such fossil fuel electricity generations execution of the long term strategic plan entails a reallocation of resources 

 49 

around the globe in particular dedicating resources to regions such as latin america asia the middle east and africa we are evaluating and closely managing the appropriate level of resources required as we transition into and penetrate these specific markets we have and intend to continue to dedicate significant capital and human resources to reduce the total installed cost of solar pv generation to optimize the design and logistics around our solar pv generation solutions and to ensure that our solutions integrate well into the overall electricity ecosystem of each specific market 

we expect that over time an increasing portion of our consolidated net sales operating income and cash flows will come from solar offerings in the sustainable markets described above as we execute on our long term strategic plan the timing execution and financial impacts of our long term strategic plan are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the risk factors we are focusing our resources in those markets and energy applications in which solar power can be a leastcost bestfit energy solution particularly in regions with high solar resources significant current or projected electricity demand andor relatively high existing electricity prices as part of these efforts we continue to expand resources globally including the appointment of country heads business development sales personnel and other supporting professional staff in target sustainable markets accordingly we are shifting current costs and expect to incur additional costs over time as we establish a localized business presence in these regions 

joint ventures or other business arrangements with strategic partners are a key part of our long term strategic plan and we use such arrangements to expedite our penetration of various markets and establish relationships with potential customers and policymakers some of these business arrangements involve and are expected in the future to involve significant investments or other allocations of capital we continue to develop relationships with policymakers regulators and end customers in each of these markets with a view to creating markets for utility scale pv solar power systems we sell solar power solutions directly to end customers including independent power producers utilities retail electricity providers and commercial and industrial customers depending on the market opportunity our sales offerings range from module only sales to module sales with a range of development epc services and other solutions to full turnkey pv solar power system sales we expect these sales offerings to continue to evolve over time as we work with our customers to optimize how our pv solar generation solutions can best meet our customers’ energy and economic needs in addition to our utilityscale power plant offerings we have fuel displacement commercial industrial and offgrid and energy access offerings 

in order to create or maintain a market position in certain strategically targeted markets our offerings from time to time may need to be competitively priced at levels associated with minimal gross profit margins which may adversely affect our results of operations we expect the profitability associated with our various sales offerings to vary from one another over time and possibly vary from our internal longrange profitability expectations and targets depending on the market opportunity and the relative competitiveness of our offering compared with other energy solutions fossil fuel based or otherwise that are available to potential customers 

we expect to use our working capital the availability under our revolving credit facility or nonrecourse or limitedrecourse project financing to finance the construction of certain of our pv solar power systems if the sale of such systems prior to the commencement of construction does not meet our economic return expectations or we cannot sell under terms and conditions that are favorable to us from time to time we may own and operate certain pv solar power systems often with the intention to sell at a later date the ability to do so allows us to gain control of the sales process provide a lower risk profile to a future buyer of a pv solar power system and improve our ability to drive higher eventual sale values we may also elect to construct and retain ownership interests in power plants for which there is no ppa with an offtaker such as a utility but rather an intent to sell the electricity produced by the plant in a competitive wholesale market we continue to pursue strategic partnerships that open up new geographic markets we also continue to assess and pursue other business arrangements that provide access to a lower cost of capital and optimize the value of our projects business arrangements that can lower the cost of capital and provide other benefits relating to the project sales process such as yieldco arrangements as described below and under the heading “liquidity and capital resources” have been used increasingly by renewable energy companies additionally our joint ventures and other business arrangements with strategic partners have and may in the future result in us temporarily retaining a minority or noncontrolling ownership interest in the underlying systems projects we develop supply modules to or construct potentially for a period of up to several years such business arrangements could become increasingly important to our competitive profile in markets globally including north america in each of the above mentioned examples we may retain such ownership interests in a consolidated andor unconsolidated separate entity 

yieldco 

on february 23 2015 we and sunpower announced that we are in advanced negotiations to form a joint yieldco to which the parties each expect to contribute a portfolio of selected solar generation assets from their existing portfolios of assets upon the execution of a master formation agreement the parties intend to file a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for an initial public offering of limited partner interests in the yieldco formation of the yieldco and completion of 

 50 

the ipo are subject to among other things the execution of definitive documentation each party’s board approval and regulatory approval there is no assurance that the yieldco will be formed or that the ipo will be consummated or that any other transaction will occur 

construction of some of the world’s largest pv solar power systems 

we continue to execute on our advancedstage utilityscale project pipeline we expect a substantial portion of our consolidated net sales operating income and cash flows through 2016 to be derived from several large projects including the following projects which will be among the world’s largest pv solar power systems the 250 mw mccoy solar energy project located in riverside county california the 250 mw silver state south project located near primm in clark county nevada and the 150 mw imperial solar energy center west project located in imperial county california which are all under contract and the following projects which are not yet sold or contracted the 300 mw stateline project located in san bernardino county california the 280mw california flats project located in monterey county california the 250 mw moapa project located in clark county nevada and the 141 mw luz del norte project located near copiapó chile please see the tables under “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationssystems project pipeline” for additional information about these and other projects within our systems business advancedstage project pipeline the construction progress of these projects is subject to risks and delays as described in the risk factors revenue recognition for these and other systems projects is in many cases not linear in nature due to the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria have been or are expected to be met and consequently periodoverperiod comparisons of results of operations may not be meaningful as we progress construction towards substantial completion of these pv solar power systems we may have a larger portion of our net sales operating income and cash flows come from future sales of solar offerings outside of north america pursuant to our long term strategic plan described above north america however will continue to represent a meaningful portion of our net sales operating income and cash flows through 2016 as a significant portion of our advancedstage project pipeline excluding the projects above is also comprised of projects in north america 

systems project pipeline 

the following tables summarize as of february 24 2015  our approximately 32 gw  systems business advancedstage project pipeline as of december 31 2014  for the projects sold under contract in our advancedstage project pipeline of approximately 15 gw  we have recognized revenue with respect to the equivalent of approximately 02 gw  such mw equivalent amount refers to the ratio of revenue recognized for the projects sold under contract in our advancedstage project pipeline compared to total contracted revenue for such projects multiplied by the total mw for such projects the remaining revenue to be recognized subsequent to december 31 2014  for the projects sold under contract in our advancedstage project pipeline is expected to be approximately 30 billion  the substantial majority of this amount is expected to be recognized as revenue through the later of the substantial completion or project closing dates of the projects sold under contract the remaining revenue to be recognized does not have a direct correlation to expected remaining module shipments for such projects sold under contract as expected module shipments do not represent total systems revenues and do not consider the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria are met including the timing of module installation the actual volume of modules installed in our projects sold under contract will be greater than the project size in mw ac as module volumes required for a project are based upon mw dc which will be greater than the mw ac size pursuant to a dcac ratio typically ranging from 12 to 14 such ratio varies across different projects due to various system design factors projects are removed from our advancedstage project pipeline tables below once we have completed construction and after all revenue has been recognized 

we continually seek to make additions to our advancedstage project pipeline we are actively developing our early to midstage project pipeline in order to secure ppas and are also pursuing opportunities to acquire advancedstage projects which already have ppas in place from february 26 2014 through february 24 2015  we acquired 14  mw of advancedstage projects and we expect to acquire additional advancedstage projects when such acquisitions meet our strategic andor our return on investment requirements

results of operations 

the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  



segment overview 

we operate our business in two segments our components segment involves the design manufacture and sale of solar modules which convert sunlight into electricity we primarily manufacture cdte modules and have also begun manufacturing highefficiency crystalline silicon modules thirdparty customers of our components segment include project developers system integrators and owners and operators of pv solar power systems 

our second segment is our fully integrated systems segment through which we provide complete turnkey pv solar power systems or solar solutions that draw upon our capabilities which include i project development ii epc services iii om services and iv project finance expertise we may provide our full epc services or any combination of individual products and services within our epc capabilities depending upon the customer and market opportunity all of our systems segment products and services are for pv solar power systems which primarily use our solar modules and such products and services are sold directly to investor owned utilities independent power developers and producers commercial and industrial companies and other system owners additionally within our systems segment we may hold and operate certain of our pv solar power systems based on strategic opportunities 

  

in our reportable segment financial disclosures we include an allocation of net sales value for all solar modules manufactured by our components segment and installed in projects sold or built by our systems segment in the net sales of our components segment in the gross profit of our reportable segment disclosures we include the corresponding cost of sales value for the solar modules installed in projects sold or built by our systems segment in the components segment the cost of solar modules is comprised of the manufactured cost incurred by our components segment 

see note 24 “segment and geographical information”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2014  included in this annual report on form 10k 

see also item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations — systems project pipeline” for a description of the projects in our advancedstage project pipeline due to the distinct size profitability and terms of the underlying sales arrangements for each project under construction the timing of meeting all revenue recognition criteria may create uneven net sales and gross profit patterns making year over year comparisons less meaningful

product revenue 

the following table sets forth the total amounts of solar modules and solar power systems net sales for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  for the purpose of the following table a solar module revenue is composed of total net sales from the sale of solar modules to third parties and b solar power system revenue is composed of total net sales from the sale of pv solar power systems and related services and solutions including the solar modules installed in the pv solar power systems we develop and construct along with revenue generated from our pv solar power systems in thousands 



solar module revenue to third parties decreased by 1526 million  during 2014  compared to 2013  due to a 26 reduction in the volume of watts sold and a 19 decrease in the average selling price per watt 

solar power system revenue increased by 2354 million  during 2014  compared to 2013  primarily as a result of the number and size of projects under construction between these periods as well as the timing of when all the revenue recognition criteria have been met specifically the increase was attributable to higher revenue from the partial sale of our solar gen 2 project the sale of our campo verde and macho springs projects and the commencement of construction and related revenue recognition on multiple projects in california and our agl nyngan project in australia these increases were partially offset by decreases in systems business project revenue resulting from our desert sunlight project as it nears substantial completion our completed first phase of the imperial valley energy center south project our completed amherstburg belmont and walpole projects and the completion of the agua caliente project 

solar module revenue to third parties increased by 554 million  during 2013  compared to 2012  due to an increase in the volume of watts sold of 39 partially offset by a 15 decrease in the average selling price per watt 

solar power system revenue decreased by 1150 million  for 2013  compared to 2012  primarily due to the number and size of projects under construction between these periods as well as the timing of when all the revenue recognition criteria have been met solar power system revenue included decreases in net sales from our av solar ranch one copper mountain 2 and topaz projects which are at various points of completion combined with reductions in net sales for the substantially completed agua caliente alpine silver state north avra valley and greenough river projects these decreases were partially offset by increases in net sales from the initial revenue recognition for our desert sunlight pnm and dewa projects combined with increases in net sales from our completed first phase of the imperial energy center south project and our projects in canada including amherstburg belmont and walpole 

net sales 

components business 

we generally price and sell our solar modules per watt of name plate power during 2014  a significant portion of net sales from the components business related to modules included in our pv solar power systems described below under “net sales — systems business” other than the modules included in our pv solar power systems we sold the majority of our solar modules to pv solar power system project developers system integrators and operators who own operate or construct solar projects in india great britain israel and the united states  

from time to time we enter into module sales agreements with customers worldwide for specific projects or volumes of modules such agreements are generally not longterm in nature during the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  39  and 48  respectively of our components business net sales excluding modules included in our pv solar power systems were denominated in euros and were subject to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and us dollar 

under our typical customer sales contracts for solar modules we transfer title and risk of loss to the customer and recognize revenue upon shipment pricing is typically fixed or determinable at the time of shipment and our customers do not typically have extended payment terms customers do not have rights of return under these contracts our revenue recognition policies for the components business are described further in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2014  included in this annual report on form 10k 

 55 

during 2014  southern company  midamerican energy company  and nextera energy inc  individually accounted for more than 10 of our components segment’s net sales which includes the solar modules used in our systems projects 

systems business 

through our fully integrated systems business we provide a complete turnkey solar power system solution using our solar modules which may include project development epc services om services and project finance expertise additionally from time to time we may own and operate pv solar power systems which will be included within our systems business revenue recognition for our systems projects are in many cases not linear in nature due to the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria are met and consequently period over period comparisons of results of operations may not be meaningful we typically use the percentageofcompletion method using actual costs incurred over total estimated costs to construct a project including module costs as our standard accounting policy but we only apply this method after all revenue recognition criteria have been met there are also many instances in which we recognize revenue only after a project has been completed primarily due to a project not being sold prior to completion or because all revenue recognition criteria are not met until the project is completed our revenue recognition policies for the systems business are described in further detail in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2014  included in this annual report on form 10k 

during 2014  2013  and 2012  the majority of our systems segment net sales were generated in north america 

during 2014  the principal customers of our systems segment were southern company  nextera energy inc  and midamerican energy company  each of which accounted for more than 10 of our systems segment sales 

the following table shows net sales by reportable segment for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  



the 3  increase in net sales during the year ended december 31 2014  compared with the year ended december 31 2013  was primarily due to a 7  increase in net sales from our systems segment partially offset by a 6  decrease in net sales from our components segment 

net sales from our components segment which includes solar modules used in our systems projects decreased by 713 million  due to a 12 decrease in average selling prices partially offset by a 7 increase in the volume of watts sold 

net sales from our systems segment which excludes solar modules used in our systems projects increased by 1541 million  primarily as a result of the number and size of projects under construction between these periods as well as the timing of when all the revenue recognition criteria have been met specifically the increase was attributable to higher revenue from the partial sale of our solar gen 2 project the sale of our campo verde and macho springs projects and the commencement of construction and related revenue recognition on multiple projects in california and our agl nyngan project in australia these increases were partially offset by decreases in systems business project revenue resulting from our desert sunlight project as it nears substantial completion our completed first phase of the imperial valley energy center south project our completed amherstburg belmont and walpole projects and the completion of the agua caliente project 

the 2  decrease in net sales during 2013  compared with 2012  was primarily due to a 2  decrease in net sales from our systems segment and a 1  decrease in net sales from our components segment 

net sales from our components segment which includes solar modules used in our systems projects decreased by 120 million  due to a 17 decrease in average selling prices partially offset by a 19 increase in the volume of watts sold 

 56 

net sales from our systems segment which excludes solar modules used in our systems projects decreased by 475 million  primarily due to the number and size of projects under construction between these periods as well as the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria have been met net sales from our systems segment included decreases in net sales from our av solar ranch one copper mountain 2 and topaz projects which are at various points of completion combined with reductions in net sales for the substantially completed agua caliente alpine silver state north avra valley and greenough river projects these decreases were partially offset by increases in net sales from initial revenue recognition for our desert sunlight pnm and dewa projects combined with increases in net sales from our completed first phase of the imperial energy center south project and our projects in canada including amherstburg belmont and walpole 

cost of sales   

components business 

our cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials and components for manufacturing solar modules such as glass transparent conductive coatings cadmium telluride and other thin film semiconductors laminate materials connector assemblies edge seal materials and other materials and components our cost of sales also includes direct labor for the manufacturing of solar modules and manufacturing overhead such as engineering equipment maintenance environmental health and safety quality and production control and procurement costs cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing plant and equipment and facilityrelated expenses in addition we record shipping warranty and the majority of our obligation for solar module collection and recycling costs within cost of sales 

as further described in note 24 “segment and geographical information”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2014  included within this annual report on form 10k at the time when all revenue recognition criteria are met we include the sale of our solar modules manufactured by our components business and used by our systems business within net sales of our components business therefore the related cost of sales is also included within our components business at that time 

systems business 

within our systems business projectrelated costs include standard epc costs consisting primarily of bos costs for inverters electrical and mounting hardware project management and engineering costs and engineering and construction labor costs site specific costs and development costs including transmission upgrade costs interconnection fees and permitting costs 

the following table shows cost of sales by reportable segment for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  



our cost of sales increased by 1185 million  or 5  and increased by 17 percentage points  as a percentage of net sales when comparing 2014  with 2013  the increase in cost of sales was driven by a 1948 million  increase in our systems segment cost of sales primarily for bos components and other construction and development costs related to the number of projects and the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria were met along with a mix of higher cost projects these increases were partially offset by a 763 million  reduction in cost of sales in our components segment primarily due to the following 

• continued manufacturing cost reductions of 1649 million and 

• lower inventory writeoff and asset impairment charges of 168 million partially offset by 

• higher costs of 679 million associated with increased solar modules sales volumes and 

• the downward change in estimate of 433 million on our future recycling costs recorded during 2013 

 57 

our costs of sales decreased by 696 million  or 3  and declined 08 percentage points as a percentage of net sales when comparing 2013  with 2012  the decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to a 448 million  reduction in cost of sales in our components segment and can largely be attributed to the following 2012  expenses that substantially did not occur in 2013  

 

in addition in 2013 the adjustment to lower our module and collection and recycling liability was 179 million higher than the prior year resulting in a reduction to cost of sales these decreases in our cost of sales were partially offset by a 456 million increase associated with growth in the volume of solar modules sold net of cost reductions in our manufacturing process and module efficiency improvements also our cost of sales was unfavorably impacted by lower utilization of our manufacturing capacity due to the temporary idling of production lines in perrysburg ohio and kulim malaysia causing a 236 million increase in cost of sales additionally cost of sales decreased by 248 million  in our systems segment primarily for bos components and other construction costs related to the relative number and size of various utilityscale solar power systems under construction and the progress on such construction between the periods as well as the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria were met 

gross profit 

gross profit  is affected by numerous factors including our module and system average selling prices our manufacturing costs bos costs project development costs the effective utilization of our production capacity and facilities and foreign exchange rates gross profit  is also affected by the mix of net sales generated by our components and systems businesses gross profit  for our systems business excludes the sales and cost of sales for solar modules used in our systems projects which we include in the gross profit of our components business as we move to a higher mix of thirdparty epc only contracts the gross profit on those contracts could be lower than gross profit on our self developed contracts 

the following table shows gross profit for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  



  

gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased by 17 percentage points during 2014  compared with 2013  primarily due to a mix of lower gross profit projects sold and under construction in 2014 and an adjustment for lower estimated recycling costs recorded in 2013 these decreases in gross profit were partially offset by favorable changes in estimated costs on systems projects accounted for under the percentageofcompletion method a lower volume of thirdparty module net sales which generally have margins less than systems business projects and higher capacity utilization of our manufacturing facilities 

gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased by 08 percentage points during 2013  compared with 2012  primarily due to the following i a 12 percentage point increase related to lower expense associated with voluntary remediation efforts for our 20082009 manufacturing excursion ii a 06 percentage point increase related to lower module collection and recycling liability iii a 07 percentage point increase due to lower accelerated depreciation expense for certain manufacturing equipment that have been replaced as part of our planned upgrade programs iv a 08 percentage point increase related to lower inventory writedown expense  and v a 05 percentage point increase due to lower costs associated with voluntary remediation efforts for workmanship issues affecting a limited number of solar modules manufactured between october 2008 and june 2009 these increases were partially offset by a 17 percentage point gross profit decrease in systems segment due to the mix of lower gross profit projects under construction between the periods and a 13 percentage point decrease due to lower gross profit for modules sold in our components segment primarily due to increased underutilization and lower average selling prices compared to module production costs between periods

research and development 

research and development  expense consists primarily of salaries and personnelrelated costs the cost of products materials and outside services used in our process and product research and development activities for both the components and systems businesses and depreciation and amortization expense associated with research and development specific facilities and intangible assets we acquire equipment for general use in our process and product development and record the depreciation of this equipment as research and development expense currently the substantial majority of our research and development expenses are attributable to our components segment we maintain a number of programs and activities to improve our technology and processes in order to enhance the performance and reduce the costs of our solar modules and pv solar power systems using our modules 

the following table shows research and development expense for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  



the overall increase in our research and development expense during 2014  compared with 2013  primarily resulted from additional costs related to the development of our nextgeneration cdte solar modules our joint collaboration agreement with ge to further advance our cdte solar technology and higher employee compensation costs during 2014  we continued the development of our solar modules with increased efficiencies at converting sunlight into electricity and increased the average conversion efficiency of our solar modules from 132 in 2013  to 140 in 2014  

the overall increase in our research and development expense during 2013  compared with 2012  primarily resulted from costs related to the improvement of our current generation modules integration of our module and bos technology into our pv power plants and the development of our next generation cdte and crystalline silicon solar cells the increase in research and development expense of 18 million  year over year was primarily related to our acquisition of cdte pv intellectual property assets and solar manufacturing processes from ge and an acquisition of crystalline silicon technology from tetrasun in connection with the ge acquisition we entered into a joint collaboration agreement with ge to collaborate on future technology development to further advance cdte solar technology research and development expense increased 58 million as a result of tetrasun acquisition primarily due to incremental increases in labor facility and depreciation expenses as well as additional costs related to testing of the tetrasun cell manufacturing technology and the development of crystalline silicon solar cells these increases were partially offset by a 32 million decrease in personnelrelated expenses resulting from lower employee compensation during 2013  we continued the development of our solar modules with increased efficiencies at converting sunlight into electricity and increased the average conversion efficiency of our solar modules from 126 in 2012  to 132 in 2013  

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative  expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated costs professional fees insurance costs travel expenses and other business development and selling expenses our components and systems businesses each has certain of its own dedicated administrative key functions such as accounting legal finance project finance human resources procurement and marketing costs for these functions are recorded and included within selling general and administrative costs of the respective segment our corporate key functions consist primarily of companywide corporate tax corporate treasury corporate accountingfinance corporate legal investor relations corporate communicationsgovernment relations and executive management functions these corporate functions and the assets supporting such functions benefit both the components and systems segments we allocate corporate costs to the components and systems segments as part of selling general and administrative costs based upon the estimated benefits provided to each segment from these corporate functions we determine the estimated benefits provided to each segment for these corporate costs based upon a combination of the estimated time spent by corporate employees supporting each segment and the average relative selling general and administrative costs incurred by each segment before such corporate allocations

the following table shows selling general and administrative expense for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  



our selling general and administrative expenses decreased by 164 million  or 6  and were 75  and 82  as a percentage of net sales when comparing 2014  with 2013  respectively the most significant items affecting our selling general and administrative costs during 2014  and 2013  are as follows 

 

our selling general and administrative expenses decreased by 107 million  or 4  and were 82  and 83  as a percentage of net sales when comparing 2013  with 2012  respectively the most significant items affecting our selling general and administrative costs during 2013  and 2012  are as follows 

 

  production startup   

production startup  expense consists primarily of salaries and personnelrelated costs and the cost of operating a production line before it has been qualified for full production including the cost of raw materials for solar modules run through the production line during the qualification phase it also includes all expenses related to the selection of a new site the related legal and regulatory costs and the costs to maintain our plant replication program to the extent we cannot capitalize these expenditures in general we expect production startup expense per production line to be higher when we build an entirely new manufacturing facility compared with the addition of new production lines at an existing manufacturing facility primarily due to the additional infrastructure investment required when building an entirely new facility production startup expense is attributable to our components segment 

the following table shows production startup expense for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  



 60 

during 2014  2013  and 2012  we incurred 51 million  28 million  and 78 million  respectively of production startup expenses in 2014  expenses primarily related to the startup of our tetrasun operations expenses for 2013  and 2012  are primarily for global manufacturing personnel dedicated plant expansion new equipment installation equipment upgrades and process improvements for both new and existing plants 

restructuring and asset impairments 

restructuring and asset impairment expense includes those expenses incurred related to material restructuring initiatives and include severance and employee termination costs that are directly related to our restructuring initiatives costs associated with contract terminations and other restructuring related costs these restructuring initiatives are intended to align the organization with current business conditions including expected sustainable market opportunities and to reduce costs 

the following table shows restructuring and asset impairments expense for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  



during 2013  and 2012  our restructuring and asset impairment charges included 52 million and 4691 million respectively related to restructuring initiatives announced in 2012 for charges associated with the closure of our german manufacturing plants and our decision not to move forward with our previously planned fourline manufacturing plant in vietnam additionally during 2013  we recorded asset impairment expense of 565 million  related to the agreement to sell our mesa arizona facility and an additional 252 million  impairment charge to adjust the carrying value of our plant in vietnam the effect of these asset impairments reduced the book value of both our mesa arizona facility and vietnam plant to fair value less costs to sell see note 4 “restructuring and asset impairments”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2014  included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

foreign currency loss net   

foreign currency loss net  consists of the net effect of gains and losses resulting from holding assets and liabilities and conducting transactions denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries’ functional currencies 

the following table shows foreign currency loss for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  



foreign currency loss increased during 2014  compared with 2013  and decreased during 2013  compared with 2012  primarily due to differences between our economic hedge positions and the underlying exposure along with changes in the associated exchange rates 

interest income 

interest income  is earned on our cash cash equivalents marketable securities and restricted cash and investments interest income also includes interest received from notes receivable and any interest collected for late customer payments 

the following table shows interest income for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  



interest income in 2014  was consistent with interest income in 2013  

 61 

interest income increased by 39 million  during 2013  compared with 2012  primarily due to interest earned on notes receivable from affiliates of 14 million combined with increased interest earned on higher average balances of our cash cash equivalents marketable securities and other notes receivable 

interest expense net   

interest expense is incurred on various debt financings we capitalize interest expense into our property plant and equipment or project assets when such costs qualify for interest capitalization reducing the amount of interest expense reported in any given period 

the following table shows interest expense net for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  



interest expense net of amounts capitalized in 2014  was consistent with interest expense net of amounts capitalized in 2013  

interest expense net of amounts capitalized decreased during 2013  compared with 2012  primarily as a result of 47 million in expense during 2012  associated with the repayment of a german credit facility agreement the remaining decrease in interest expense net is primarily related to lower average outstanding debt balances between the periods partially offset by a decrease in capitalized interest during the period 

other expense income net 

other expense income net  is primarily comprised of miscellaneous items amounts excluded from hedge effectiveness and realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities 

the following table shows other expense income net for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  



other expense income net in 2014  was consistent with other expense income net in 2013  

other expense income net increased during 2013  compared with 2012  as a result of a 45 million gain on the settlement of longterm debt recognized during 2012  in addition our financing fees including letter of credit and commitment fees based on the average daily unused commitments under our revolving credit facility increased by 04 million year over year 

income loss before taxes and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates   

the following table shows income loss before income taxes and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  



components segment loss before income taxes and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased by 1153 million  during 2014  compared with 2013  primarily as a result of lower restructuring and asset impairment charges related to the sale of our facility in mesa arizona and a decrease in selling general and administrative expense mainly driven by less depreciation and amortization expense for certain leasehold improvements and our mesa facility these reductions were partially offset by an adjustment for lower estimated recycling costs recorded during 2013 

 62 

systems segment income before income taxes and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased by 617 million  during 2014  compared with 2013  due to a mix of lower gross profit projects sold and under construction in 2014 and higher selling general and administrative expense attributable to increased headcount and higher development and consulting expenses from expanding into new markets these items were partially offset by favorable changes in estimated costs on systems projects accounted for under the percentageofcompletion method 

components segment loss before income taxes and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased by 4654 million  during 2013  compared with 2012  primarily due to higher net sales related to an increase in the volume of modules sold and lower restructuring expenses partially offset by higher asset impairment expenses in addition our components segment cost of sales decreased 4 during 2013  compared with 2012  primarily due to i a decrease in module collection and recycling liability ii a decrease in costs associated with voluntary remediation efforts for our 20082009 manufacturing excursion iii lower accelerated depreciation expense for certain manufacturing equipment that was replaced as part of our planned equipment upgrade programs iv lower inventory writedown expense primarily as a result of favorable fluctuations in inventory market pricing and v a decrease in costs associated with voluntary remediation efforts for workmanship issues affecting a limited number of solar modules manufactured between october 2008 and june 2009 these decreases were partially offset by higher cost of sales associated with growth in the volume of solar modules sold and underutilization charges 

systems segment loss before income taxes and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased 472 million  during 2013  compared with 2012  primarily due to the difference in project gross profit mix for which revenue was recognized during 2013  compared with 2012  

income tax expense   

income taxes are imposed on our taxable income by taxing authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate principally the united states germany and malaysia the statutory federal corporate income tax rate in the united states is 350  while the tax rates in germany and malaysia are approximately 302  and 250  respectively in malaysia we have been granted a longterm tax holiday scheduled to expire in 2027  pursuant to which substantially all of our income earned in malaysia is exempt from income tax 

the following table shows income tax expense for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  



income tax expense increased by 49 million  during 2014  compared with 2013  the increase in income tax expense was primarily attributable to an increase in pretax book income earned in higher tax jurisdictions in 2014 partially offset by a discrete tax benefit of 262 million due to the expiration of the statute of limitations for various uncertain tax positions see note 20 “income taxes”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2014  included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

income tax expense decreased by 314 million  during 2013  compared with 2012  primarily due to a reduction in valuation allowance recorded year over year offset by an increase in pretax book income see note 20 “income taxes”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2014  included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates net of tax   

equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates net of tax represents our proportionate share of the earnings and losses of unconsolidated affiliates with whom we have made equity method investments 

the following table shows equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates net of tax for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  

 63 



losses from unconsolidated affiliates increased during 2014  compared to 2013  primarily due to the impairment of certain of our equity method investments additionally during the period we increased strategic investments in certain thirdparties to develop construct or operate solar power projects and a small portion of the increase in 2014 related to our corresponding share of these entities’ operating losses these types of ventures are core to our business and longterm strategy related to providing solar solutions using our modules to sustainable geographic markets losses from unconsolidated affiliates in 2013  were consistent with 2012  

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2014  we believe that our cash cash equivalents marketable securities cash flows from operating activities including the contracted portion of our advancedstage project pipeline availability under our revolving credit facility considering minimum liquidity covenant requirements and access to the capital markets will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months we intend to continue to carefully manage credit and market risk 

cash generated from operations including the contracted portion of our advancedstage project pipeline is our primary source of operating liquidity and we believe that internally generated cash flows combined with our existing cash and cash equivalents marketable securities and availability under our revolving credit facility considering minimum liquidity covenant requirements are sufficient to support daytoday business operations we monitor our working capital to ensure we have adequate liquidity both domestically and internationally 

in june 2013 we sold 97 million shares of common stock for proceeds of 4282 million net of issuance costs in july 2013 we entered into an amendment to our revolving credit facility which extended 4500 million in availability through july 2018 additionally we have an active shelf registration statement filed with the sec for issuance of debt or equity securities if needed 

we intend to maintain appropriate debt levels based upon cash flow expectations the overall cost of capital and expected cash requirements for operations capital expenditures and discretionary strategic spending in the future we may also engage in one or more debt or equity financings potentially including project specific nonrecourse debt financings we believe that when necessary we will have adequate access to the capital markets although our ability to raise capital on terms commercially acceptable to us could be constrained if there is insufficient lender or investor interest due to industrywide or companyspecific concerns such financings could result in increased debt service expenses or dilution to our existing stockholders 

as of december 31 2014  we had 20 billion  in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities compared with 18 billion  as of december 31 2013  cash cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december 31 2014  increased primarily as the result of cash generated from operating activities partially offset by the repayment of longterm debt and project acquisitions as of december 31 2014  and 2013  14 billion  and 12 billion  respectively of our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in us dollar and euro denominated holdings we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed 

our expanding systems business requires liquidity and is expected to continue to have significant liquidity requirements in the future the net amount of our project assets deferred project costs billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings and payments and billings for deferred project costs which approximates our net capital investment in the development and construction of pv solar power systems as of december 31 2014  was 5838 million  solar power project development and construction cycles which span the time between the identification of a site location to the commercial operation of a pv solar power system vary substantially and can take many years to mature as a result of these long project cycles we may need to make significant upfront investments of resources in advance of the receipt of any cash from the sale of such pv solar power systems these amounts include payment of interconnection and other deposits some of which are nonrefundable posting of letters of credit and incurring engineering permitting legal and other expenses additionally we may choose to use and from time to time have used our working capital the availability under our revolving credit facility or enter into nonrecourse or limited recourse project financing to finance the construction of our systems projects if such projects cannot be sold before construction begins depending upon the size and number of projects that we are developing and selffinancing the construction of the systems business has and is 

 64 

expected in the future to require significant liquidity for example we may have to substantially complete the construction of a systems project before such project is sold delays in construction progress or in completing the sale of our systems projects which we are selffinancing may also impact our liquidity we have historically financed these upfront investments for project development and when necessary construction primarily using working capital 

we are partnering with local developers on project development in new markets around the world where we may take an equity stake in a project for a number of years we are also selfdeveloping projects in such markets where we may hold all or a significant portion of the equity in the projects for several years given the duration of these investments and the currency risk relative to the us dollar in some of these new markets we are exploring local financing alternatives should these financing alternatives be unavailable or too cost prohibitive our liquidity and exposure to significant currency risk could be adversely impacted 

additionally our evolving flexible business model allows us to retain ownership of certain of our systems projects for a period of time after they become operational up to the useful life of the pv solar power system if we determine it would be of economic and strategic benefit to do so if for example we cannot sell a systems project at economics that are attractive to us or potential customers are unwilling to assume the risks and rewards typical of pv solar power system ownership we may instead elect to own and operate such systems project generally until such time that we can sell a project on economically attractive terms as with traditional electricity generating assets the selling price of a solar power plant could be higher postcompletion to reflect the elimination of construction and performance risk and other uncertainties the decision to own and operate a pv solar power system impacts liquidity depending upon the size and cost of the project we may elect to enter into temporary or longterm nonrecourse project financing to reduce the impact on our liquidity and working capital we are considering entering into yieldco or similar arrangements with respect to ownership interests in certain of our projects which could cause the economics of such arrangements to be recognized over the project’s life such as the potential joint venture yieldco transaction described under “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – certain trends and uncertainties – yieldco” we define yieldco as an entity that owns cashgenerating infrastructure assets including solar power plants and similar to reits or mlps spins out ownership to the public markets 

the following considerations have impacted or are expected to impact our liquidity in 2015 and beyond 

  

 

 

  65 

term demand for thirdparty module sales as of december 31 2014  approximately 191 million  or 43  of our solar module inventory was either onsite or intransit to our systems projects all bos parts are for our systems business projects 

 

 

 

 

the unprecedented disruption in the credit markets that began in 2008 had a significant adverse impact on a number of financial institutions global sovereign debt problems and its impact on the balance sheets and lending practices of global banks in particular could negatively impact our access to and cost of capital and therefore could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and competitive position it could also similarly affect our customers and therefore limit the demand for our systems projects or solar modules as of december 31 2014  our liquidity and marketable securities and restricted investments have not been materially adversely impacted by the current credit environment and we believe that they will not be materially adversely impacted in the near future we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity and the credit markets however we cannot predict with any certainty the impact to us of any further disruption in the current credit environment 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes the key cash flow metrics for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  in thousands 



 66 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 6810 million  during 2014  8561 million  during 2013  and 7622 million  during 2012 the decrease in operating cash flows during 2014  was primarily due to lower cash received from customers in 2014 as compared to 2013 in addition during 2014 our operating cash flows were unfavorably impacted by higher income taxes paid of 170 million  compared to income taxes refunds net of taxes paid of 16 million  in 2013 and 215 million  in 2012 the excess tax benefit related to share based compensation arrangements was 312 million  for 2014 as compared to 351 million  for 2013 and 274 million  for 2012 the remaining decrease in cash provided by operating activities was the result of net differences in interest received interest paid and other operating activities in 2014 compared to 2013 and 2012 changes in net assets and liabilities decreased our cash flow from operations by 92 million  in 2014 versus an increase to our cash flow from operations of 1865 million  in 2013 the decrease in net assets and liabilities during 2014 of 1957 million  primarily resulted from the following

cash used in investing activities was 5119 million  during 2014  compared with 5371 million  during 2013  and 3837 million  during 2012 cash used in investing activities during 2014 included capital expenditures of 2575 million  compared to 2826 million  and 3792 million  in 2013 and 2012 respectively the decrease can generally be attributed to increased focus on capital spending management and the impact of timing differences associated with cash payments for property plant and equipment cash proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment were 15 million  during 2014 1164 million  during 2013 primarily as a result of the mesa sales agreement and 51 million  during 2012 during 2014 we provided net additional funding to affiliates of 232 million  during 2014 and 2013 we increased our net investments in marketable securities by 775 million  and 3410 million  respectively compared to a decrease of our net investments totaling 795 million  during 2012 we had an outflow for restricted cash of 1241 million  during 2014 compared to inflows of 52 million  and 162 million  in 2013 and 2012 respectively during 2014 2013 and 2012 we made cash investments in unconsolidated entities of 250 million  179 million  and 50 million  respectively acquisitions net of cash acquired resulted in payments of 43 million  in 2014 compared to 307 million  in 2013 and 24 million  in 2012 payment for acquisitions in 2014 related primarily to our acquisition of skytron a europeanbased om company payments for acquisitions in 2013 related primarily to acquisitions of solar chile sa a chileanbased 

 67 

solar project development company and tetrasun inc a development stage company with high efficiency crystalline silicon technology during 2012 we made a second payment of 24 million under the terms of the acquisition agreement related to our acquisition of ray tracker inc “ray tracker” a tracking technology and pv bos company we acquired in 2011 in an allcash transaction

cash provided by financing activities was 74 million  during 2014 and 1012 million  during 2013 and cash used in financing activities was 891 million  during 2012 cash provided by financing activities during 2014 resulted primarily from proceeds of 656 million  from borrowings under longterm debt and excess tax benefit from sharebased compensation arrangements of 312 million  partially offset by the repayment of longterm debt of 601 million  and contingent consideration and other financing activities payments of 293 million  

cash provided by financing activities during 2013 resulted primarily from the net cash proceeds from our june 2013 equity offering of 4282 million  and excess tax benefit from sharebased compensation arrangements of 351 million  partially offset by repayment of longterm debt and economic development funding of 733 million  and net repayment of borrowings under our revolving credit facility of 2700 million

contractual obligations 

the following table presents our contractual obligations as of december 31 2014  in thousands which consists of legal commitments requiring us to make fixed or determinable cash payments we purchase raw materials for inventory or balance of systems parts services and manufacturing equipment from a variety of vendors we also enter into contracts for the construction of solar power projects during the normal course of business in order to manage manufacturing and construction lead times and help assure adequate supply we enter into agreements with suppliers that either allow us to procure goods and services when we choose or that establish purchase requirements each year or over the term of the agreement 



 

 

 

  68 

a contingent liability when we determine that such liability is both probable and reasonably estimable see note 16 “commitments and contingencies”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2014  included in this annual report on form 10k for further information about our contingent consideration 

 

in addition to the amounts shown in the table above we have recorded 1260 million  of unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with asc 740 income taxes  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 

debt and credit sources 

as of december 31 2014  we had 2240 million  in outstanding longterm debt excluding amounts related to capital leases and unamortized discount and 2025 million  in outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees our longterm debt consisted of the following at december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  in thousands 



at december 31 2014  future principal payments on our longterm debt excluding amounts related to capital leases and unamortized discounts were due as follows in thousands 



revolving credit facility   

our credit agreement with several financial institutions as lenders jp morgan securities llc and bank of america securities llc as jointlead arrangers and bookrunners and jp morgan chase bank na as administrative agent “revolving credit facility” provides us with a senior secured credit facility with an aggregate available amount of 6000 million  with the right to request an increase up to 7500 million  subject to certain conditions borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at i libor adjusted for eurocurrency reserve requirements plus a margin of 225 or ii a base rate as defined in the credit agreement plus a margin of 125 depending on the type of borrowing requested by us these margins are subject to adjustments depending on our consolidated leverage ratio as of december 31 2014 and 2013 we had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility respectively we had 2025 million  and 1586 million  of letters of credit using availability under our revolving credit facility leaving 3975 million  and 4414 million  of availability at december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively we believe that when necessary we will have adequate access to capital markets but there may be circumstances in the future related to macroeconomic conditions or factors specific to us that could limit or increase the cost of capital from such markets 

 69 

in addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the revolving credit facility  we are required to pay a commitment fee currently at the rate of 0375  per annum based on the average daily unused commitments under the facility the commitment fee may also be adjusted due to changes in our consolidated leverage ratio we also pay a letter of credit fee equal to the applicable margin for eurocurrency revolving loans on the face amount of each letter of credit and a fronting fee of 0125  

on july 15 2013 we entered into the fourth amendment to the amended and restated revolving credit facility the “amendment” the amendment provided for among other things the division of the revolving credit facility into tranche a commitments in an aggregate amount equal to 4500 million  and tranche b commitments in an aggregate amount equal to 1500 million  and the extension of the maturity date of the tranche a loans until july 15 2018 the maturity date of the tranche b loans and commitment is october 15 2015 and is unchanged the amendment also contained certain covenant changes 

in connection with the amendment we entered into an amended and restated guarantee and collateral agreement loans and letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility are jointly and severally unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by first solar inc first solar electric llc first solar electric california inc and first solar development llc and are secured by security interests in substantially all of the grantors’ tangible and intangible assets other than certain excluded assets 

the revolving credit facility  contains financial covenants including a leverage ratio covenant a minimum ebitda covenant and a minimum liquidity covenant we are also subject to customary nonfinancial covenants we were in compliance with these covenants as of december 31 2014  and expect to remain in compliance with these covenants for at least the next twelve months 

see note 15 “debt”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2014  included in this annual report on form 10k for further information about our longterm debt facilities 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet debt or similar obligations other than financial assurance instruments and operating leases that are not classified as debt we do not guarantee any thirdparty debt see note 15 “commitments and contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2014  included in this annual report on form 10k for further information about our financial assurance instruments 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 3 “recent accounting pronouncements”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2014  included in this annual report on form 10k for a summary of recent accounting pronouncements 

critical accounting estimates 

in preparing our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” we make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts of reported assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities in our financial statements and the related notes thereto some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in the selection of the appropriate assumptions for making these estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty we base our judgments and estimates on our historical experience our forecasts and other available information as appropriate our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2014  included in this annual report on form 10k 

our critical accounting estimates which require the most significant management estimates and judgment in determining amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k are as follows 

revenue recognition — systems business  we recognize revenue for arrangements entered into by our systems business generally using two revenue recognition models following the guidance in asc 605 accounting for longterm construction contracts or for arrangements which include land or land rights asc 360 accounting for sales of real estate 

for systems business sales arrangements that do not include land or land rights and thus are accounted for under asc 605 we use the percentageofcompletion method as described further below using actual costs incurred over total estimated costs to develop and construct a project including module costs as our standard accounting policy unless we cannot make reasonably dependable estimates of the costs to complete the contract in which case we would use the completed contract method 

 70 

for systems business sales arrangements that are accounted for under asc 360 where we convey control of land or land rights we record the sale as revenue using one of the following revenue recognition methods based upon evaluation of the substance and form of the terms and conditions of such real estate sales arrangements 

 

 

 

for any systems business sales arrangements containing multiple deliverables including our solar modules not required to be accounted for under asc 360 real estate or asc 605 longterm construction contracts we analyze each activity within the sales arrangement to ensure that we adhere to the separation guidelines of asc 605 for multipleelement arrangements we allocate revenue for any transactions involving multiple elements to each unit of accounting based on its relative selling price and recognize revenue for each unit of accounting when all revenue recognition criteria for a unit of accounting have been met 

revenue recognition — percentageofcompletion in applying the percentageofcompletion method we use the actual costs incurred relative to the estimated costs to complete including module costs in order to estimate the progress towards completion to determine the amount of revenue and profit to recognize incurred costs include all installed direct materials installed solar modules labor subcontractor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance such as indirect labor supplies and tools we recognize direct material and solar module costs as incurred costs when the direct materials and solar modules have been installed in the project when contracts specify that title to direct materials and solar modules transfers to the customer before installation has been performed we will not recognize revenue or the associated costs until those materials are installed and have met all other revenue recognition requirements we consider direct materials and solar modules to be installed when they are permanently placed or affixed to the solar power system as required by engineering designs solar modules manufactured by us that will be used in our solar power systems which we still hold title to remain within inventory until such modules are installed in a solar power system 

the percentageofcompletion method of revenue recognition requires us to make estimates of contract revenues and costs to complete our projects in making such estimates management judgments are required to evaluate significant assumptions including the cost of materials and labor expected labor productivity the impact of potential variances in schedule completion the amount of net contract revenues and the impact of any penalties claims change orders or performance incentives 

if estimated total costs on any contract are greater than the contract revenues we recognize the entire estimated loss in the period the loss becomes known the cumulative effect of the revisions to estimates related to contract revenues and costs to complete contracts including penalties incentive awards claims change orders anticipated losses and others are recorded in the period in which the revisions to estimates are identified and the loss can be reasonably estimated the effect of the changes on future periods are recognized as if the revised estimates had been used since revenue was initially recognized under the contract such revisions could occur in any reporting period and the effects may be material depending on the size of the contracts or the changes in estimates

accrued solar module collection and recycling liability at the time of sale we recognize an expense for the estimated cost of our future obligation for collecting and recycling solar modules sold that are covered by our prefunded collection and recycling program we estimate the cost of our collection and recycling obligations based on the present value of the expected probability weighted future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules which includes estimates for the cost of packaging the solar modules for transport the cost of freight from the solar module installation sites to a recycling center the material labor capital costs and scale of recycling centers and an estimated thirdparty profit margin and return on risk for collection and recycling services we base this estimate on i our experience collecting and recycling our solar modules and on our expectations about future developments in recycling technologies and processes ii economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled and iii the expected timing of when our solar modules will be returned for recycling in the periods between the time of our sales and the settlement of our collection and recycling obligations we accrete the carrying amount of the associated liability by applying the discount rate used for its initial measurement 

during the year ended december 31 2014  we did not make any significant changes to our recycling technology roadmap cost estimates or inflation assumptions based on our annual cost study as part of this study we obtained a high volume of operational cost data that confirmed our currently estimated future collection and recycling costs remained appropriate we will continue to evaluate our estimates as technology and cost assumptions change in the future at december 31 2014  our estimated liability for collecting and recycling solar modules covered by our collection and recycling program was 2463 million  a 1 increase in the annualized inflation rate used in our estimated future collection and recycling cost per module would increase our liability by 606 million  and a 1 decrease in that inflation rate would decrease our liability by 498 million  

product warranties and accrued expense in excess of product warranties  we provide a limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for 10 years following delivery to the owners of our solar modules we also typically warrant to the owners of our solar modules that modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 90  of their labeled power output rating during the first 10 years following their installation and at least 80  of their labeled power output rating during the following 15 years in resolving claims under both the defects and power output warranties we have the option of either repairing or replacing the covered solar modules or under the power output warranty providing additional solar modules to remedy the power shortfall we also have the option to make a payment for the then current market price of solar modules to resolve claims our warranties are automatically transferred from the original purchasers of our solar modules to subsequent purchasers upon resale in 2013 we announced to our customers the availability of a new linear power output warranty for modules shipping beginning in the second quarter of 2014 

as an alternative to our module power output warranty we have offered a system level module performance warranty for a limited number of our recent system sales this system level module performance warranty is designed for utility scale systems and provides 25year plantlevel energy degradation protection the system level module performance warranty is typically calculated as a percentage of a system’s expected energy production adjusted for certain actual site conditions including weather with the warranted level of performance declining each year in a linear fashion but never falling below 80 during the term of the warranty in resolving claims under the system level module performance warranty to restore the system to warranted performance levels we first must validate that the root cause is due to module performance for qualifying claims we typically have the option to repair or replace modules provide supplemental modules or make a cash payment consistent with our module power output warranty when we elect to satisfy a valid warranty claim by providing replacement or supplemental modules under the system level module performance warranty we do not have any obligation to pay for the labor to remove or install modules 

in addition to our solar module warranty described above for solar power plants built by our systems business we typically provide a limited warranty on the balance of the system against defects in engineering design installation and workmanship for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a phase or the entire solar power plant in resolving claims under the engineering design installation and workmanship warranties we have the option of remedying the defect through repair or replacement 

when we recognize revenue for module or systems project sales we accrue a liability for the estimated future costs of meeting our limited warranty obligations we make and revise these estimates based primarily on the number of our solar modules under warranty installed at customer locations our historical experience with warranty claims our monitoring of field installation sites our internal testing of and the expected future performance of our solar modules and bos components and our estimated permodule replacement cost such estimates have changed and may in the future change based primarily upon historical experience including additional information received from the evaluation of warranty claims and the complete processing of such claims 

 72 

we also make an estimate for the costs of any voluntary remediation programs including our 20082009 manufacturing excursion our estimate for remediation costs for our 20082009 manufacturing excursion is based on evaluation and consideration of currently available information including the estimated number of affected modules in the field historical experience related to our remediation efforts customerprovided data related to potentially affected systems the estimated costs of performing any remediation services and the postsale expenses covered under our remediation program from time to time we have taken remediation actions in respect of affected modules beyond our limited warranty and we may elect to do so in the future in such cases we would incur additional expenses that are beyond our limited warranty if we commit to any such remediation actions beyond our limited warranty developing our estimates for such remediation actions may require significant management judgment 

at december 31 2014  our accrued liabilities for product warranties and accrued expense in excess of product warranties were 2231 million  and 309 million  respectively we have historically estimated our product warranty liability for power output and defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions to have an estimated warranty return rate of approximately 3  of modules covered under warranty a 1  change in the estimated warranty return rate would change our estimated product warranty liability by approximately 60 million  

accounting for income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the united states and its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining our provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit we regularly assess the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and subsequent years’ examinations and we record tax liabilities as appropriate 

we establish liabilities for potential additional taxes that may arise out of tax audits once established we adjust the liabilities when additional information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring an adjustment significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the actual cost of a legal claim tax assessment regulatory fine or penalty may ultimately be materially different from our recorded liabilities if any 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements we calculate our income tax expense based on our interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business this requires us to estimate our current tax obligations and the realizability of uncertain tax positions and to assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities the net current amount of which we show as a component of current assets or current liabilities and the net noncurrent amount of which we show as other assets or other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 

we must also assess the likelihood that each of our deferred tax assets will be realized to the extent we believe that realization of any of our deferred tax assets is not more likely than not we establish a valuation allowance when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a reporting period we generally record a corresponding tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations conversely to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed which generally reduces our overall income tax expense 

we also consider the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and determine whether such amounts are indefinitely reinvested outside the united states we have concluded that except for the earnings of our canadian subsidiary and with respect to previously taxed income all such accumulated earnings are currently indefinitely reinvested accordingly no additional taxes have been accrued that might be incurred if such amounts were repatriated to the united states if our intention to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries changes additional taxes may be required to be accrued see note 20 “income taxes”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2014  included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

we continually explore initiatives to better align our tax and legal entity structure with the footprint of our nonus operations and recognize the tax impact of these initiatives including changes in the assessment of uncertain tax positions indefinite reinvestment exception assertions and the realizability of deferred tax assets in the period when management believes all necessary internal and external approvals associated with such initiatives have been obtained or when the initiatives are materially complete it is possible that the completion of one or more of these initiatives may occur within the next 12 months

longlived asset impairment  we are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of longlived assets including “property plant and equipment” “project assets” and “pv solar power systems” when an indicator of impairment has been identified we review our longlived assets each reporting period to assess whether impairment indicators are present we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event indicating potential impairment has occurred 

for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss a longlived asset is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities we must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 

for longlived assets when impairment indicators are present we compare undiscounted future cash flows including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value to the asset group’s carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable this assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the assets to be held and used assessments also consider changes in asset group utilization including the temporary idling of capacity and the expected timing of placing this capacity back into production 

for an asset group that fails the test of recoverability described above the estimated fair value of longlived assets may be determined using an “income approach” “market approach” “cost approach” or a combination of one or more of these approaches as appropriate for the particular asset group being reviewed all of these approaches start with the forecast of expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of longlived assets we also utilize thirdparty valuations and information available regarding the current market for similar assets if there is an impairment a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the asset group’s fair value and carrying value prior to impairment this may require judgment in estimating future cash flows relevant discount rates and residual values applied in the income approach used in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used 

goodwill  goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the estimated fair value assigned to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed we do not amortize goodwill but instead are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter we perform impairment tests between scheduled annual tests if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill is less than its carrying value 

  

we may first make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test the qualitative impairment test considers various factors including macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors a sustained share price or market capitalization decrease and any reporting unit specific events if it is determined through the qualitative assessment that a reporting unit’s fair value is more likely than not greater than its carrying value the twostep impairment test is not required if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is not greater than its carrying value we must perform the twostep impairment test we may also elect to proceed directly to the twostep impairment test without considering such qualitative factors 

the first step in a twostep impairment test is the comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill our reporting units consist of our fully integrated systems business cadmium telluride module manufacturing business and our crystalline silicon module manufacturing business from our tetrasun acquisition in 2013 in accordance with the authoritative guidance over fair value measurements we define the fair value of a reporting unit as the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date we primarily use the income approach methodology of valuation which includes the discounted cash flow method to estimate the fair values of our reporting units 

significant management judgment is required when estimating the fair value of our reporting units including the forecasting of future operating results and the selection of discount and expected future growth rates that we use in discounting cash flows if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is not impaired and no further analysis is required 

if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value in the first step then we are required to perform the second step of the impairment test in this step we assign the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in step one to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if a market participant just acquired the reporting unit in a business combination the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in the first step of the impairment test over the total amount assigned to the assets and liabilities in the second step of the impairment test represents the implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference if there is no such excess then all goodwill for a reporting unit is considered impaired

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our primary foreign currency exposures are cash flow exposure transaction exposure and earnings translation exposure 

cash flow exposure  we expect our subsidiaries to have material future cash flows including net sales and expenses that will be denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries’ functional currencies our primary cash flow exposures are cash received from customers and cash paid to suppliers and associates changes in the exchange rates between our subsidiaries’ functional currencies and the other currencies in which they transact will cause fluctuations in the cash flows we expect to receive or pay when these cash flows are realized or settled accordingly we enter into foreign exchange forward and crosscurrency swap contracts to hedge the value of a portion of these forecasted cash flows these foreign exchange forward and crosscurrency swap contracts qualified for and were designated as cash flow hedges we initially report the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss in “accumulated other comprehensive income loss” and subsequently reclassify amounts into earnings when the underlying hedged transaction is settled 

our operations in malaysia pay a portion of their operating expenses such as associate wages and utilities in malaysian ringgit exposing us to foreign currency exchange risk for those malaysian ringgit expenses as we expand into new markets worldwide particularly emerging markets our total foreign currency exchange risk in terms of both size and exchange rate volatility and the number of foreign currencies we are exposed to could increase significantly 

for additional details on our derivative hedging instruments and activities refer to note 10 “derivative financial instruments”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2014  included in this annual report on form 10k 

our international operations accounted for 10  14  and 20  of our net sales during the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively of which 25  38  and 18  of these international sales respectively were denominated in euros as a result we have exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to our net sales fluctuations in exchange rates particularly in the us dollar to euro and us dollar to malaysian ringgit affect our gross profit and could result in foreign exchange and operating losses in the past most of our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk has related to currency gains and losses between the time we sign and settle our sales contracts denominated in euros for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  a 10 change in the euro exchange rates would have impacted our net euro sales by 88 million  183 million  and 116 million  respectively excluding the effect of our hedging activities 

transaction exposure many components of our business have assets and liabilities primarily receivables investments accounts payable debt and accrued liabilities and solar module collection and recycling liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the subsidiary’s functional currency changes in the exchange rates between our subsidiaries’ functional currencies and the other currencies in which these assets and liabilities are denominated can create fluctuations in our reported consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other derivative instruments to economically hedge assets and liabilities against the shortterm effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations the gains and losses on these derivative instruments will offset all or part of the transaction gains and losses that we recognize in earnings on the related foreign currency assets and liabilities these contracts typically have maturities of less than three months  

for additional details on our economic hedging instruments and activities refer to note 10 “derivative financial instruments”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2014  included in this annual report on form 10k 

if the us dollar would have weakened by 10 against the euro british pound malaysian ringgit chinese yuan and chilean peso the impact on our income before income taxes during the year ended december 31 2014  would have been 09 million  favorable 

earnings translation exposure  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to translate the financial statements of our subsidiaries that do not have a us dollar functional currency we may decide to purchase forward exchange contracts or other instruments to offset this impact from currency fluctuations these contracts would be markedtomarket on a monthly basis and any unrealized gain or loss would be recorded in earnings we do not hedge translation exposure at this time but may do so in the future 

 75 

in the past currency exchange rate fluctuations have had an impact on our business and results of operations for example currency exchange rate fluctuations impacted our cash flows by 195 million  unfavorable 36 million  favorable and 63 million  favorable in the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively although we cannot predict the impact of future currency exchange rate fluctuations on our business or results of operations we believe that we will continue to have risk associated with currency exchange rate fluctuations in the future we will continue to evaluate actions we can take to use derivative instruments to help mitigate this risk 

interest rate risk 

our primary interest rate risks relate to our outstanding variable rate debt our solar power system sales prices from the effect of interest rates on our customer’s financing of such solar power systems and our investments in marketable securities and restricted investments 

variable rate debt exposure we are exposed to interest rate risk because our revolving credit facility malaysian ringgit facility agreement malaysian euro facility agreement and the floating rate portion of our malaysian facility agreement have variable interest rates exposing us to variability in interest expense and cash flows we use interest rate and crosscurrency swap contracts to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated with a portion of our variable rate debt instruments we have interest rate swap contracts in place to mitigate the interest rate risk for the floating rate portion of our malaysian facility agreement we also have a crosscurrency swap contract in place to mitigate the interest rate risk of our malaysian ringgit facility agreement 

for additional details on our derivative hedging instruments and activities refer to note 10 “derivative financial instruments”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2014  included in this annual report on form 10k 

an increase in the euro interbank offered rate “euribor” would impact our cost of borrowing under our malaysian euro facility agreement  and an increase in the prime rate and london interbank offered rate “libor” would impact our cost of borrowing under our revolving credit facility  if euribor changes by 100 basis points our interest cost for the year ended december 31 2014  would have changed by 04 million  

effect of interest rates on our customer’s financing of solar power systems  we are exposed to interest rate risk because many of our systems business customers depend on debt and equity financing to purchase a solar power system from us although the useful life of a solar power system is considered to be approximately 25 years owners of our solar power systems must pay the entire cost of the solar power system by the time such system is completed as a result many of our customers rely on debt financing to fund their upfront capital expenditures an increase in interest rates available to finance such purchases could make it difficult for our customers to secure the financing and underlying interest rate necessary to purchase a system this could lower demand or the price we can charge for our solar power systems and reduce our net sales and gross profit in addition we believe that a significant percentage of our customers purchase solar power systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt an increase in interest rates could lower an investor’s return on investment in a system or make alternative investments more attractive relative to solar power systems which in each case could cause these endusers to seek alternative investments that promise higher returns 

investments in marketable securities and related investment exposure  we invest in various debt securities which exposes us to interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and provide liquidity while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the market value of the investment to fluctuate for example if we hold a security that was issued with an interest rate fixed at the thenprevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises the market value of our investment may decline 

to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investments in marketable securities and restricted investments we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investments assuming a 100 basis point shift in interest rates during 2014  our marketable securities earned a pretax yield of less than 1  and had a weighted average maturity of 10 months  as of december 31 2014  based on our investment positions as of december 31 2014  a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in a 37 million  change in the market value of our investment portfolio as of december 31 2013  a similar 100 basis point change in interest rates would have resulted in a 38 million  change in the market value of our investment portfolio as of december 31 2014  our marketable securities were comprised of foreign debt time deposits us debt and us government obligations  

 76 

during december 31 2014  our restricted investments earned a pretax yield of 45  and had a weighted average maturity of approximately 20  years as of december 31 2014  based on our investment positions as of december 31 2014  a hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in a 744 million  change in the market value of our restricted investment portfolio as of december 31 2013  a similar 100 basis point change in interest rates would have resulted in a 590 million  change in the market value of our restricted investment portfolio as of december 31 2014  all of our restricted investments were in foreign and us government obligations 

commodity and component risk 

we are exposed to price risks for the raw materials components and energy costs used in the manufacture and transportation of our solar modules and bos parts used in solar power systems also some of our raw materials and components are sourced from a limited number of suppliers or a single supplier we endeavor to qualify multiple suppliers using a robust qualification process in some cases we also enter into longterm supply contracts for raw materials and components as a result we remain exposed to price changes in the raw materials and components used in our solar modules in addition a failure by a key supplier could disrupt our supply chain which could result in higher prices andor a disruption in our manufacturing or construction processes we may be unable to pass along changes in the cost of the raw materials and components for our products and systems to our customers and may be in default of our delivery obligations if we experience a manufacturing or construction disruption 

credit risk 

we have certain financial and derivative instruments that subject us to credit risk these consist primarily of cash cash equivalents marketable securities restricted investments trade accounts receivable interest rate swap contracts crosscurrency swap contracts and foreign exchange forward contracts we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial and derivative instruments we place cash cash equivalents marketable securities restricted investments interest rate swap contracts crosscurrency contracts and foreign exchange forward contracts with various highquality financial institutions and limit the amount of credit risk from any one counterparty we continuously evaluate the credit standing of our counterparty financial institutions 

in addition we have certain investments in debt securities related to countries in the eurozone these investments are for debt securities of countries with a lower likelihood of experiencing significant economic fiscal andor political strains resulting in a default or severe decreases in fair value however such risk cannot be entirely eliminated and is reflected in the current fair value of the investments as of december 31 2014  




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and   financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

a evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain “disclosure controls and procedures” as such term is defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that disclosure controls and procedures no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met additionally in designing disclosure controls and procedures our management was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures the design of any disclosure control and procedure also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 

based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of that date 

b management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate “internal control over financial reporting” as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2014  based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework 2013  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 

based on the results of our evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2014  

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2014  has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in its report which appears herein 

c changes in internal control over financial reporting 

we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of our “internal control over financial reporting” as defined in exchange act rule 13a15f and rule 15d15f to determine whether any changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the year ended december 31 2014  that materially affected or are reasonably likely to material affect our internal control over financial reporting 

based on that evaluation there have been no such changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2014  that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

 79 

d inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud control systems no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control systems’ objectives are being met further the design of any control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of all controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within our company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of error or mistake control systems can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

 item 1 business 

company overview 

we are a global provider of solar energy solutions focused on providing power solutions across key market segments we design manufacture and sell photovoltaic “pv” solar modules with an advanced thinfilm semiconductor technology and we develop design construct and sell pv solar power solutions that primarily use the solar modules we manufacture we are also developing crystalline silicon solar modules with proprietary highpower density monocrystalline technology and we provide singleaxis mounting systems with proprietary tracking capabilities additionally we provide operations and maintenance “om” services to plant owners that use solar modules manufactured by us or by other thirdparty manufacturers we have substantial ongoing research and development efforts focused on module and systems level innovations we are the world’s largest thinfilm pv solar module manufacturer and one of the world’s largest pv solar module manufacturers our mission is to create enduring value by enabling a world powered by clean affordable solar energy 

in addressing overall global demand for pv solar electricity we have developed a differentiated fully integrated systems business that can provide competitively priced utilityscale pv solutions for system owners and low cost solar electricity to endusers our fully integrated systems business has enabled us to drive cost reduction across the value chain identify and break constraints to sustainable markets and deliver compelling solutions to our customers and endusers with our fully integrated systems business we believe we are in a position to expand our business in economically sustainable markets in which support programs are minimal which are developing in areas that have a combination of abundant solar resources relatively high current electricity costs and sizable electricity demand we are committed to continually lowering the cost of solar electricity and in the longterm we plan to compete on an economic basis with conventional fossilfuelbased peaking power generation 

in furtherance of our goal of delivering affordable solar electricity we are continually focused on reducing pv solar power system costs in five primary areas module manufacturing balance of system “bos” costs consisting of the costs of the components of a solar power system other than the solar modules that we manufacture such as inverters mounting hardware trackers grid interconnection equipment wiring and other devices and installation labor costs project development costs the cost of capital and the operating expenses of a pv solar system first with respect to our module manufacturing costs our advanced technology has allowed us to reduce our average module manufacturing costs to among the lowest in the world for modules produced on a commercial scale based on publicly available information in 2013 our total average manufacturing cost was 063 per watt which is competitive on a comparable basis with or is lower than those of traditional crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers based on publicly available information by continuing to improve conversion efficiency increasing production line throughput and lowering raw material costs we believe that we can further reduce our manufacturing costs per watt and maintain cost competitiveness with traditional crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers second with respect to our planned bos cost reduction roadmap we have aggressive programs which target key improvements in components and system design which when combined with continued improvements in solar module conversion efficiency volume procurement around standardized hardware platforms use of innovative installation techniques and know how and accelerated installation times are expected to result in substantial reductions in our bos costs resulting in a lower system levelized cost of energy third with respect to our project development costs we seek optimal site locations in an effort to maximize solar resource and minimize transmission and permitting costs and to accelerate lead times to electricity generation fourth with respect to the cost of capital by continuing to demonstrate the financial viability and operational performance of our utilityscale pv solar power systems and increasing our system operating experience we believe we can continue to lower the cost of capital associated with our systems thereby further enhancing the economic viability of our projects and lowering the cost of electricity generated by pv solar power systems that incorporate our modules and technology the remaining primary pv solar power system cost relates to the actual operating expenses of a system which includes the operations and maintenance costs of the plant we believe that our om services are an important aspect to the overall future reduction expected in the levelized cost of electricity “lcoe” of a pv solar power system through seamless grid integration increased reliability and maximization of availability of the systems we operate and maintain for our customers 

in addition to enabling the pv system cost reductions described above we believe that combining our vertical integration across the value chain enables us to be more competitive accelerate the adoption of our technology in solar power systems and identify and remove constraints to the successful migration to sustainable solar markets around the world our vertically integrated capabilities enable us to maximize value and mitigate risk for our customers and offer valuable benefits such as grid integration and stabilization thereby positioning us to deliver meaningful pv energy solutions to varied energy problems worldwide we seek to offer leadership across the entire solar value chain resulting in more reliable and cost effective pv energy solutions for our customers and furthering our mission to create enduring value by enabling a world powered by clean affordable solar electricity

market overview 

solar energy is a growing form of renewable energy with numerous economic as well as environmental benefits that make it an attractive complement to andor substitute for traditional forms of electricity generation in recent years the price of pv systems and accordingly the cost of producing electricity from pv solar has dropped to levels that are in some markets and applications close to or even below the retail price of electricity the rapid price decline that pv experienced in the last few years opens new possibilities to develop pv systems in some locations with limited or no financial incentives the fact that a pv solar system requires no fuel provides a unique and valuable hedging benefit to owners of pv systems relative to traditional electricity generation assets once installed solar systems can function for 25 or more years with relatively less maintenance or oversight compared to traditional forms of electricity generation in addition to pv solar’s economic benefits pv solar has several environmental benefits for example pv systems do not generate any greenhouse gas or other emissions and use no or minimal amounts of water compared to traditional forms of electricity generation solar markets worldwide continue to develop aided by the above factors as well as demand elasticity resulting from declining industry average selling prices both at the module and system level which make solar power more affordable to new markets and we have continued to develop our localized presence and expertise in these markets 

  

in 2013 according to industry analyst ihs industry module average selling prices began to show signs of stabilization in several markets after a long period of significant decline across multiple markets lower industry module pricing while currently challenging for solar manufacturers particularly manufacturers with high cost structures is expected to continue to contribute to global market diversification and volume elasticity over time declining average selling prices are consistent with the erosion of one of the primary historical constraints to widespread solar market penetration its affordability global demand is becoming more diffused as developing markets continue to grow this has been reflected in changing business practices as more solar companies seek to regionally diversify their downstream strategy ihs estimates that pv installations worldwide in 2013 reached approximately 35 gigawatts “gw” and will grow by 17 in 2014 to reach approximately 41 gw 

in the united states the solar market continues to advance as solar electricity narrows the cost gap with traditional electricity sources together with a backdrop of policy support as described further under “support programs” below installed solar power capacity in the us grew by 43 in 2013 with the country adding 29 gw of largescale solar energy to the grid according to the december 2013 energy infrastructure update report from the federal energy regulatory commission’s “ferc” office of energy projects projections for the sustainable growth of solar energy use in the united states are positive mostly due to a large pipeline of utilityscale installations some of which are due to be completed in 2014 and 2015 

the solar industry continues to be characterized by intense pricing competition both at the module and system level with 

many solar companies generating operating losses or little to no operating income we believe the solar industry will continue to experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity exceeds global demand and that such periods will put pressure on pricing in light of such market realities we continue to execute our long term strategic plan described below under which we are focusing on our competitive strengths a key core strength is our differentiated vertically integrated business model that enables us to provide utilityscale pv generation solutions to sustainable geographic markets that have an immediate need for massscale pv electricity 

strategy and competitive strengths 

to build upon our industry leading position and to remain one of the preferred providers of pv energy solutions we are pursuing the following strategies differentiation sustainable growth and financial viability 

differentiation 

 

  4 

the absence of commodity price risk solar energy has a meaningful value proposition including a fixed price for 25 years with relatively low operating costs reliable energy and no risk of fuel price volatility when compared to the price of power derived from a conventional source of energy a fixed price cannot be achieved unless the cost of hedging is included hedging costs of a commodity such as natural gas along with the costs of credit support required for a 25year hedge can significantly increase conventional energy costs

maximize energy output and revenue for our customers while significantly reducing their unplanned maintenance costs plant owners benefit from predictable expenses over the life of the contract and reduced risk of energy loss our goal is to optimize our customers’ power plants to produce the maximum amount of energy production and revenue under their ppa throughout its operational life we have made significant investments in om technologies in order to develop and create a scalable and sustainable om platform our om is compliant with the north american electric reliability corporation “nerc” standards and is designed to be scalable to accommodate the growing om needs of customers worldwide 

sustainable growth 

our long term strategic plan focuses on the transition of our business to primarily sustainable opportunities in executing the ltsp we are focusing on providing solar pv generation solutions using our modules in sustainable geographic markets that we believe have a compelling need for massscale pv electricity including markets throughout the americas asia australia the middle east and africa as part of our ltsp we are focusing on opportunities in which our solar pv generation solutions can compete directly with fossil fuel offerings on an lcoe basis execution of the ltsp entails a reallocation of resources around the globe in particular dedicating resources to regions such as latin america asia the middle east and africa where we have not traditionally conducted significant business to date we are evaluating and managing closely the appropriate level of resources required as we transition into and penetrate these specific markets we have dedicated and intend to continue to dedicate significant capital and human resources to reduce the total installed cost of solar pv generation to optimize the design and logistics associated with our solar pv generation solutions and to ensure that our solutions integrate well into the overall electricity ecosystem of each specific market we expect that over time an increasing portion of our consolidated net sales operating income and cash flows will come from solar offerings in the sustainable markets described above as we execute on our ltsp the timing execution and financial impacts of our ltsp are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in item 1a “risk factors” 

joint ventures or other business arrangements with strategic partners are a key part of our ltsp and we have begun initiatives in several markets using such arrangements to expedite our penetration of those markets and establish relationships with potential customers and policymakers some of these business arrangements have involved and are expected in the future to involve significant investments or other allocations of capital on our part we are in the process of developing relationships with policymakers regulators and especially end customers in each of these markets with a view to creating markets for utility scale pv solar power systems we sell solar power solutions directly to end customers including independent power producers utilities retail electricity providers and commercial and industrial customers depending on the market opportunity our sales offerings range from moduleonly sales to module sales with a range of development engineering procurement and construction services and solutions to full turnkey pv solar power system sales we expect these sales offerings to continue to evolve over time as we work with our customers to optimize how our pv solar generation solutions can best meet our customers’ energy and economic needs 

financial viability 

first solar has demonstrated the consistent ability to generate returns on invested capital in excess of its weighted average cost of capital despite substantial downward pressure on the price of solar modules due to significant excess capacity in the industry we have continued to deliver strong financial performance and liquidity as planned we expect to continue to drive operating expense efficiencies and improvements while still investing in growth the continued development of our global sales capabilities and our rd roadmap we seek to balance our incentive compensation and decisionmaking processes to ensure we direct our efforts and investments towards longterm profitable and sustainable growth with appropriate returns on invested capital and reinvest excess returns back into the business 

offerings and capabilities 

offerings 

we are focusing our resources in markets and on energy applications in which solar power can be a leastcost bestfit energy solution particularly in regions with high solar resources significant current or projected electricity demand andor relatively high existing electricity prices we differentiate our product offering by geographic market and localize the solution as needed our consultative approach to our customers’ solar energy needs and capabilities results in customized solutions to meet their economic goals we have designed our customer solutions according to the needs of the following different business areas although we have substantial experience with the utilityscale power plant and advanced pv module offerings described below our other offerings are in various stages of development and we currently have limited experience with them

global markets 

as part of our long term strategic plan we have established and are continuing to develop a localized business presence on six continents as described below energy markets are by their nature localized with different drivers and market forces impacting 

 8 

electricity generation in a particular region or for a particular application accordingly our business is evolving worldwide and shaped by the varying ways in which our pv solar solutions can be a compelling and economically viable solution to energy needs in different markets and applications 

the americas 

 

 

in early 2013 we acquired solar chile a santiagobased solar development company solar chile has a portfolio of utilityscale pv power projects in varying stages of development currently totaling approximately 1 gw in northern chile including the atacama desert region which offers the highest solar irradiance in the world as a result of our investment in chile we have developed capabilities that allow us to carry out development activities and perform epc and om services 

 

europe middle east and africa 

 

in europe which accounted for approximately 5  of our 2013 net sales we have been engaged in project development activities with respect to certain projects in germany and the uk and we are actively evaluating additional project opportunities in turkey israel and emerging southeastern european markets as well as mature western european solar markets in 2013 we entered into a joint venture with belectric solarkraftwerke gmbh to realize solar energy projects on three continents the joint venture is based in germany and is tasked with developing selected pv power projects independently acquired or developed by either of the two companies in europe north africa as well as projects of fewer than 20 megawatts in the united states under the terms of the joint venture first solar will supply its thinfilm modules selected components such as the first solar tracker and valueadded services while belectric will provide its advanced balance of systems and a range of service capabilities both companies’ engineering procurement and construction contributions will vary by project and geography 

  9 

vulnerable to governmental inertia political instability geopolitical risk fossil fuel subsidization potentially stringent localization requirements and limited available infrastructure 

first solar is pursuing a wide range of opportunities to support the mena region’s efforts to cultivate its considerable solar resources we established an office in dubai and we are in the process of setting up an office in saudi arabia we constructed a 13 mw dc pv power plant for dubai electricity  water authority “dewa” in seih al dahal approximately 50 kilometers south of dubai this is the first phase of the landmark mohammad bin rashid al maktoum solar park an aed 12 billion project that is expected to eventually produce 1 gw of clean energy for the uae’s national grid using both pv and solar thermal technology 

 

asiapacific “apac” 

 

in 2012 first solar completed construction of the 10 mw greenough river solar farm in western australia in cooperation with verve energy and ge energy financial services greenough river solar farm is the largest pv solar farm in operation in australia in addition to supplying over 150000 of its thin film pv modules and epc services for the plant first solar is providing om services under a 15 year contract in 2013 agl energy limited “agl” engaged first solar to construct a 102 mw solar power plant at nyngan and a 53 mw solar project at broken hill both located in new south wales we executed engineering procurement and construction contracts with agl to supply the projects with our advanced thinfilm pv modules and provide epc services in addition first solar will provide maintenance support for a period of five years once the solar farms are operational the projects are supported by commonwealth government funding through the australian renewable energy agency as well as funding from the new south wales government the nyngan and broken hill solar projects will be australia’s largest utilityscale solar projects respectively construction of the nyngan project commenced in january 2014 and commercial operation is expected by mid2015 construction of the broken hill project is expected to start approximately in mid2014 and is scheduled to reach commercial operation before the end of 2015 in addition to our engagement with agl we entered into a collaboration and shareholder arrangement with ingenero pty ltd to provide a joint offering to the commercial and offgrid solar markets the partnership combines ingenero’s design development and integration experience with our advanced thinfilm pv module technology and demonstrated track record in utilityscale projects to better meet market requirements within australia and the apac region 

  10 

the upfront cash incentives the federal government crafted a net fit policy requiring electric power utilities to buy excess electricity generated by pv systems at a premium rate a fit program was launched in 2012 for nonresidential systems which served as one of the key factors driving demand in japan during the year 

we established a japan operating subsidiary and opened an office in tokyo to effectively pursue growth opportunities we are expecting to partner with japanese companies to develop construct and operate solar power plants mitigating japan’s dependence on nuclear power and natural gas fuel imports in 2013 first solar entered into an agreement with jx nippon oil  energy corporation to distribute high efficiency solar photovoltaic modules based on high efficiency high quality crystalline silicon technology we obtained through our acquisition of tetrasun inc in 2013 in japan through april 2015 during the fourth quarter of 2013 we started construction of a solar project in kitakyushushi japan using our cdte pv modules the 14 mw dc project is expected to start operating in the first quarter of 2014 

 

in addition to national level initiatives various indian states have also embarked on solar power programs at the state level renewable purchase obligations “rpos” have been introduced to help drive the pv market in india affected electricity consumers can achieve their purchase obligations by setting up their own installation or purchasing power directly through a ppa alternatively they can purchase solar renewable energy certificates from other producers to meet their target 

in 2012 first solar entered into module supply agreements and joint venture agreements with kiran energy solar power pvt ltd and mahindra solar one pvt ltd for the supply of first solar’s advanced thinfilm solar modules for two solar pv power plants totaling 50 mw dc in india’s rajasthan state in addition first solar made an equity investment in the aforementioned solar power plants the two adjacent projects which together are one of india’s largest pv installations are part of the second batch of utilityscale solar projects concluded under india’s jnnsm construction on both projects was completed in the first quarter of 2013 first solar in india is seeking to develop utility scale solar pv projects address the energyrpo needs of the utilities and also target the open access industrial and commercial power demand options such as partnering with local entrepreneurs to develop solutions for segments in the energy access market and creating solutions by combining solar pv with other modes of generation and reduce dependence on liquid fuels especially in backup or even primary power markets are also being explored for a description of some of the risks associated with our efforts in india see “item 1a risk factors  risks related to our markets and customers  our ability to pursue an expansion strategy in india could be adversely affected by protectionist or other adverse public policies” 

 

support programs 

although our long term strategic plan provides for first solar to transition over time toward operating in sustainable markets that do not require solar specific government subsidies or support programs in the nearterm our net sales and profits remain subject to variability based on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives support programs for pv solar electricity generation depending on the jurisdiction include fits quotas including renewable portfolio standards and tendering systems and net energy metering programs in addition to these support programs financial incentives for pv solar electricity generation include tax incentives grants loans rebates and production incentives although we expect to become less impacted by and less dependent on support programs as we execute our ltsp and transition into primarily sustainable markets support programs will continue to play varying roles in accelerating the adoption of pv solar systems around the world 

in europe renewable energy targets in conjunction with fits have contributed to the growth in pv solar markets renewable energy targets prescribe how much energy consumption must come from renewable sources while fit policies are intended to support new supply development by providing investor certainty a 2009 european union “eu” directive on renewable energy which replaced an earlier 2001 directive sets varying targets for all eu member states in support of the directive’s goal of a 20 

 11 

share of energy from renewable sources in the eu by 2020 and requires national action plans that establish clear pathways for the development of renewable energy sources 

tax incentive programs exist in the us at both the federal and state level and can take the form of investment and production tax credits accelerated depreciation and sales and property tax exemptions and abatements at the federal level investment tax credits for business and residential solar systems have gone through several cycles of enactment and expiration since the 1980’s in october 2008 the us congress extended the 30 federal energy investment tax credit “itc” for both residential and commercial solar installations for eight years through december 31 2016 the itc is a primary economic driver of solar installations in the us its extension through 2016 has contributed to greater medium term demand visibility in the us however its expiration at the end of 2016 unless extended underscores the need for the lcoe from solar systems to continue to decline toward grid parity the expiration of the 30 itc poses significant uncertainties regarding future of us pv solar market demand 

the majority of states in the us have enacted legislation adopting renewable portfolio standards “rps” mechanisms under an rps regulated utilities and other load serving entities are required to procure a specified percentage of their total electricity sales to enduser customers from eligible renewable resources such as solar generating facilities by a specified date some programs may further require that a specified portion of the total percentage of renewable energy must come from solar generating facilities rps legislation and implementing regulations vary significantly from state to state particularly with respect to the percentage of renewable energy required to achieve the state’s rps the definition of eligible renewable energy resources and the extent to which renewable energy credits certificates representing the generation of renewable energy qualify for rps compliance measured in terms of the volume of renewable electricity required to meet its rps mandate california’s rps program is the most significant in the us and the california market for renewable energy dominates the western us region first enacted in 2002 california’s rps statute has been amended several times to increase the overall percentage requirement as well as to accelerate the target date for program compliance pursuant to amendments enacted by the california legislature in 2011 the california rps program now requires utilities and other obligated load serving entities to procure 33 of their retail electricity demand from eligible renewable resources by 2020 in 2013 approximately 77  of our total net sales were derived from our systems projects or thirdparty module sales to solar power systems in california 

business segments 

we operate our business in two segments our components segment involves the design manufacture and sale of solar modules which convert sunlight into electricity we manufacture cdte modules and we also expect to begin manufacturing highefficiency crystalline silicon modules by the end of 2014 thirdparty customers of our components segment include project developers system integrators and owners and operators of pv solar power systems 

our second segment is our fully integrated systems business “systems segment” through which we provide complete turnkey pv solar power systems or solar solutions that draw upon our capabilities which include i project development ii epc services iii om services and iv project finance expertise all as described in more detail below we may provide our full epc services or any combination of individual products and services within our epc capabilities depending upon the customer and market opportunity all of our systems segment products and services are generally for pv solar power systems which use our solar modules and such products and services are sold directly to investor owned utilities independent power developers and producers commercial and industrial companies and other pv solar power system owners any other revenues from other services not related to the design manufacture and sale of solar modules is reflected in this segment 

see note 23 “segment and geographical information”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2013  included in this annual report on form 10k for further information on our business segments 

components business 

our components business involves the design manufacture and sale of solar modules which convert sunlight into electricity 

solar modules 

cdte modules  our flagship module since the inception of first solar has been manufactured using our advanced cdte thinfilm technology each solar module is a glass laminate approximately 2ft x 4ft 60cm x 120cm in size that encapsulates a cdte thinfilm semiconductor our solar modules had an average rated power per module of approximately 91 watts  86 watts  and 80 watts  for 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively during 2013 we announced the release of our series 3 black and series 3 black plus modules the series 3 black module is the first thinfilm module to pass independently validated thresher and long term sequential extended reliability tests providing added confidence in long term harsh climate performance the series 3 black plus 

 12 

adds innovative semiconductor technology enhancements that allow significant improvement in our long term power output degradation guidance and associated warranties our semiconductor structure is a singlejunction polycrystalline thinfilm that uses cdte as the absorption layer cdte has absorption properties that are matched to the solar spectrum and can deliver competitive conversion efficiencies using only about 12 of the amount of semiconductor material ie silicon that is used to manufacture traditional crystalline silicon solar modules one of the drivers of first solar modules’ performance advantage over crystalline silicon modules is a lower temperature coefficient delivering higher energy yields at elevated operating temperature typical of utilityscale solar power plants in sunny regions 

crystalline silicon modules  in 2013 we acquired tetrasun for its high efficiency crystalline silicon technology for deployment in space constrained applications we expect to begin manufacturing modules incorporating such technology by the end of 2014 

descriptions below of our components business relate to our cdte modules unless otherwise noted 

manufacturing process 

we manufacture our cdte solar modules on highthroughput production lines and perform all manufacturing steps ourselves in an automated proprietary and continuous process our solar modules employ a thin layer of semiconductor material to convert sunlight into electricity our manufacturing process eliminates the multiple supply chain operators and expensive and timeconsuming batch processing steps that are used to produce crystalline silicon solar modules currently we manufacture our solar modules at our perrysburg ohio and kulim malaysia manufacturing facilities 

we have integrated our cdte manufacturing processes into a continuous production line with the following three stages the deposition stage the cell definition and treatment stage and the assembly and test stage in the deposition stage panels of transparent oxidecoated glass are robotically loaded onto the production line where they are cleaned heated and coated with thin layers of cadmium sulfide followed by a layer of cdte using our proprietary vapor transport deposition technology after which the semiconductorcoated plates are cooled rapidly to increase strength in the cell definition and treatment stage we use high speed lasers to transform the large single semiconductor coating on the glass plate into a series of interconnected cells that deliver the desired current and voltage output in this stage we also treat the semiconductor film using proprietary chemistries and processes to improve the device performance and we apply a metal terminated sputtered back contact finally in the assembly and test stage we apply busbars interlaminate material and a rear glass cover sheet that is laminated to encapsulate the semiconductor a junction box and termination wires are then applied to complete the assembly the final assembly stage is the only stage in our production line that requires manual processing 

we maintain a robust quality and reliability assurance program that monitors critical process parameters to ensure that industry and internal standards are met this rigorous set of evaluations is conducted prior to each solar module undergoing acceptance testing for both electrical leakage and power measurement on a solar simulator the quality and reliability tests complement production surveillance with an ongoing monitoring program subjecting production modules to accelerated life cycle and stress testing to ensure conformance to iec and ul requirements this program assures a high level of product quality and reliability helping to predict power performance in the field 

research development and engineering 

we continue to devote substantial resources to research and development with the primary objective of lowering the lifecycle cost of electricity generated by our pv systems we conduct our research and development activities primarily in the united states within our components business we focus our research and development activities on among other areas continuing to increase the conversion efficiency and energy yield of our solar modules and continuously improving durability and manufacturing efficiencies including throughput improvement volume ramp and material cost reduction 

in the course of our research and development activities we continuously explore and research technologies in our efforts to sustain competitive differentiation in our modules we typically qualify process and product improvements for full production at our perrysburg ohio plant and then use a systematic process to propagate them to our other production lines we believe that our systematic approach to technology change management will provide continuous improvements and ensure uniform adoption across our production lines in addition our cdte production lines are replicas or near replicas of each other and as a result a process or production improvement on one line can be rapidly deployed to other production lines 

we regularly produce research cells in our laboratories some of which are tested for performance and certified by independent labs such as the national renewable energy laboratory cell efficiency measures the proportion of light converted in a single solar cell at standard test conditions our research cells are produced using laboratory equipment and methods and are not intended 

 13 

to be representative of our manufacturing capability we believe that our record cells demonstrate a potential longterm module efficiency entitlement of over 18 using our commercial scale manufacturing equipment 

during 2013 we acquired ge’s global cdte solar intellectual property portfolio setting a course for significant advancement of our pv thinfilm solar technology the combination of the two companies’ complementary technologies and first solar’s existing manufacturing capabilities are expected to accelerate the development of cdte solar module performance and improve efficiency at manufacturing scale in addition ge global research and first solar rd are collaborating on future technology development to further advance cdte solar technology pursuant to an agreement through 2014 

customers 

  

with respect to our components business during 2013 we sold the majority of our solar modules not included in our systems projects to solar power system project developers system integrators and operators headquartered in germany france portugal india and the united states which either resell our solar modules to endusers or integrate them into solar power plants that they own operate or sell thirdparty module sales represented approximately 12 of our total 2013 net sales additionally we develop design construct and sell pv solar power systems that use the solar modules we manufacture 

during 2013 aes  midamerican renewables llc  and nextera energy  individually accounted for more than 10 of our components segment’s net sales which includes the solar modules used in our systems projects we are investing in sustainable market development particularly in areas with abundant solar resources and sizable electricity demand and as part of such efforts we are seeking to develop additional customer relationships in sustainable markets and regions which has reduced and is expected to continue to reduce our customer and geographic concentration and dependence 

competition 

the renewable energy solar energy and solar module sectors are highly competitive and continually evolving as participants in these sectors strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete within the larger electric power industry we face intense competition for sales of solar modules which has resulted in and may continue to result in reduced margins and loss of market share with respect to our components business our primary sources of competition are currently crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers as well as other thinfilm module manufacturers and companies developing solar thermal and concentrated pv technologies certain of our existing or future competitors may be part of larger corporations that have greater financial resources and greater brand name recognition than we do and as a result may be better positioned to adapt to changes in the industry or the economy as a whole certain competitors may have direct or indirect access to sovereign capital which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time among pv module and cell manufacturers the principal methods of competition include sales price per watt conversion efficiency reliability warranty terms and customer payment terms in 2013 industry average module pricing stabilized but remained low relative to the prior fiveyear period if competitors reduce module pricing to levels near or below their manufacturing costs or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time our results of operations could be adversely affected at december 31 2013 the global pv industry consisted of more than approximately 75 manufacturers of solar modules and cells in the aggregate these manufacturers had installed production capacity that significantly exceeded global demand in 2013 we believe the solar industry will continue to experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity exceeds global demand and that such periods will put pressure on pricing which could adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition we expect to compete with future entrants to the pv industry that offer new technological solutions we also face competition from semiconductor manufacturers and semiconductor equipment manufacturers or their customers that produce pv cells solar modules or turnkey production lines 

we also face competition from companies that currently offer or are developing other renewable energy technologies including wind hydropower geothermal biomass and tidal technologies and other power generation sources that employ conventional fossil fuels 

raw materials 

our cdte module manufacturing process uses approximately 30 types of raw materials and components to construct a complete solar module one critical raw material in our production process is cadmium telluride of the other raw materials and components the following eight are also critical to our manufacturing process front glass coated with transparent conductive oxide cadmium sulfide photo resist laminate material tempered back glass cord platecord plate cap lead wire and solar connectors before we use these materials and components in our manufacturing process a supplier must undergo a rigorous qualification process we 

 14 

continually evaluate new suppliers and currently are qualifying several new suppliers and materials when possible we attempt to use suppliers that can provide a raw material supply source that is near our manufacturing locations reducing the cost and lead times for such materials a few of our critical materials or components are single sourced and most others are supplied by a limited number of suppliers 

solar module collection and recycling program 

first solar is committed to extended producer responsibility and takes into account the environmental impact of its products over their entire life cycle we established the solar industry’s first comprehensive module collection and recycling program first solar’s module recycling process is designed to maximize the recovery of valuable materials including the glass and encapsulated semiconductor material for use in new modules or other new products and minimizes the environmental impacts associated with our modules at the end of their useful life approximately 90 of each collected first solar module can be recycled into materials for use in new products including new solar modules 

in the fourth quarter of 2012 we made changes to our collection and recycling program outside the eu under this program change customers as part of their overall power plant decommissioning obligations are now responsible for ensuring modules are either recycled or responsibly disposed of at the end of their useful life first solar offers termbased recycling services to customers to help them meet these obligations this change supports our ongoing transition to being a provider of adaptable solar energy solutions for our power plant customers the change in first solar’s recycling program provides power plant owners with flexibility in determining endoflife module disposition with options that enable them to more efficiently manage their capital and improve their financial returns for example our financial projections indicate that funding the cost of endoflife module recycling through project cash flows can save power plant owners considerably more than a prefunded approach due to the higher returns generated from the project cash flows 

the european union’s waste electronics and electrical equipment “weee” directive places the obligation of recycling including collection treatment and environmentally sound disposal of electrical and electronic equipment “eee” products upon producers over the next few years this directive will also be applicable to solar pv modules for modules sold to and installed in the eu we continue to maintain a commitment to cover and prefund the estimated collection and recycling costs consistent with our historical program prior to the changes made in the fourth quarter of 2012 however as the detailed legal requirements of the transposed weee directive become known in 2014 we will adjust the program in the various eu member states as required to ensure compliance with the different regulations additionally for all modules subject to a sales arrangement prior to the above discussed change we have an obligation and will maintain the commitment to collect and recycle such covered modules consistent with our historical prefunded solar module collection and recycling program 

for our prefunded collection and recycling program we continue to fund the estimated collection and recycling cost incremental to amounts already prefunded in prior years for the cumulative modules covered by the program within 90 days of the end of each fiscal year assuming for this purpose a minimum service life of 25 years for our solar modules in addition to achieving substantial environmental benefits our solar module collection and recycling program may provide us the opportunity to resell or redistribute working modules or recover certain raw materials and components for reuse in our manufacturing process we currently have recycling facilities operating at each manufacturing facility with sufficient capacity for manufacturing scrap anticipated warranty returns and modules collected at the end of their useful life over the next several years that produce glass suitable for use in the production of new glass products and unrefined semiconductor materials that will be further processed by a third party supplier and then used to produce semiconductor materials for use in new solar modules 

to ensure that the prefunded amounts for covered modules under the program are available regardless of our financial status in the future a trust structure has been established funds are put into custodial accounts in the name of a trustee only the trustee can distribute funds from the custodial accounts for qualified collection and recycling costs these funds cannot be accessed for any purpose other than for qualified module collection and recycling costs of first solar modules such collection and recycling services will either be performed by us or a third party end users with solar modules covered by our prefunded program can request collection and recycling of their eligible solar modules by us at any time at no additional cost

we provide a limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for 10 years following delivery to the owners of our solar modules we also typically warrant to our owners that solar modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 90 of their labeled power output rating during the first 10 years following their installation and at least 80 of their labeled power output rating during the following 15 years in resolving claims under both the defects and power output warranties we have the option of either repairing or replacing the covered solar modules or under the power output warranty providing additional solar modules to remedy the power shortfall we also have the 

 15 

option to make a payment for the then current market price for solar modules to resolve claims our warranties are automatically transferred from the original purchasers of our solar modules to subsequent purchasers upon resale in 2013 we announced to our customers the availability of a new linear power output warranty for modules shipping beginning in the second quarter of 2014 

as an alternative to our module power output warranty we have offered a system level module performance warranty for a limited number of our recent system sales this system level module performance warranty is designed for utility scale systems and provides 25year plantlevel energy degradation protection the system level module performance warranty typically is calculated as a percentage of a system’s expected energy production adjusted for certain actual site conditions with the warranted level of performance declining each year in a linear fashion but never falling below 80 during the term of the warranty in resolving claims under the system level module performance warranty to restore the system to warranted performance levels we first must validate that the root cause is due to module performance then we typically have the option of either repairing or replacing modules providing supplemental modules or making a cash payment consistent with our module power output warranty when we elect to satisfy a valid warranty claim by providing replacement or supplement modules under the system level module performance warranty we do not have any obligation to pay for the labor to remove or install modules 

currently only a small percentage of our systems projects are subject to such system level module performance warranty but we expect that this percentage will increase in the future as we extend it to future systems sales arrangements we do not anticipate that the system level module performance warranty will have a material impact on our future warranty claim rates as such warranty is designed to be in line with the expected riskadjusted aggregate performance of our modules the offering of such system level warranty addresses the challenge of identifying from the potential millions of modules installed in a utility scale system individual modules that are performing below warranty by focusing on the energy generated by the system rather than the capacity of individual modules 

 from time to time we have taken remediation actions with respect to affected modules beyond our limited warranty and we may elect to do so in the future in which case we would incur additional expenses such potential voluntary future remediation actions beyond our limited warranty obligation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations if we commit to any such remediation actions 

systems business 

through our fully integrated systems business we provide a complete turnkey solar power system solution or any combination of our systems solutions which may include project development epc services om services and project finance 

our systems business has grown over the past several years through a combination of business acquisitions and organic growth in april 2009 we completed the acquisition of the project development business of optisolar inc which included a multigigawatt project pipeline in july 2010 we completed the acquisition of nextlight renewable power llc “nextlight” a leading developer of utilityscale solar projects in the southwestern united states which also included a multigigawatt project pipeline in january 2013 we acquired solar chile a santiagobased solar development company solar chile has a portfolio of utilityscale pv power projects in varying stages of development currently totaling approximately 1 gw in northern chile including the atacama desert region which offers the highest solar irradiance in the world in addition in august 2013 we acquired a pipeline of us and mexico development assets from element power included in the 15 gw pipeline are diverse projects in various stages of development in california arizona texas georgia north carolina colorado louisiana illinois and mexico the projects are competitively positioned in their respective markets have secured site options and interconnect queue positions and are at various stages of environmental screening and permitting 

project development 

project development activities include site selection and securing rights to acquire or use the site obtaining in a timely manner the requisite interconnection and transmission studies executing an interconnection agreement obtaining environmental and land use permits maintaining effective site control and entering into a power purchase agreement with an offtaker of the power to be generated by the project these activities culminate in receiving the right to construct and operate a solar power system depending on the market opportunity or geographic location we may acquire projects in various stages of development or acquire project companies from developers in order to complete the development process construct a pv power plant incorporating our modules and sell the system to a longterm project owner or in certain cases operate the system on our own depending on the market opportunity or geographic location we may collaborate with local partners in connection with these project development activities depending on the type of project or geographic location ppas or fit structures define the price and terms the utility customer or investor will pay for power produced from a project entering into a ppa generally provides the underlying economics needed to finalize development including permitting beginning construction arranging financing and marketing the project for sale to a longterm project owner depending primarily on the location stage of development upon our 

 16 

acquisition of the project and other site attributes the development cycle typically ranges from one to five years we may be required to incur significant costs for preliminary engineering permitting legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built if there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals we may be forced to incur additional costs writedown capitalized project assets and the right of the offtaker under the ppa to terminate may be triggered 

customers 

with respect to our systems business our customers consist of investor owned utilities independent power developers and producers commercial and industrial companies and other system owners who may purchase from us completed solar power plants which include our solar modules any combination of epc services and om services for the plants we build during 2013 the substantial majority of our systems business sales were generated in north america 

during 2013 the principal customers of our systems segment were nextera energy  midamerican renewables llc  exelon corporation  general electric company  and sumitomo corporation of america  each of which also accounted for more than 10 of our systems segment net sales during 2013 

competition 

with respect to our systems business we face competition from other providers of renewable energy solutions including developers of pv solar thermal and concentrated solar power systems and developers of other forms of renewable energy projects including wind hydropower geothermal biomass and tidal projects to the extent other solar module manufacturers become more vertically integrated we expect to face increased competition from such companies as well we also face competition from other epc companies and joint venture type arrangements between epc companies and solar companies certain current or potential future competitors may also have a low cost of capital andor access to foreign capital while the decline in pv modules prices over the last several years has increased interest in solar electricity worldwide there are limited barriers of entry in many parts of the pv solar value chain depending on the geographic market accordingly competition at the systems level can be intense thereby exerting downward pressure on systems level profit margins industrywide to the extent competitors are willing and able to bid aggressively low prices for new projects and ppas using low cost assumptions for modules bos components installation maintenance and other costs please see item 1a “risk factors  competition at the systems level can be intense depending on the market opportunity thereby potentially exerting downward pressure on systems level profit margins industrywide which could reduce our net sales profitability and adversely affect our results of operations” 

epc warranty 

in addition to our solar module warranties described above for solar power plants built by our systems business we typically provide a limited warranty on the balance of the system against defects in engineering design installation and workmanship for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a phase or the entire solar power plant in resolving claims under the engineering design installation and workmanship warranties we have the option of remedying the defect through repair or replacement 

as part of our systems business we conduct performance testing of the solar power plant prior to substantial completion to confirm the power plant meets operational and capacity expectations noted in the epc agreement in addition we may provide an energy generation performance test during the first year of the solar power plant’s operation such a test is designed to demonstrate that the actual energy generation for the first year meets or exceeds the modeled energy expectation after certain adjustments and exclusions if there is an underperformance event determined at the end of the first year after substantial completion we may incur liquidated damages as a percentage of the epc contract price in some instances a bonus payment may be received at the end of the first year if the power plant performs above a certain level in limited cases a similar energy generation test is offered as part of our operations and maintenance service up to a maximum of five years in such a case liquidated damages are incurred at the lost energy price noted in the ppa 

research development and engineering 

our systems business research and development activities are primarily focused on the objective of lowering the lcoe through reductions in bos costs improved systems design and energy yield enhancements associated with pv systems that use our solar modules these rd efforts are also focused on continuing to improve our systems in terms of grid stabilization we conduct our research and development activities for the systems business primarily in the united states innovations related to system design hardware platforms inverters trackers and installation techniques and know how among other things can and 

 17 

are expected in the future to continue to reduce bos costs which can represent a significant portion of the costs associated with the construction of a typical utilityscale pv solar power system 

own and operate 

from time to time we may temporarily own and operate certain pv solar systems with the intention to sell at a later date the ability to do so allows us to gain control of the sales process provide a lower risk profile to a future buyer of a pv solar system and improve our ability to drive higher eventual sale values as of february 2014 we own and operate one completed solar power plant we also currently own two additional solar power plants under construction that are delivering power to the grid as an owner and operator of these pv solar systems we and certain of our operating subsidiaries are subject to the authority of the ferc as well as various other local state and federal regulatory bodies for more information about risks related to owning and operating pv solar power systems please see item 1a “risk factors  as a temporary owner and operator of certain pv solar systems that are delivering electricity to the grid certain of our indirect subsidiaries are regulated as a public utility under us federal and state law which could adversely affect the cost of doing business and limit our growth” for more information about the economics of such ownership and the impacts on our liquidity see item 7 “management discussion and analysis  liquidity and capital resources” 

intellectual property 

our success depends in part on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technology and to conduct our business without infringing on the proprietary rights of others we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks and trade secrets as well as associate and third party confidentiality agreements to safeguard our intellectual property we regularly file patent applications to protect inventions arising from our research and development and are currently pursuing patent applications in the us and worldwide our patent applications and any future patent applications might not result in a patent being issued with the scope of the claims we seek or at all and any patents we may receive may be challenged invalidated or declared unenforceable in addition we have registered andor have applied to register trademarks and service marks in the us and a number of foreign countries for “first solar” and “first solar and design” 

with respect to proprietary knowhow that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce we rely on among other things trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests we believe that many elements of our pv module manufacturing process including our unique materials sourcing involve proprietary knowhow technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications including technical processes equipment designs algorithms and procedures we have taken security measures to protect these elements our research and development personnel have entered into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us these agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our associates to assign to us all of the inventions designs and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us we also require our customers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our modules technology or business plans 

we have not been subject to any material intellectual property infringement or misappropriation claims 

environmental health and safety matters 

our operations include the use handling storage transportation generation and disposal of hazardous materials and hazardous wastes we are subject to various national state local and international laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the use management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes occupational health and safety and the cleanup of contaminated sites therefore we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions and costs arising from third party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations or noncompliance with environmental permits required for our operations we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety requirements and do not expect to incur material expenditures for environmental and occupational health and safety controls in the foreseeable future however future developments such as the implementation of new more stringent laws and regulations more aggressive enforcement policies or the discovery of unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition see item 1a “risk factors  environmental obligations and liabilities could have a substantial negative impact on our financial condition cash flows and profitability”

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the following information together with the other information in this annual report on form 10k before buying shares of our stock if any of the following risks or uncertainties occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our stock could decline 

  

risks related to our markets and customers 

an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may continue to cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

solar manufacturers had installed production capacity that significantly exceeded global demand during the past several years we believe the solar industry will continue to experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity exceeds global demand and that such periods will put pressure on pricing in light of the increase in global production capacity we engaged in a series of restructuring initiatives in 2012 to better align production with expected market demand including the closure of our german manufacturing operations in 2012 during the past several years industry average sales prices per watt “asps” have declined significantly as competitors reduced asps to sellthrough inventories worldwide if our competitors reduce module pricing to levels near or below their manufacturing costs or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time or if demand for pv modules does not grow sufficiently to justify the current production supply our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

competition at the systems level can be intense thereby potentially exerting downward pressure on systems level profit margins industrywide which could reduce our net sales profitability and adversely affect our results of operations 

the significant decline in pv module prices over the last several years has and continues to create a challenging environment for module manufacturers but it has also increased interest in solar electricity worldwide by eroding one of the primary historical constraints to widespread solar market penetration namely its affordability aided by such lower module prices competitors have in many cases been willing and able to bid aggressively for new projects and ppas using low cost assumptions for modules bos components installation maintenance and other costs as the basis for such bids achievable barriers to entry for competitors has led to depending on the market and other factors intense competition at the systems level intense competition at the systems level can result in an environment in which systems level pricing falls rapidly thereby further increasing demand for solar solutions but constraining the ability for project developers epc companies andor verticallyintegrated solar companies such as first solar to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability accordingly while we believe our systems offerings and experience are positively differentiated in many cases from that of our competitors we may be unable to develop or maintain a sufficient magnitude of new systems projects worldwide at economically attractive rates of return and may not be able to achieve meaningful profitability under our long term strategic plan 

depending on the market opportunity we may be at a disadvantage compared to potential systemslevel competitors for example certain of our competitors may have a stronger andor more established localized business presence in a particular geographic region certain of our competitors may be larger entities that have greater financial resources and greater overall brand name recognition than we do and as a result may be better positioned to impact customer behavior or adapt to changes in the industry or the economy as a whole certain competitors may also have direct or indirect access to sovereign capital which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time 

additionally largescale solar systems are still in their relatively early stages of existence and depending on the geographic area many potential customers are still in the process of educating themselves about the points of differentiation among various available providers of pv solar solutions including a company’s proven overall experience and bankability system design and optimization expertise grid interconnection and stabilization expertise and proven om capabilities if we are unable over time to meaningfully differentiate our offerings at scale from the viewpoint of our potential customer base our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

if pv technology is not suitable for widespread adoption at economically attractive rates of return or if sufficient additional demand for solar modules does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate our net sales and profit may flatten or decline and we may be unable to sustain profitability 

 21 

the solar energy market is at a relatively early stage of development in comparison to fossil fuelbased electricity generation if pv technology proves unsuitable for widespread adoption at economically attractive rates of return or if additional demand for solar modules and systems fails to develop sufficiently or takes longer to develop than we anticipate we may be unable to grow our business or generate sufficient net sales to sustain profitability in addition demand for solar modules and systems in our targeted markets may develop to a lesser extent than we anticipate many factors may affect the viability of widespread adoption of pv technology and demand for solar modules and systems including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reduced growth in or the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives renewable energy targets and other support for ongrid solar electricity applications or increase in protectionist or other adverse public policies could reduce demand andor price levels for our solar modules and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales and adversely impact our operating results 

although our long term strategic plan provides for first solar to transition over time toward operating in sustainable markets that do not require solar specific government subsidies or support programs and it is our belief that solar pv will experience widespread adoption in those applications where it competes economically with traditional forms of energy without any support programs in the nearterm our net sales and profits remain subject to variability based on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives federal state and local governmental bodies in many countries have provided subsidies in the form of fits rebates tax incentives and other incentives to endusers distributors systems integrators and manufacturers of pv products many of these support programs expire phase out over time require renewal by the applicable authority or may be amended in particular the expiration of the us federal investment tax credit set for 2016 poses significant uncertainties regarding us pv solar market demand a summary of recent developments in the major government support programs that can impact our business appears under item 1 “business – support programs” to the extent these support programs are reduced earlier than previously expected or are changed retroactively or freefield or conversion land applications are disadvantaged such changes could reduce demand andor price levels for our solar modules and systems lead to a reduction in our net sales and adversely impact our operating results while the expected potential of the markets we are targeting is significant policy promulgation and market development are especially vulnerable to governmental inertia political instability geopolitical risk fossil fuel subsidization potentially stringent localization requirements and limited available infrastructure 

our ability to pursue an expansion strategy in india could be adversely affected by protectionist or other adverse public policies 

under phase i of the national solar mission india required developers of solar pv projects employing crystalline silicon technology to use solar cells and modules manufactured in india first solar modules were not impacted by this restriction however in its policy guideline for batch i phase ii of the national solar mission india has set aside 375 mw of the 750 mw program for domestically manufactured cells and modules irrespective of the technology used crystalline silicon or thin film this setaside effectively cuts the ability of first solar to compete in the batch i phase ii program in half in february 2013 the united states government announced that it would expand its previously requested world trade organization dispute settlement consultations with the government of india on phase i local content requirements “lcrs” to include consultations on the lcrs in phase ii the outcome of the consultation is still pending 

 22 

in addition india is investigating potential dumping of solar cells and modules from the us malaysia taiwan and china first solar is cooperating fully with the indian government on this investigation we expect a final decision on the case by the end of 2014 if we are deemed to have dumped our modules in india to the detriment of the domestic industry we could be assessed antidumping duties and our ability to compete against domestic manufacturers andor other exporters to india not affected by duties could be impaired 

we could be adversely affected by any violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” the uk bribery act and other foreign antibribery laws  

the fcpa generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business other countries in which we operate also have antibribery laws some of which prohibit improper payments to government and nongovernment persons and entities our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we currently operate in and pursuant to our long term strategic plan intend to further expand into many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices in addition due to the level of regulation in our industry our entry into certain jurisdictions including india china south america and the middle east requires substantial government contact where norms can differ from us standards although we implement policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these antibribery laws our employees subcontractors agents and partners such as joint venture partners may take actions in violation of our policies and antibribery laws any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could subject us to criminal andor civil penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and reputation 

  

we may be unable to fully execute on our long term strategic plan which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we face numerous difficulties in executing our long term strategic plan particularly in new foreign jurisdictions including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 23 

 

 

 

 

in addition please see the risk factors entitled “our substantial international operations subject us to a number of risks including unfavorable political regulatory labor and tax conditions in foreign countries” and “reduced growth in or the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidiaries economic incentives and other support for ongrid solar electricity could reduce demand andor price levels for our solar modules and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales and adversely impact our operating results” 

we may be unable to profitably provide new solar offerings or achieve sufficient market penetration with such offerings 

we are in the process of expanding our lineup of offerings to include solutions that build upon our core competencies but for which we have not had significant historical experience with including the ac power block and offerings related to fuel displacement commercial and industrial and distributed generation for restricted spaces and offgrid and energy access we cannot be certain that we will be able to ascertain and allocate the appropriate financial and human resources necessary to grow these business areas we could invest considerable capital into growing these businesses and not experience a satisfactory level of financial return also in expanding into these areas we may be competing against companies that previously have not been significant competitors such as companies that currently have substantially more experience than we do in the rooftop segment if we are unable to achieve growth in these areas our overall growth and financial performance may be limited relative to our competitors and our operating results could be adversely impacted 

an increase in interest rates or lending rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets including a reduction in total tax equity availability could make it difficult for customers to finance the cost of a pv system and could reduce the demand for our solar systems or modules andor lead to a reduction in the average selling price for pv modules 

many of our customers and our systems business depend on debt andor equity financing to fund the initial capital expenditure required to develop build andor purchase a pv system as a result an increase in interest rates or lending rates or a reduction in the supply of project debt financing or tax equity investments could reduce the number of solar projects that receive financing or otherwise make it difficult for our customers or our systems business to secure the financing necessary to develop build purchase or install a pv system on favorable terms or at all and thus lower demand for our solar modules which could limit our growth or reduce our net sales in addition we believe that a significant percentage of our endusers install pv systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt an increase in interest rates andor lending rates could lower an investor’s return on investment in a pv system increase equity return requirements or make alternative investments more attractive relative to pv systems and in each case could cause these endusers to seek alternative investments 

  

risks related to regulations 

existing regulations and policies changes thereto and new regulations and policies may present technical regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of pv products or systems which may significantly reduce demand for our solar modules systems or services 

the market for electricity generation products is heavily influenced by foreign federal state and local government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry as well as policies promulgated by electric utilities these regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customerowned electricity generation in the united states and in a number of other countries these regulations and policies have been modified in the past and may be modified again in the future these regulations and policies could deter enduser purchases of pv products and investment in the research and development of pv technology for example without a mandated regulatory exception for pv systems utility customers are often charged interconnection or standby fees for putting distributed power generation on the electric utility grid if these interconnection standby fees were applicable to pv systems it is likely that they would increase the cost of using pv systems to our endusers 

 24 

which could make them less desirable thereby adversely affecting our business prospects results of operations and financial condition in addition with respect to utilities that utilize a peak hour pricing policy or timeofuse pricing methods whereby the price of electricity is adjusted based on electricity supply and demand electricity generated by pv systems currently benefits from competing primarily with expensive peak hour electricity rather than the less expensive average price of electricity modifications to the peak hour pricing policies of utilities such as to a flat rate for all times of the day would require pv systems to achieve lower prices in order to compete with the price of electricity from other sources and would adversely impact our operating results 

our solar systems modules and services such as om are subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with national and local ordinances relating to building codes safety environmental protection utility interconnection and metering and other matters it is a complex task to track the requirements of individual jurisdictions any new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to our solar modules systems or services may result in significant additional expenses to us or our customers and as a result could cause a significant reduction in demand for our solar modules systems or services in addition any regulatory compliance failure could result in significant management distraction unplanned costs andor reputational damage 

environmental obligations and liabilities could have a substantial negative impact on our financial condition cash flows and profitability 

our operations involve the use handling generation processing storage transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations at the national state local and international levels these environmental laws and regulations include those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the use management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites and occupational health and safety as we execute our long term strategic plan and expand our business into foreign jurisdictions worldwide our environmental compliance burden will continue to increase both in terms of magnitude and complexity we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs and capital expenditures in complying with these laws and regulations in addition violations of or liabilities under environmental laws or permits may result in restrictions being imposed on our operating activities or in our being subjected to substantial fines penalties criminal proceedings third party property damage or personal injury claims cleanup costs or other costs such solutions could also result in substantial delay or termination of projects under construction within our systems business which could adversely impact our results of operations while we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements future developments such as more aggressive enforcement policies the implementation of new more stringent laws and regulations or the discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our solar modules contain cadmium telluride and cadmium sulfide elemental cadmium and certain of its compounds are regulated as hazardous materials due to the adverse health effects that may arise from human exposure based on existing research the risks of exposure to cadmium telluride are not believed to be as serious as those relating to exposure to elemental cadmium in our manufacturing operations we maintain engineering controls to minimize our associates’ exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds and require our associates who handle cadmium compounds to follow certain safety procedures including the use of personal protective equipment such as respirators chemical goggles and protective clothing relevant studies and third party peer review of our technology have concluded that the risk of exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds from our endproducts is negligible in addition the risk of exposure is further minimized by the encapsulated nature of these materials in our products and the physical properties of cadmium compounds used in our products and the recycling or responsible disposal of first solar’s modules while we believe that these factors and procedures are sufficient to protect our associates endusers and the general public from adverse health effects that may arise from cadmium exposure we cannot ensure that human or environmental exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds used in our products will not occur any such exposure could result in future third party claims against us as well as damage to our reputation and heightened regulatory scrutiny of our products which could limit or impair our ability to sell and distribute our products the occurrence of future events such as these could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

the use of cadmium in various products is also subject to governmental regulation in several countries more restrictive regulation in this area andor expansion of such regulation to additional countries could impact the manufacture sale collection and recycling of solar modules and could require us to make unforeseen environmental expenditures or limit our ability to sell and distribute our products 

as a temporary owner and operator of certain pv solar systems that are delivering electricity to the grid certain of our indirect subsidiaries are regulated as a public utility under us federal and state law which could adversely affect the cost of doing business and limit our growth 

as a temporary owner and operator of certain pv solar systems that are delivering electricity to the grid certain of our indirectlyowned operating subsidiaries are considered to be public utilities for purposes of the federal power act as amended 

 25 

the “fpa” and public utility companies for purposes of the public utility holding company act of 2005 “puhca 2005” and are subject to regulation by the federal energy regulatory commission “ferc” as well as various local and state regulatory bodies we currently have three such indirect operating subsidiaries that are delivering electricity to the grid sg2 imperial valley llc “sg2” macho springs solar llc “macho springs” and maryland solar llc “md solar” as of february 2014 the sg2 and macho springs projects are under construction and the md solar project is complete 

sg2 and macho springs are “exempt wholesale generators” or “ewgs” and as such are exempt from regulation under puhca 2005 md solar is a “qualifying facility” or “qf” under the public utility regulatory policies act of 1978 as amended “purpa” and is also exempt from puhca 2005 in addition md solar is exempt from most provisions of the fpa as well as state laws regarding the financial or organizational regulation of public utilities we will also be exempt from regulation under puhca 2005 so long as sg2 and macho springs remain ewgs and so long as md solar remains a qf we are not directly subject to ferc regulation under the fpa however we are considered to be a “holding company” for purposes of section 203 of the fpa which regulates certain transactions involving public utilities and such regulation could adversely affect our ability to grow the business through acquisitions likewise investors seeking to acquire our public utility subsidiaries or acquire ownership interests in our securities sufficient to give them control over us and our public utility subsidiaries may require prior ferc approval to do so such approval could result in transaction delays or uncertainties 

public utilities under the fpa are required to obtain ferc acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of electricity and to comply with various regulations the ferc has granted sg2 and macho springs the authority to sell electricity at marketbased rates and has granted them certain regulatory waivers such as waivers from compliance with ferc’s accounting regulations these ferc orders reserve the right to revoke or revise marketbased sales authority if the ferc subsequently determines that sg2 macho springs or any of their affiliates can exercise market power in the sale of generation products the provision of transmission services or if it finds that any of them can create barriers to entry by competitors in addition if sg2 or macho springs fail to comply with certain reporting obligations the ferc may revoke their power sales tariffs finally if sg2 macho springs or md solar were deemed to have engaged in manipulative or deceptive practices concerning their power sales transactions they would be subject to potential fines disgorgement of profits andor suspension or revocation of their marketbased rate authority if our indirect subsidiaries were to lose their marketbased rate authority such companies would be required to obtain the ferc’s acceptance of a costofservice rate schedule and could become subject to the accounting recordkeeping and reporting requirements that are imposed on utilities with costbased rate schedules which would impose cost and compliance burdens on us and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition to the risks described above we would be subject to additional regulatory regimes at the state and foreign levels to the extent we own and operate pv power plants in the future in other states or foreign jurisdictions such as our barilla plant currently under construction in texas 

  

risks related to our operations manufacturing and technology 

our operating history to date may not serve as an adequate basis to judge our future prospects and results of operations 

our historical operating results may not provide a meaningful basis for evaluating our business financial performance and prospects we may be unable to achieve similar growth or grow at all in future periods our ability to achieve similar growth in future periods is also affected by current economic conditions our past results occurred in an environment where among other things capital was at times more accessible to our customers to finance the cost of developing solar projects and economic incentives for solar power in certain markets such as the german fit were more favorable accordingly you should not rely on our results of operations for any prior period as an indication of our future performance 

we face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules as well as thinfilm solar modules and solar thermal and concentrated pv systems if global supply exceeds global demand it could lead to a reduction in the average selling price for pv modules  which could reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations 

the solar energy and renewable energy industries are highly competitive and continually evolving as participants strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete with the larger electric power industry within the global pv industry we face competition from crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers other thinfilm solar module manufacturers and companies developing solar thermal and concentrated pv technologies existing or future solar manufacturers might be acquired by larger companies with significant capital resources thereby intensifying competition with us in addition the introduction of a low cost disruptive technology could adversely affect our ability to compete which could reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations 

even if demand for solar modules continues to grow the rapid manufacturing capacity expansion undertaken by many solar module manufacturers particularly manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules has created and may continue to cause periods of structural imbalance during which supply exceeds demand see “an increased global supply of pv modules has caused 

 26 

and may continue to cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations” in addition we believe a significant decrease in the cost of silicon feedstock would provide further reductions in the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules and lead to further pricing pressure for solar modules and potentially the oversupply of solar modules 

  

during any such period our competitors could decide to reduce their sales prices in response to competition even below their manufacturing costs in order to generate sales other competitors may have direct or indirect access to sovereign capital which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time as a result we may be unable to sell our solar modules at attractive prices or for a profit during any period of excess supply of solar modules which would reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations also we may decide to lower our average selling price to certain customers in certain markets in response to competition 

thinfilm solar technology has a limited field history as a result and despite our efforts our solar modules and systems may perform below expectations problems with product quality or performance may cause us to incur significant andor unexpected warranty and related expenses damage our market reputation and prevent us from maintaining or increasing our market share 

researchers began developing thinfilm semiconductor technology over 25 years ago but were unable to integrate the technology into a practical industrial scale solar module production line until about a decade ago we perform a variety of quality and life tests under different conditions upon which we base our assessments and warranty of product performance over its expected useful life however if our thinfilm technology and solar modules perform below expectations we could lose customers and face substantial warranty expense 

we provide a limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for 10 years following delivery to the owners of our solar modules we also typically warrant to our owners that solar modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 90 of their labeled power output rating during the first 10 years following their installation and at least 80 of their labeled power output rating during the following 15 years as a result we bear the risk of extensive warranty claims long after we have sold our solar modules and recognized net sales as an alternative to our module power output warranty we have offered a system level module performance warranty for a limited number of our recent sales as of december 31 2013  our accrued warranty liability was 1980 million  of which 671 million  was classified as current and 1309 million  was classified as noncurrent in 2013 we announced to our customers the avalibility of a new linear power output warranty for modules shipped beginning in the second quarter of 2014 

 we have historically estimated our product warranty liability for power output and defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions to have an estimated warranty return rate of approximately 3 of modules covered under warranty a 1 change in the estimated warranty return rate would change our estimated product warranty liability by approximately 55 million  

  

during the period from june 2008 to june 2009 a manufacturing excursion occurred whereby certain modules manufactured during that time period may experience premature power loss once installed in the field we initiated a voluntary remediation program beyond our standard warranty pursuant to which we made commitments to customers with systems containing modules affected by the manufacturing excursion that we would cover certain costs of remediation efforts we have expensed 2712 million total todate for the estimated costs of remediating systems affected by modules manufactured during the relevant period 

if any of our assumptions used in estimating the above referenced warranty or manufacturing excursion costs prove incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses which could adversely impact our financial position operating results and cash flows although we have taken significant corrective actions to avoid a manufacturing excursion from occurring any future manufacturing excursions including any commitments made by us to take remediation actions in respect of affected modules beyond our limited warranty could adversely impact our financial position operating results and cash flows 

although our power output warranty extends for 25 years our oldest solar modules manufactured during the qualification of our pilot production line have only been in use since 2001 as a result our warranty is based on a variety of quality and life tests that enable predictions of durability and future performance these predictions however could prove to be materially different from the actual performance over the full life of our solar modules causing us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective solar modules in the future for example our glassonglass solar modules could suffer various failure modes including breakage delamination corrosion or experience power degradation in excess of expectations and our manufacturing operations or supply chain could be subject to process variations that could cause affected modules to fail or underperform compared to our expectations these risks could be amplified as we implement design and process changes in connection with our efforts to improve our product accelerate module conversion efficiency and manufacturing production throughput improvements as part of our long 

 27 

term strategic plan in addition as we increase the number of installations in extreme climates in accordance with our long term strategic plan we may experience increased failure rates due to deployment into such field conditions any widespread product failures may damage our market reputation cause our sales to decline require us to repair or replace the defective modules and cause us to take voluntary remedial measures beyond warranty terms to enhance customer satisfaction which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

in addition to our solar module warranty described above for solar power plants built by our systems business we typically provide a limited warranty on the balance of the system against defects in engineering design installation and workmanship for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a phase or the entire solar power plant failures of solar power plants built by us could result in significant increases to warranty expense damage our market reputation cause our sales to decline cause us to incur unexpected costs to remedy defects or otherwise negatively affect our results of operations 

in addition as part of our systems business we conduct performance testing of the solar power plant prior to substantial completion to confirm the power plant meets operational and capacity expectations noted in the epc agreement in addition we may provide an energy generation performance test during the first year of the solar power plant’s operation such a test is designed to demonstrate that the actual energy generation for the first year meets or exceeds the modeled energy expectation after certain adjustments and exclusions if there is an underperformance event determined at the end of the first year after substantial completion we may incur liquidated damages as a percentage of the epc contract price in limited cases a similar energy generation test is offered as part of our operations and maintenance service up to a maximum of five years 

if our estimates regarding the future cost of collecting and recycling solar modules covered by our collection and recycling program are incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses at and from the time we realize our estimates are incorrect and face a significant unplanned cash burden 

prior to 2013 we have historically prefunded and may need to continue to prefund in certain jurisdictions our estimated future obligation for collecting and recycling solar modules covered by our collection and recycling program based on the present value of the expected future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules which includes estimates for the cost of packaging the solar modules for transport the cost of freight from the solar module installation sites to a recycling center the material labor capital costs and scale of recycling centers and an estimated thirdparty profit margin and return on risk for collection and recycling services we base our estimate on our experience collecting and recycling solar modules that do not pass our quality control tests and solar modules returned under our warranty and on our expectations about future developments in recycling technologies and processes and economic conditions at the time the solar modules are expected to be collected and recycled if our estimates prove incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses at and from the time we realize our estimates are incorrect and could also face a significant unplanned cash burden at the time we realize our estimates are incorrect or endusers return their solar modules which could harm our operating results in addition participating endusers can return their solar modules covered under the collection and recycling program at any time as a result we could be required to collect and recycle covered solar modules earlier than we expect 

our failure to further refine our technology reduce module manufacturing and bos costs and develop and introduce improved pv products could render our solar modules or systems uncompetitive and reduce our net sales profitability andor market share 

we need to continue to invest significant financial resources in research and development to continue to improve our module conversion efficiency lower the lcoe of our pv systems and otherwise keep pace with technological advances in the solar energy industry however research and development activities are inherently uncertain and we could encounter practical difficulties in commercializing our research results we seek to continuously improve our products and processes and the resulting changes carry potential risks in the form of delays additional costs or other unintended contingencies in addition our significant expenditures on research and development may not produce corresponding benefits other companies are developing a variety of competing pv technologies including advanced multicrystalline silicon cells high efficiency ntype crystalline silicon cells and copper indium gallium diselenide and amorphous silicon thin films which could produce solar modules or systems that prove more costeffective or have better performance than our solar modules or systems in addition other companies could potentially develop a highly reliable renewable energy system that mitigates the intermittent power production drawback of many renewable energy systems or offers other valueadded improvements from the perspective of utilities and other system owners in which case such companies could compete with us even if the lcoe associated with such new system is higher than that of our systems as a result our solar modules or systems may be negatively differentiated or rendered obsolete by the technological advances of our competitors which would reduce our net sales profitability andor market share 

 28 

in addition we often forward price our products and services in anticipation of future cost reductions and technology improvements and thus an inability to further refine our technology and execute our conversion efficiency roadmap and our longterm manufacturing cost bos cost and lcoe reduction objectives could adversely affect our margins and operating results 

our failure to protect our intellectual property rights may undermine our competitive position and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against third party allegations of infringement may be costly 

protection of our proprietary processes methods and other technology is critical to our business failure to protect and monitor the use of our existing intellectual property rights could result in the loss of valuable technologies we rely primarily on patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property we regularly file patent applications to protect inventions arising from our research and development and are currently pursuing such patent applications in various countries in accordance with our strategy for intellectual property in that jurisdiction our existing patents and future patents could be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents or if patents are issued to us such patents may not be sufficient to provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies 

we also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position although we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our associates and third parties to protect our intellectual property such confidentiality agreements are limited in duration and could be breached and may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary manufacturing expertise adequate remedies may not be available in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise in addition others may obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or legal means the failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes equipment technology trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise methods and compounds could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries especially any developing countries into which we may expand our operations in some countries we have not applied for patent trademark or copyright protection 

  

third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary technologies or other intellectual property rights which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology can be difficult and expensive also litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others we cannot assure you that the outcome of such potential litigation will be in our favor such litigation may be costly and may divert management attention and other resources away from our business an adverse determination in any such litigation may impair our intellectual property rights and may harm our business prospects and reputation in addition we have no insurance coverage against such litigation costs and would have to bear all costs arising from such litigation to the extent we are unable to recover them from other parties 

some of our key raw materials and components are either singlesourced or sourced from a limited number of third party suppliers and their failure to perform could cause manufacturing delays and impair our ability to deliver solar modules to customers in the required quality and quantities and at a price that is profitable to us 

our failure to obtain raw materials and components that meet our quality quantity and cost requirements in a timely manner could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture our solar modules or increase our manufacturing cost some of our key raw materials and components are either singlesourced or sourced from a limited number of third party suppliers as a result the failure of any of our suppliers to perform could disrupt our supply chain and impair our operations in addition some of our suppliers are small companies that may be unable to supply our increasing demand for raw materials and components as we continue to expand rapidly we may be unable to identify new suppliers or qualify their products for use on our production lines in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms a constraint on our production may cause us to be unable to meet our capacity ramp plan andor our obligations under our customer contracts which would have an adverse impact on our financial results 

a disruption in our supply chain for cadmium telluride our semiconductor material could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture solar modules and could adversely impact our profitability and longterm growth prospects 

a key raw material we use in our production process is a cadmium telluride compound tellurium one of the main components of cadmium telluride is mainly produced as a byproduct of copper refining and therefore its supply is largely dependent upon demand for copper our supply of cadmium telluride could be limited if any of our current suppliers or any of our future suppliers are unable to acquire an adequate supply of tellurium in a timely manner or at commercially reasonable prices if our competitors begin to use or increase their demand for cadmium telluride supply could be reduced and prices could increase if our current suppliers or any of our future suppliers cannot obtain sufficient tellurium they could substantially increase prices or be unable to 

 29 

perform under their contracts we may be unable to pass increases in the cost of our raw materials through to our customers a substantial increase in tellurium prices could adversely impact our profitability and longterm growth objectives 

  

our tetrasun module offering may not be able to achieve profitable commercial scale which could adversely impact our operating results and our future growth strategy with respect to pv solar in restricted spaces 

in 2013 we acquired tetrasun inc a development stage company with high efficiency crystalline silicon technology we expect our highpower density tetrasun modules to offer advantages relative to our cdte modules in commercial  industrial rooftop and other space constrained applications although we expect to begin manufacturing tetrasun modules in limited quantities by the end of 2014 we are not experienced with crystalline silicon module manufacturing compared to many of our competitors and accordingly we face numerous risks and uncertainties many of these risks are inherent in pv module manufacturing generally or otherwise similar to risks involved in our cdte pv module manufacturing operations and are discussed elsewhere in item 1a “risk factors” 

additionally scaling of highvolume tetrasun module manufacturing could present supply chain timing and other challenges contrasted with our largely automated cdte manufacturing lines our tetrasun module manufacturing operations will involve a batch process and will not be fullyintegrated from initial feedstock to final module potentially resulting in timing cost supply and other constraints we will be outsourcing module assembly to a third party and any constraints such party faces in meeting our volume or quality requirements would negatively impact our ability to deliver modules to our customers tetrasun cells will be manufactured using ntype monocrystalline wafers we currently do not have polysilicon contracts in place and will rely on our wafer suppliers to contract feedstock in sufficient volumes to meet our demand marketdriven increases in polysilicon prices realized by our wafer suppliers or increases in wafer prices generally would increase first solars manufacturing costs and negatively impact margins on tetrasun modules 

if we are able to achieve highvolume manufacturing of tetrasun modules we may not have an adequate sales channel for such modules andor the prevailing average selling price or conversion efficiency of pv modules in general may have changed in such a manner as to make our tetrasun modules uncompetitive if our tetrasun modules are unable to achieve profitable commercial scale we may have to write down all or a portion of the assets related to this business area and our future growth strategy with respect to pv solar in restricted spaces could be adversely impacted which outcomes could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

our future success depends on our ability to effectively balance manufacturing production with market demand and when necessary continue to build new manufacturing plants over time in response to such demand and add production lines in a costeffective manner all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties 

our future success depends on our ability to effectively balance manufacturing production with market demand and increase both our manufacturing capacity and production throughput over time in a costeffective and efficient manner if we cannot do so we may be unable to expand our business decrease our manufacturing cost per watt maintain our competitive position satisfy our contractual obligations or sustain profitability see “an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may continue to cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations” our ability to expand production capacity is subject to significant risks and uncertainties including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  30 

 

 

if any future production lines that we may build in the future are not built in line with our committed schedules it may impair any future growth plans if any future production lines do not achieve operating metrics similar to our existing production lines our solar modules could perform below expectations and cause us to lose customers 

if we are unable to systematically replicate our production lines as necessary over time and achieve and sustain similar operating metrics in our future production lines as we have achieved at our existing production lines our manufacturing capacity could be substantially constrained our manufacturing costs per watt could increase and this may impair our growth plans andor cause us to lose customers resulting in lower net sales higher liabilities and lower net income than we anticipate for instance future production lines could produce solar modules that have lower conversion efficiencies higher failure rates and higher rates of degradation than solar modules from our existing production lines and we could be unable to determine the cause of the lower operating metrics or develop and implement solutions to improve performance 

some of our manufacturing equipment is customized and sole sourced if our manufacturing equipment fails or if our equipment suppliers fail to perform under their contracts we could experience production disruptions and be unable to satisfy our contractual requirements 

some of our manufacturing equipment is customized to our production lines based on designs or specifications that we provide to the equipment manufacturer which then undertakes a specialized process to manufacture the custom equipment as a result the equipment is not readily available from multiple vendors and would be difficult to repair or replace if it were to become damaged or stop working if any piece of equipment fails production along the entire production line could be interrupted in addition the failure of our equipment suppliers to supply equipment in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms could delay our expansion plans and otherwise disrupt our production schedule or increase our manufacturing costs all of which would adversely impact our financial results 

if we are unable to further increase the number of sellable watts per solar module and reduce our manufacturing cost per watt our profitability could decline 

our profitability could decline if we are unable to continue to reduce our manufacturing cost per watt furthermore our failure to reduce cost per watt by increasing our efficiency may impair our ability to enter new markets that we believe will require lower cost per watt for us to be competitive and may impair our growth plans 

we may be unable to manage the expansion of our operations effectively 

we expect to continue to expand our business in order to provide utilityscale pv generation to existing and new geographic markets and to maintain or increase market share to manage the continued expansion of our operations we will be required to continue to improve our operational and financial systems procedures and controls and expand train manage and retain our growing associate base our management will also be required to maintain and expand our relationships with customers suppliers and other third parties and attract new customers and suppliers in addition our current and planned operations personnel systems and internal controls and procedures might be inadequate to support our future growth the effectiveness of our controls and procedures could be adversely impacted as we transfer more business functions to lower cost geographies as part of our cost reduction initiatives if we cannot manage our growth effectively we may be unable to take advantage of market opportunities execute our business strategies or respond to competitive pressures 

our substantial international operations subject us to a number of risks including unfavorable political regulatory labor and tax conditions in foreign countries 

we have significant marketing distribution and manufacturing operations both within and outside the united states we expect to continue to expand our operations worldwide as a result we will be subject to the legal political social tax and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions risks inherent to international operations include but are not limited to the following 

  31 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

our business in foreign markets requires us to respond to rapid changes in market conditions in these countries our overall success as a global business depends in part on our ability to succeed in differing legal regulatory economic social and political conditions we may not be able to develop and implement policies and strategies that will be effective in each location where we do business 

risks related to our systems business 

project development or construction activities may not be successful and projects under development may not receive required permits real property rights power purchase agreements “ppas” interconnection and transmission arrangements or financing or construction may not commence or proceed as scheduled which could increase our costs and impair our ability to recover our investments 

the development and construction of solar power electric generation facilities and other energy infrastructure projects involve numerous risks we may be required to spend significant sums for land and interconnection rights preliminary engineering permitting legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built success in developing a particular project is contingent upon among other things 

 32 

 

 

 

 

negotiation of satisfactory engineering procurement and construction agreements 

 

 

 

 

 

 

successful completion of a particular project may be adversely affected delayed andor rendered infeasible by numerous factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 33 

 

 

if we are unable to complete the development of a solar power facility we fail to meet one or more agreed target construction milestone dates any agreed upon systemlevel capacity or energy output guarantees or warranties including for some projects twentyfive year energy performance or systemlevel module degradation warranties or other contract terms or our projects cause grid interference or other damage we may be subject to forfeiture of significant deposits under power purchase agreements or interconnection agreements or termination of such agreements significant liquidated damages penalties andor other obligations under the epc agreement or other agreements relating to the project including obligations to repair replace andor supplement additional modules and balance of system materials for the project particularly if our liabilities are not capped under the terms of such agreement and we typically will not be able to recover our investment in the project some of these penalties might require us to repurchase the project from the buyer or to downsize the project under certain circumstances if we were required to repurchase a project we may have insufficient cash or capital resources necessary to make the repurchase payment or we may be unable to resell the project in a timely manner or on terms commercially satisfactory to us which would adversely impact our results of operations some of these investments are included as assets on our consolidated balance sheet under the line item “project assets” if we are unable to complete the development of a solar power project we may writedown or writeoff some or all of these capitalized investments which would have an adverse impact on our net income in the period in which the loss is recognized in 2014 we expect to invest a significant amount of capital to develop projects owned by us or third parties which may limit the availability of capital to use for other purposes such as contract damages or repurchase payments 

we may enter into fixedprice epc contracts in which we act as the general contractor for our customers in connection with the installation of their solar power systems all essential costs are estimated at the time of entering into the epc contract for a particular project and these are reflected in the overall fixedprice that we charge our customers for the project these cost estimates are preliminary and may or may not be covered by contracts between us or the subcontractors suppliers and other parties to the project in addition we require qualified licensed subcontractors to install most of our systems shortages of such skilled labor could significantly delay a project or otherwise increase our costs should miscalculations in planning a project occur including those due to unexpected increases in inflation commodity prices or labor costs or delays in execution occur and we are unable to increase commensurately the epc sales price we may not achieve our expected margins or we may be required to record a loss in the relevant fiscal period 

we may be unable to acquire or lease land obtain necessary interconnection and transmission rights andor obtain the approvals licenses permits and electric transmission grid interconnection and transmission rights necessary to build and operate pv power plants in a timely and cost effective manner and regulatory agencies local communities labor unions or other third parties may delay prevent or increase the cost of construction and operation of the pv plants we intend to build 

in order to construct and operate our pv plants we need to acquire or lease land and rights of way obtain interconnection rights and obtain all necessary local county state federal and foreign approvals licenses and permits as well as rights to interconnect the plants to the transmission grid and transmit energy generated from the plant we may be unable to acquire the land or lease interests needed may not obtain satisfactory interconnection rights may not receive or retain the requisite approvals permits licenses and interconnection and transmission rights or may encounter other problems which could delay or prevent us from successfully constructing and operating pv plants 

  

many of our proposed pv plants are located on or require access through public lands administered by federal and state agencies pursuant to competitive public leasing and rightofway procedures and processes the authorization for the use construction and operation of pv plants and associated transmission facilities on federal state and private lands will also require the assessment and evaluation of mineral rights private rightsofway and other easements environmental agricultural cultural recreational and aesthetic impacts and the likely mitigation of adverse impacts to these and other resources and uses the inability to obtain the required permits and potentially excessive delay in obtaining such permits due for example to litigation or third party appeals could prevent us from successfully constructing and operating pv plants in a timely manner and could result in a potential forfeiture of any deposit we have made with respect to a given project moreover project approvals subject to project modifications and conditions including mitigation requirements and costs could affect the financial success of a given project 

in addition local labor unions may increase the cost of andor lower the productivity of project development in california and elsewhere we may also be subject to labor unavailability andor increased union labor requirements due to multiple simultaneous projects in a geographic region 

lack of transmission capacity availability potential upgrade costs to the transmission grid and other systems constraints could significantly impact our ability to build pv plants and generate solar electricity power sales 

 34 

  

in order to deliver electricity from our pv plants to our customers our projects generally need to connect to the transmission grid the lack of available capacity on the transmission grid could substantially impact our projects and cause reductions in project size delays in project implementation increases in costs from transmission upgrades and potential forfeitures of any deposit we have made with respect to a given project these transmission issues as well as issues relating to the availability of large systems such as transformers and switch gear could significantly impact our ability to build pv plants and generate solar electricity sales 

  

our systems business is largely dependent on us and third parties arranging financing from various sources which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms or in insufficient amounts 

  

the construction of the large utilityscale solar power projects under development by us is expected in many cases to require project financing including nonrecourse project debt financing in the bank loan market and institutional debt capital markets uncertainties exist as to whether our projects will be able to access the debt markets in a magnitude sufficient to finance their construction if we are unable to arrange such financing or if it is only available on unfavorable terms we may be unable to fully execute our systems business plan in addition we generally expect to sell our projects by raising project equity capital from tax oriented strategic industry and other equity investors such equity sources may not be available or may only be available in insufficient amounts in which case our ability to sell our projects may be delayed or limited and our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected even if such financing sources are available the counterparty to many of our fixedprice epc contracts which own the project we are constructing are often special purpose vehicles that do not have significant assets other than their interests in the project and have pledged all or substantially all of these assets to secure the projectrelated debt and certain other sources of financing if the owner defaults on its payment or other obligations to us we may face difficulties in collecting payment of amounts due to us for the costs previously incurred or for the amounts previously expended or committed to be expended to purchase equipment or supplies including intercompany purchases of pv modules or for termination payments we are entitled to under the terms of the related epc contract if we are unable to collect the amounts owed to us or are unable to complete the project because of an owner default we may be required to record a charge against earnings related to the project which could result in a material loss 

  

in addition for projects to which we provide epc services but are not the project developer our epc activities are in many cases dependent on the ability of third parties to finance their pv plant projects which in turn is dependent on their ability to obtain financing for such purchases on acceptable terms depending on prevailing conditions in the credit markets interest rates and other factors such financing may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms or in insufficient amounts if third parties are limited in their ability to access financing to support their purchase of pv power plant construction services from us we may not realize the cash flows that we expect from such sales and this could adversely affect our ability to invest in our business andor generate revenue see also the risk factor above entitled “an increase in interest rates or lending rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets including a reduction in total tax equity availability could make it difficult for endusers to finance the cost of a pv system and could reduce the demand for our solar modules andor lead to a reduction in the average selling price for pv modules  ” 

  

developing solar power projects may require significant upfront investment prior to the signing of an epc contract and commencing construction which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

our solar power project development cycles which span the time between the identification of land and the commercial operation of a pv power plant project vary substantially and can take many months or years to mature as a result of these long project cycles we may need to make significant upfront investments of resources including for example payments for land rights large transmission and ppa deposits or other payments which may be nonrefundable in advance of the signing of epc contracts and commencing construction and the receipt of any revenue much of which is not recognized for several additional months or years following contract signing our potential inability to enter into sales contracts with potential customers after making such upfront investments could adversely affect our business and results of operations furthermore we may become constrained in our ability to simultaneously fund our other business operations and these systems investments through our long project development cycles 

our liquidity may be adversely affected to the extent the project sale market weakens and we are unable to sell our solar projects on pricing terms and timing commercially acceptable to us in such a scenario we may choose to continue to own and operate certain solar power plants for a period of time after which the project assets may be sold to third parties in such cases the delayed disposition of projects could require us to recognize a gain on the sale of assets instead of recognizing revenue 

we may not be able to obtain longterm contracts for the sale of power produced by our projects at prices and on other terms favorable to attract financing and other investments 

 35 

obtaining longterm contracts for the sale of power produced by the projects at prices and on other terms favorable to us is essential for obtaining financing and commencing construction of our projects we must compete for power purchase agreements against other developers of solar and renewable energy projects further other sources of power such as natural gasfired power plants have historically been cheaper than the cost of solar power and power from certain types of projects such as natural gasfired power plants can be delivered on a firm basis the inability to compete successfully against other power producers or otherwise enter into ppas favorable to us would negatively affect our ability to develop and finance our projects and negatively impact our revenue in addition the availability of power purchase agreements is a function of a number of economic regulatory tax and public policy factors in addition certain of our projects may be scheduled for substantial completion prior to the commencement of a longterm ppa with a major offtaker in which case we would be required to enter into a stubperiod ppa for the intervening time period or sell down the project we may not be able to do either on terms that are commercially attractive to us 

we may be subject to unforeseen costs liabilities or obligations when providing om services 

we may provide ongoing om services to system owners under fixedprice longterm service agreements pursuant to which we generally perform all scheduled and unscheduled maintenance for the system perform operating and other asset management services for the system and provide an availability guarantee for the system our costs to perform these services are estimated at the time of entering into the om agreement for a particular project and these are reflected in the fixedprice that we charge our customers under the om agreement we do not have extensive experience in performing om services for pv solar power plants and estimating actual costs to serve under our om agreements relative to the price that we charge our customers particularly in foreign jurisdictions in which we plan to offer pv systems solutions as part of our long term strategic plan should miscalculations in estimating these costs occur including those due to unexpected increases in inflation or labor or bos costs our growth strategy and results of operations could be adversely affected because of the longterm nature of these om agreements the adverse impacts on results of operations could be significant particularly if our liabilities are not capped or subject to an abovemarket liability cap under the terms of the om agreement we also could be subject to substantial costs liabilities or obligations in the event our solar systems do not meet any agreedupon systemlevel availability or performance warranties 

our systems business is subject to regulatory oversight and liability if we fail to operate our solar systems in compliance with electric reliability rules 

the ongoing om services that we provide for system owners may subject us to regulation by the north american electric reliability corporation “nerc” or its designated regional representative as a “generator operator” or “gop” under electric reliability rules filed with ferc our failure to comply with the reliability rules applicable to gops could subject us to substantial fines by nerc subject to ferc’s review in addition the system owners that receive our om services may be regulated by nerc as “generator owners” or “gos” and we may incur liability for go violations and fines levied by nerc subject to ferc’s review based on the terms of our om agreements finally as a systems owner and operator we may in the future be subject to regulation by nerc as a go 

other risks 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions and integration of these acquisitions may disrupt our business and management 

we have made several acquisitions in the last several years and in the future we may acquire additional companies project pipelines products or technologies or enter into joint ventures or other strategic initiatives we may not realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition and each acquisition has numerous risks these risks include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 36 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mergers and acquisitions of companies are inherently risky and ultimately if we do not complete the integration of acquired businesses successfully and in a timely manner we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions to the extent anticipated which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our future success depends on our ability to retain our key associates and to successfully integrate them into our management team 

we are dependent on the services of our executive officers and other members of our senior management team the loss of one or more of these key associates or any other member of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on us we may not be able to retain or replace these key associates and we may not have adequate succession plans in place several of our current key associates including our executive officers are subject to employment conditions or arrangements that contain postemployment noncompetition provisions however these arrangements permit the associates to terminate their employment with us upon little or no notice and the enforceability of the noncompetition provisions in certain jurisdictions is uncertain 

if we are unable to attract train and retain key personnel our business may be materially and adversely affected 

our future success depends to a significant extent on our ability to attract train and retain management operations sales training and technical personnel including in foreign jurisdictions as we continue to execute on our long term strategic plan recruiting and retaining capable personnel particularly those with expertise in the pv industry and thinfilm technology are vital to our success there is substantial competition for qualified technical personnel and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain our technical personnel if we are unable to attract and retain qualified associates or otherwise experience labor disruptions our business may be materially and adversely affected 

certain types of services provided by onsite workers at certain of our solar projects under construction are subject to the davisbacon act the davisbacon act requires that a contractor pay all personnel assigned to the contract at least the prevailing wage and fringe benefits as established by and in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the us department of labor “dol” we have an established policy pursuant to which we evaluate davisbacon act requirements and ensure our compliance with these requirements if the dol were to ultimately determine that anyone working under such contracts were not properly classified or were being paid the incorrect prevailing wage we could incur additional liability with respect to such workers for example the agua caliente project we are constructing is currently undergoing a dol davisbacon act compliance review for which the ultimate outcome is uncertain any such liability incurred above our anticipated costs for these services could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we may be exposed to infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties which if determined adversely to us could cause us to pay significant damage awards or prohibit us from the manufacture and sale of our solar modules or the use of our technology 

 37 

our success depends largely on our ability to use and develop our technology and knowhow without infringing or misappropriating the intellectual property rights of third parties the validity and scope of claims relating to pv technology patents involve complex scientific legal and factual considerations and analysis and therefore may be highly uncertain we may be subject to litigation involving claims of patent infringement or violation of intellectual property rights of third parties the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits patent opposition proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings can be both costly and time consuming and may significantly divert the efforts and resources of our technical and management personnel an adverse determination in any such litigation or proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liability to third parties require us to seek licenses from third parties which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all or pay ongoing royalties require us to redesign our solar module or subject us to injunctions prohibiting the manufacture and sale of our solar modules or the use of our technologies protracted litigation could also result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of our solar modules until the resolution of such litigation 

currency translation and transaction risk may negatively affect our net sales cost of sales and gross margins and could result in exchange losses 

although our reporting currency is the us dollar we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most countries in which we operate as a result we are subject to currency translation and transaction risk for example 6  and 4  of our net sales were denominated in euros for the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively and we expect more than a minor percentage of our net sales to be outside the united states and denominated in foreign currencies in the future in addition our operating expenses for our manufacturing plants located outside the us and our operations for our systems business in foreign countries will generally be denominated in the local currency joint ventures or other business arrangements with strategic partners outside of the united states have and are expected in the future to involve significant investments denominated in the local currency changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar could affect our net sales cost of sales and equity investments and could result in exchange gains or losses we cannot accurately predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations 

we could also expand our business into emerging markets many of which have an uncertain regulatory environment relating to currency policy conducting business in such emerging markets could cause our exposure to changes in exchange rates to increase due to the relatively high volatility associated with emerging market currencies and potentially longer payment terms for our proceeds 

our ability to hedge foreign currency exposure is dependent on our credit profile with the banks that are willing and able to do business with us deterioration in our credit position or a significant tightening of the credit market conditions could limit our ability to hedge our foreign currency exposure and therefore result in exchange gains or losses 

global sovereign debt issues could adversely impact our business 

potential sovereign debt issues in europe emerging markets and other regions and their impact on the balance sheets and lending practices of global banks in particular could negatively impact our access to and cost of capital and therefore could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and competitive position it could also similarly affect our customers and therefore limit the sales of our modules and demand for our systems business as well sovereign debt problems may also cause governments to reduce eliminate or allow to expire government subsidies and economic incentives for solar energy which could limit our growth or cause our net sales to decline and materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to litigation risks including securities class actions and stockholder derivative actions which may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain 

from time to time we are subject to legal claims with and without merit that may be costly and which may divert the attention of our management and our resources in general in addition our projects may be subject to litigation or other adverse proceedings that may adversely impact our ability to proceed with construction or sell a given project which would adversely affect our ability to recognize revenue with respect to such project the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict moreover many of the complaints filed against us do not specify the amount of damages that plaintiffs seek and we therefore are unable to estimate the possible range of damages that might be incurred should these lawsuits be resolved against us certain of these lawsuits assert types of claims that if resolved against us could give rise to substantial damages and an unfavorable outcome or settlement of one or more of these lawsuits or any future lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations even if these lawsuits or any future lawsuits are not resolved against us the costs of defending such lawsuits may be costly and may not be covered by our insurance policies because the price of our common stock has been and 

 38 

may continue to be volatile we can provide no assurance that additional securities litigation will not be filed against us in the future for more information on our legal proceedings including our securities class action and derivative actions see item 3 “legal proceedings” and note 15 “commitments and contingencies  legal proceedings” to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2013 included in this annual report on form 10k 

our largest stockholder has significant control over us and its interests may conflict with or differ from interests of other stockholders 

our largest stockholder consisting collectively of jcl fslr holdings llc and its beneficiaries and jtw trust no 1 uad 91902 and its beneficiaries each affiliated in the past with the former estate of john t walton collectively the “significant stockholder” owned approximately 27  of our outstanding common stock at december 31 2013  as a result the significant stockholder has substantial influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of our directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions such as mergers tender offers and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets the interests of the significant stockholder could conflict with or differ from interests of other stockholders for example the concentration of ownership held by the significant stockholder could delay defer or prevent a change of control of our company or impede a merger takeover or other business combination which a majority of stockholders may view favorably 

if our goodwill and other intangible assets or project assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 

we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements should we determine that our goodwill other intangible assets ie in process research and development “iprd” or project assets are impaired such a charge might have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations for example during the fourth quarter of 2011 we recorded goodwill impairment expense of 3934 million  related to our components reporting unit as discussed further in note 6 “goodwill and intangible assets”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2013  included in this annual report on form 10k 

  

as required by accounting rules we review our goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill is less than its carrying value factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill might not be recoverable include a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant decline in projections of future cash flows and lower future growth rates in our industry 

we review iprd for impairment on a quarterly basis to determine if the project has been abandoned if the project has been determined to be abandoned or not recoverable we would be required to impair the respective iprd project we review project assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable we consider a project commercially viable and recoverable if it is anticipated to be sellable for a profit once it is either fully developed or fully constructed if our projects are not considered commercially viable we would be required to impair the respective project assets 

unanticipated changes in our tax provisions the adoption of a new us tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge for inventory services licenses funding and other items in intercompany transactions we are subject to potential tax examinations in these various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges crossjurisdictional transfer pricing or other tax positions and assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these examinations in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these potential examinations and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of examinations could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows in addition our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure loss of our malaysian tax holiday changes in the mix of earnings in countries with tax holidays or differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process in addition recently announced proposals for new us tax legislation could have a material effect on the results of our operations if enacted 

our credit agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business 

 39 

we may be unable to respond to changes in business and economic conditions engage in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us and obtain additional financing if needed because our revolving credit facility and our malaysian facility agreements contain and any of our other future debt agreements may contain covenant restrictions that limit our ability to among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

under our revolving credit facility and our malaysian facility agreements we are also subject to certain financial covenants our ability to comply with covenants under our credit agreements is dependent on our future performance which will be subject to many factors some of which are beyond our control including prevailing economic conditions in addition our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under these agreements and any of our other future debt agreements which if not cured or waived could permit the holders thereof to accelerate such debt and could cause crossdefaults under our other facility agreements and the possible acceleration of debt under such other facility agreements as well as crossdefaults under certain of our key project and operational agreements in addition we cannot assure you that events that occur within the company or in the industry or the economy as a whole will not constitute material adverse effects under these agreements if it is determined that a material adverse effect has occurred the lenders can under certain circumstances restrict future borrowings or accelerate the due date of outstanding loan balances if any of our debt is accelerated we may in the future not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt and we may experience crossdefaults under our other debt agreements or project and key operational agreements which could materially and negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations

class action 

on march 15 2012 a purported class action lawsuit titled smilovits v first solar inc et al case no 212cv00555dgc was filed in the united states district court for the district of arizona hereafter “arizona district court” against the company and certain of our current and former directors and officers the complaint was filed on behalf of purchasers of the company’s securities between april 30 2008 and february 28 2012 the complaint generally alleges that the defendants violated sections 10b and 20a of the securities exchange act of 1934 by making false and misleading statements regarding the company’s financial performance and prospects the action includes claims for damages and an award of costs and expenses to the putative class including attorneys’ fees the company believes it has meritorious defenses and will vigorously defend this action 

on july 23 2012 the arizona district court issued an order appointing as lead plaintiffs in the class action the mineworkers’ pension scheme and british coal staff superannuation scheme collectively “pension schemes” the pension schemes filed an amended complaint on august 17 2012 which contains similar allegations and seeks similar relief as the original complaint defendants filed a motion to dismiss on september 14 2012 on december 17 2012 the court denied defendants’ motion to dismiss on february 26 2013 the court directed the parties to begin class certification discovery and ordered a further scheduling conference to set the merit discovery schedule after the issue of class certification has been decided on june 21 2013 the pension schemes filed a motion for class certification on october 8 2013 the arizona district court granted the pension schemes’ motion for class certification 

the securities class action is still in the early stages and merits discovery has only begun accordingly we are not in a position to assess whether any loss or adverse effect on our financial condition is probable or remote or to estimate the range of potential loss if any

unit of power 

when referring to our manufacturing capacity total sales and solar module sales the unit of electricity in watts for megawatts“mw” and gigawatts “gw” is direct current “dc” unless otherwise noted when referring to our pv solar power systems the unit of electricity in watts for mw and gw is alternating current “ac” unless otherwise noted 

overview 

we are a global provider of solar energy solutions focused on providing power solutions across key market segments we design manufacture and sell photovoltaic “pv” solar modules with an advanced thinfilm semiconductor technology and we develop design construct and sell pv solar power solutions that primarily use the solar modules we manufacture we are also developing crystalline silicon solar modules with proprietary highpower density monocrystalline technology and we provide singleaxis mounting systems with proprietary tracking capabilities additionally we provide operations and maintenance “om” services to plant owners that use solar modules manufactured by us or by other thirdparty manufacturers we have substantial ongoing research and development efforts focused on module and systems level innovations we are the world’s largest thinfilm pv solar module manufacturer and one of the world’s largest pv solar module manufacturers our mission is to create enduring value by enabling a world powered by clean affordable solar energy 

in addressing overall global demand for pv solar electricity we have developed a differentiated fully integrated systems business that can provide competitively priced utilityscale pv solutions for system owners and low cost solar electricity to endusers our fully integrated systems business has enabled us to drive cost reduction across the value chain identify and break constraints to sustainable markets and deliver compelling solutions to our customers and endusers with our fully integrated systems business we believe we are in a position to expand our business in economically sustainable markets in which support programs are minimal which are developing in areas that have a combination of abundant solar resources relatively high current electricity costs and sizable electricity demand we are committed to continually lowering the cost of solar electricity and in the longterm we plan to compete on an economic basis with conventional fossilfuelbased peaking power generation 

we believe that combining our vertical integration across the value chain enables us to be more competitive accelerate the adoption of our technology in solar power systems and identify and remove constraints to the successful migration to sustainable solar markets around the world our vertically integrated capabilities enable us to maximize value and mitigate risk for our customers and offer valuable benefits such as grid integration and stabilization thereby positioning us to deliver meaningful pv energy solutions to varied energy problems worldwide we seek to offer leadership across the entire solar value chain resulting in more reliable and cost effective pv energy solutions for our customers and furthering our mission to create enduring value by enabling a world powered by clean affordable solar electricity 

market overview 

the solar industry continues to be characterized by intense pricing competition both at the module and system level with many solar companies generating operating losses or little to no operating income in the aggregate manufacturers of solar modules and cells have installed production capacity that exceeds global demand we believe the solar industry will continue to experience periods of structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity exceeds global demand and that such periods will put pressure on pricing in light of such market realities we continue to execute our long term strategic plan described below under which we are focusing on our competitive strengths a key core strength is our differentiated vertically integrated business model that enables us to provide utilityscale pv generation solutions to sustainable geographic markets that have an immediate need for massscale pv electricity

solar markets worldwide continue to develop in part aided by demand elasticity resulting from declining industry average selling prices both at the module and system level which make solar power more affordable to new markets and we have continued to develop our localized presence and expertise in these markets for example in november 2013 we announced that construction had started on our 14 mw dc solar project in kitakyushushi japan utilizing our cdte thinfilm pv modules in november 2013 we also announced that we entered into an agreement with jx nippon oil  energy corporation for the distribution in japan through april 2015 of first solar high efficiency crystalline silicon modules expected to be manufactured beginning in 2014 in january 2014 we announced that we had started construction on australia’s largest utilityscale solar project the 102 mw nyngan solar project in new south wales 

  

in north america we continue to execute on our advancedstage utilityscale project pipeline we continue to make construction progress on what are currently or will be among the world’s largest pv solar power systems we expect a substantial portion of our consolidated net sales operating income and cash flows through the end of 2014 to be derived from these projects we continue to advance the development and selling efforts for the other projects included in our advancedstage utilityscale project pipeline and we continue to develop our earlytomid stage project pipeline and evaluate acquisitions of projects to continue to add to our advancedstage utilityscale project pipeline in october 2013 we announced that we had agreed to sell the 250 mw ac silver state south solar project to a subsidiary of nextera energy resources first solar will provide epc services for the project which is adjacent to the 50 mw silver state north project that was developed and built by first solar and commissioned in 2012 in november 2013 we announced that we signed power purchase agreements with member cities of the southern california public power authority scppa for electricity to be generated at the 40 mw pv solar power plant that we are developing and will construct in kern county california in january 2014 we announced that we had started construction on phase i of the barilla solar project in pecos county texas first solar will build commission and operate the 22 mw power plant and expects to offer the output to customers including municipal utilities and electric cooperatives 

we believe industry module average selling prices have begun to show signs of stabilization in several markets after a long period of significant decline across multiple markets lower industry module pricing while currently challenging for solar manufacturers particularly manufacturers with high cost structures is expected to continue to contribute to global market diversification and volume elasticity over time declining average selling prices are consistent with the erosion of one of the primary historical constraints to widespread solar market penetration its affordability in the near term however in light of industrywide manufacturing capacity that exceeds demand it is unclear whether growing worldwide demand could absorb industrywide module supply without further inventory buildup andor price reductions which could adversely affect our results of operations if competitors reduce module pricing to levels below their cash manufacturing costs or are able to operate at negative or minimal operating margins for sustained periods of time our results of operations could be further adversely affected we continue to mitigate this uncertainty in part by executing on and building our advancestage utilityscale systems pipeline as a buffer against demand fluctuations accelerating our module efficiency improvement and bos cost reduction roadmaps to maintain and increase our competitiveness profitability and capital efficiency adjusting our production plans and capacity utilization to match our expected demand and continuing the development of worldwide geographic markets 

  

in the components business we continue to face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules and other types of solar modules and pv systems solar module manufacturers compete with one another in several product performance attributes including reliability and selling price per watt and with respect to solar power systems return on equity “roe” and lcoe meaning the net present value of total life cycle costs of the solar power project divided by the quantity of energy which is expected to be produced over the system’s life we are among the lowest cost pv module manufacturers in the solar industry on a module cost per watt basis based on publicly available information this cost competitiveness is reflected in the price at which we sell our modules and fully integrated pv solar power systems and enables our pv solar power systems to compete favorably in respect of their roe or lcoe our cost competitiveness is based in large part on our proprietary technology which enables conversion efficiency improvements and enables us to produce a module in less than 25 hours using a continuous and highly automated industrial manufacturing process as opposed to a batch process our scale and our operational excellence in addition our cdte modules use approximately 12 of the amount of the polysilicon that is used to manufacture traditional crystalline silicon solar modules the cost of polysilicon is a significant driver of the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules and the timing and rate of change in the cost of silicon feedstock and polysilicon could lead to changes in solar module pricing levels polysilicon costs had periods of decline over the past several years contributing to a decline in our manufacturing cost competitiveness over traditional crystalline silicon module manufacturers given the lower conversion efficiency of our modules compared to certain types of crystalline silicon modules there may be higher bos costs associated with systems using our modules thus to compete effectively on the basis of lcoe our modules need to maintain a certain cost advantage per watt compared to crystalline siliconbased modules with higher conversion efficiencies we continue to reduce bos costs associated with pv solar power systems using our modules we believe we can continue to reduce bos costs by improving module conversion efficiency leveraging volume procurement around standardized hardware platforms using innovative 

 48 

installation techniques and know how and accelerating installation times bos costs can represent a significant portion of the costs associated with the construction of a typical utilityscale pv solar power system 

while our modules and pv solar power systems are currently competitive in cost reliability and performance attributes there can be no guarantee such competitiveness will continue to exist in the future to the same extent or at all any declines in the competitiveness of our products could result in additional margin compression further declines in the average selling prices of our solar modules erosion in our market share for modules and pv solar power systems decreases in the rate of net sales growth andor declines in overall net sales we have taken and continue to take various actions to mitigate the potential impact resulting from competitive pressures including adjusting our pricing policies as necessary accelerating progress along our module efficiency improvement and bos cost reduction roadmaps and further focusing our research and development on increasing the conversion efficiency of our solar modules 

as we continue to expand our systems business into sustainable markets we can offer value beyond the solar module reduce our exposure to moduleonly competition provide differentiated product offerings to minimize the impact of solar module commoditization and provide comprehensive utilityscale pv solar power system solutions that significantly reduce solar electricity costs thus our systems business allows us to play a more active role than many of our competitors in managing the demand for our solar modules finally we continue to form and develop strong relationships with our customers and strategic partners around the world and continue to develop our range of product offerings including epc capabilities and om services in order to enhance the competitiveness of systems using our solar modules for example we have and expect in the future to form joint ventures or other business arrangements with project developers in certain strategic markets in order to provide our modules and potential systems business pv generation solutions to the projects developed by such ventures 

certain trends and uncertainties 

we believe that our continuing operations may be favorably or unfavorably impacted by the following trends and uncertainties that may affect our financial condition and results of operations see item 1a “risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of other risks that may affect our financial condition and results of operations 

long term strategic plan 

in executing our long term strategic plan “ltsp” we are focusing on providing solar pv generation solutions using our modules to sustainable geographic markets that we believe have a compelling need for massscale pv electricity including markets throughout the americas asia australia the middle east and africa as part of our ltsp we are focusing on opportunities in which our solar pv generation solutions will compete directly with fossil fuel offerings on an lcoe basis execution of the ltsp entails a reallocation of resources around the globe in particular dedicating resources to regions such as latin america asia the middle east and africa where we have not traditionally conducted significant business to date we are evaluating and managing closely the appropriate level of resources required as we transition into and penetrate these specific markets we have and intend to continue to dedicate significant capital and human resources to reduce the total installed cost of solar pv generation to optimize the design and logistics around our solar pv generation solutions and to ensure that our solutions integrate well into the overall electricity ecosystem of each specific market 

we expect that over time an increasing portion of our consolidated net sales operating income and cash flows will come from solar offerings in the sustainable markets described above as we execute on our ltsp the timing execution and financial impacts of our ltsp are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the risk factors we are focusing our resources in those markets and energy applications in which solar power can be a leastcost bestfit energy solution particularly in regions with high solar resources significant current or projected electricity demand andor relatively high existing electricity prices as part of these efforts we continue to expand resources globally including by appointing country heads and supporting professional sales and other staff in target sustainable markets accordingly we are shifting current costs and expect to incur additional costs over time as we establish a localized business presence in these regions 

joint ventures or other business arrangements with strategic partners are a key part of our ltsp and we have begun initiatives in several markets using such arrangements to expedite our penetration of those markets and establish relationships with potential customers and policymakers some of these business arrangements have and are expected in the future to involve significant investments or other allocations of capital on our part we are in the process of developing relationships with policymakers regulators and end customers in each of these markets with a view to creating markets for utility scale pv solar power systems we sell solar power solutions directly to end customers including independent power producers utilities retail electricity providers and commercial and industrial customers depending on the market opportunity our sales offerings range from module only sales to module sales with a range of development engineering procurement and construction services and solutions to full turnkey pv solar power system sales we expect these sales offerings to continue to evolve over time as we work with our customers to 

 49 

optimize how our pv solar generation solutions can best meet our customers’ energy and economic needs as described above under “item 1 business  offerings and capabilities” in addition to our utilityscale power plant offering we have an ac power block offering as well as fuel displacement commercial and industrial and offgrid and energy access offerings 

in order to create or maintain a market position in certain strategically targeted markets our offerings from time to time may need to be competitively priced at levels associated with minimal gross profit margins which may adversely affect our results of operations we expect the profitability associated with our various sales offerings to vary from one another over time and possibly vary from our internal longrange profitability expectations and targets depending on the market opportunity and the relative competitiveness of our offering compared with other energy solutions fossil fuel based or otherwise that are available to potential customers 

we expect to use our working capital the availability under our revolving credit facility or nonrecourse project financing to finance the construction of certain of our pv solar power systems if the sale of such systems prior to construction beginning does not meet our economic return expectations or we cannot sell under terms and conditions that are favorable to us from time to time we may temporarily own and operate certain pv solar systems with the intention to sell at a later date the ability to do so allows us to gain control of the sales process provide a lower risk profile to a future buyer of a pv solar system and improve our ability to drive higher eventual sale values as of february 2014 we own and operate one completed solar power plant we also currently own two additional solar power plants under construction that are delivering power to the grid we may also elect to construct andor retain ownership interests in a merchant power plant as we are doing with our barilla solar project currently under construction in west texas we continue to pursue strategic partnerships that open up new geographic markets and those that provide access to a lower cost of capital and optimize the value of our projects additionally our joint ventures and other business arrangements with strategic partners have and may in the future result in us temporarily retaining a minority or noncontrolling ownership interest in the underlying systems projects we develop supply modules to or construct potentially for a period of up to several years in each of the above mentioned examples we may retain such ownership interests in a consolidated andor unconsolidated separate entity 

construction of some of the world’s largest solar pv power systems 

we expect a substantial portion of our consolidated net sales operating income and cash flows through the end of 2014 to be derived from several large projects in north america including the following projects which are currently or will be among the world’s largest pv solar power systems the 550 mw topaz solar farm located in san luis obispo county california the 550 mw desert sunlight solar farm located west of blythe california the 230 mw avsr project located north of los angeles california the 139 mw campo verde project located in imperial county california the 250 mw moapa solar project located on the moapa river indian reservation in clark county northeast of las vegas nevada the 250 mw silver state south project located near primm in clark county nevada the 150 mw solar gen 2 project located in californias imperial valley and the 58 mw copper mountain solar 2 project part of the 150 mw copper mountain solar complex in boulder city nevada please see the tables under “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationssystems project pipeline” for additional information about these and other projects within our systems business advancedstage project pipeline construction progress of these projects is subject to risks and delays as described in “item 1a risk factors” and elsewhere in this report revenue recognition for these and other systems projects is in many cases not linear in nature due to the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria have been or are expected to be met and consequently period over period comparisons of results of operations may not be meaningful as we progress construction towards substantial completion of these pv power systems we may have a larger portion of our net sales operating income and cash flows come from future sales of solar offerings outside of north america pursuant to our ltsp described above north america however will continue to represent a meaningful portion of our net sales operating income and cash flows as a significant portion of our advancestage project pipeline excluding the projects above is also comprised of projects in north america 

systems project pipeline 

the following tables summarize as of february 25 2014  our approximately 38 gw  systems business advancedstage project pipeline as of december 31 2013  for the projects sold under contract in our advancedstage project pipeline of approximately 27 gw  we have recognized revenue with respect to the equivalent of approximately 14 gw  such mw equivalent amount refers to the ratio of revenue recognized for the projects sold under contract in our advancedstage project pipeline compared to total contracted revenue for such projects multiplied by the total mw for such projects the remaining revenue to be recognized subsequent to december 31 2013  for the projects sold under contract in our advancedstage project pipeline is expected to be approximately 41 billion  the substantial majority of such amount is expected to be recognized as revenue through the later of the substantial completion or project closing dates of the projects sold under contract the remaining revenue to be recognized does not have a direct correlation to expected remaining module shipments for such projects sold under contract as expected module shipments do not represent total systems revenues and do not consider the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria 

 50 

are met including timing of module installation the actual volume of modules installed in our projects sold under contract will be greater than the project size in mw ac as module volumes required for a project are based upon mw dc which will be greater than the mw ac size pursuant to a dcac ratio typically ranging from 12 to 14 such ratio varies across different projects due to various system design factors projects are removed from our advancedstage project pipeline tables below once we have completed construction and after all revenue has been recognized 

we continually seek to make additions to our advancestage project pipeline we are actively developing our early to midstage project pipeline in order to secure ppas and we are also pursuing opportunities to acquire advancestage projects which already have ppas in place from february 27 2013 through february 25 2014  we acquired 610 mw of advancestage projects and we expect to acquire additional advancestage projects when such acquisitions meet our strategic andor our return on investment requirements 

  

projects sold under contract 

includes uncompleted sold projects projects under sales contracts subject to conditions precedent and epc agreements including partner developed projects that we will be or are constructing 



projects with executed ppa  not sold not contracted

key 

 

ge solar technology purchase and strategic commercial relationship 

in august 2013 we acquired all of the cdte pv specific intellectual property assets and cdte manufacturing processes of general electric company “ge” pursuant to certain transaction and purchase agreements in exchange for 175 million shares of first solar common stock the purchase of such intellectual property has advanced our solar module efficiency roadmap and is expected to reduce the lcoe of pv solar power systems that incorporate our modules in addition to the purchase of such intellectual property our research and development associates collaborate with ge global research center on knowledge transfer and future technology development to further advance cdte solar technology and module efficiencies pursuant to an agreement through 2014 ge also has the ability to purchase our modules with ge specific branding for future global ge deployments 

tetrasun acquisition 

in april 2013 we completed the acquisition of tetrasun inc “tetrasun” a company with a novel highefficiency crystalline silicon cell technology we believe that when the technology is successfully transitioned to commercial manufacturing scale the innovative cell architecture developed by tetrasun is capable of conversion efficiencies exceeding 21 percent with manufacturing costs comparable to conventional multicrystalline silicon solar modules we expect modules incorporating this technology to complement our current cdte module and systems offerings by allowing us to address markets in space constrained commercial and residential rooftop applications in such applications we expect our highefficiency modules based on the tetrasun technology to be competitively differentiated by enabling solar systems with high energy density in constrained spaces at competitive 

 52 

pricing we are currently targeting commencement of manufacturing by the end of 2014 we expect to market and sell such high efficiency modules using the first solar name or through cobranding with strategic partners 

restructuring and asset impairments 

we have undertaken a series of restructuring initiatives as further described in note 4 “restructuring and asset impairments”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2013  included in this annual report on form 10k in february 2012 and april 2012 respectively we announced material restructuring initiatives intended to i align the organization with our long term strategic plan including expected sustainable market opportunities ii accelerate operating cost reductions and improve overall operating efficiency and iii better align production capacity and geographic location of such capacity with expected geographic market requirements and demand 

such restructuring initiatives resulted in charges to restructuring expense of 52 million  in 2013 and 4691 million  in 2012 the most significant actions taken as part of these restructuring activities were the decisions to close our manufacturing operations comprised of 8lines of installed manufacturing capacity in frankfurt oder germany at the end of 2012 due to the lack of policy support for utilityscale solar projects in europe and to not proceed with our previously planned 4line manufacturing plant in vietnam and 2line manufacturing plant in france based upon expected future market demand and our focus on providing utilityscale pv generation solutions primarily to sustainable geographic markets 

in october 2013 we entered into an agreement to sell our facility in mesa arizona the facility consisted of land a building and certain fixtures and improvements the facility housed our om capabilities as well as certain equipment and inventory the facility was originally designed to house a cdte pv module manufacturing factory however we never commissioned manufacturing at the facility as a result of the sales agreement we have classified the mesa facility as “ assets held for sale ” in the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2013 and recognized a 565 million  asset impairment charge which lowered the book value of the facility to its fair value less costs to sell during the fourth quarter of 2013 we received cash proceeds net of costs to sell of approximately 115 million  in connection with the mesa sales agreement the transaction will be completed during the first quarter of 2014 

our vietnam facility was classified as an asset held for sale as of december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively during 2013 no reasonable offers to purchase the plant were obtained by us and as a result we were unable to sell the facility by the end of the oneyear period in addition during the fourth quarter of 2013 we adjusted our marketing strategy with regards to the plant and expect to expand the range of targeted buyers to include strategic as well as financial buyers to effectuate the disposition we will continue to actively market the facility at a price that is reasonable given the change in the targeted buyer group as a result of this change we determined that the estimated fair value of our vietnam plant and related equipment was less than its carrying value and we recorded an asset impairment charge of 252 million  to lower the carrying value of the facility to its estimated fair value less costs to sell 

financial operations overview 

the following describes certain line items in our statement of operations and some of the factors that affect our operating results 

net sales   

components business 

we generally price and sell our solar modules per watt of name plate power during 2013  a significant portion of net sales from the components business was related to modules included in our pv solar power systems described below under “net sales — systems business” other than the modules included in our pv solar power systems we sold the majority of our solar modules to pv solar power system project developers system integrators and operators headquartered in the united states germany and france which primarily integrate them into pv solar power systems that they own operate or construct 

  

from time to time we enter into module sales agreements with customers worldwide for specific projects or volumes of modules such agreements are generally not long term in nature during the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  48  and 10  respectively of our components business net sales excluding modules included in our pv solar power systems were denominated in euros and were subject to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and us dollar 

under our typical customer sales contracts for solar modules we transfer title and risk of loss to the customer and recognize revenue upon shipment pricing is typically fixed or determinable at the time of shipment and our customers do not typically have 

 53 

extended payment terms customers do not have rights of return under these contracts our revenue recognition policies for the components business are described further in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2013  included in this annual report on form 10k 

during 2013  aes  midamerican renewables llc  and nextera energy  individually accounted for more than 10 of our components segment’s net sales which includes the solar modules used in our systems projects 

systems business 

through our fully integrated systems business we provide a complete turnkey solar power system solution using our solar modules which may include project development epc services om services and project finance expertise 

net sales from our systems segment may include the following types of transactions 

 

 

 

 

net sales from our systems segment are impacted by numerous factors including the cost competitiveness of our systems offerings in comparison to our competitors’ solar power systems and other forms of electricity generation the magnitude and effectiveness of support programs and other solar power system demand drivers 

during 2013  2012  and 2011  the majority of our systems segment net sales were generated in north america 

during 2013  the principal customers of our systems segment were exelon corporation  general electric company  sumitomo corporation of america  midamerican renewables llc  and nextera energy  each of which also accounted for more than 10 of our systems segment sales during 2013  

revenue recognition — systems business  revenue recognition for our systems projects are in many cases not linear in nature due to the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria have been met and consequently period over period comparisons of results of operations may not be meaningful we typically use the percentageofcompletion method using actual costs incurred over total estimated costs to construct a project including module costs as our standard accounting policy but we only apply this method after all revenue recognition criteria have been met there are also many instances in which we recognize revenue only after a project has been completed primarily due to a project not being sold prior to completion or because all revenue recognition criteria are not met until the project is completed our revenue recognition policies for the systems business are described in further detail in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2013  included in this annual report on form 10k 

cost of sales   

components business 

our cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials and components for manufacturing solar modules such as glass transparent conductive coatings cadmium telluride and other thin film semiconductors laminate materials connector assemblies edge seal materials and other materials and components our cost of sales also includes direct labor for the manufacturing of solar modules and manufacturing overhead such as engineering equipment maintenance environmental health and safety quality and production control and procurement costs cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing plant and equipment and facilityrelated expenses in addition we record shipping warranty and the majority of our obligation for solar module collection and recycling costs within cost of sales 

 54 

our manufacturing cost per watt which is an operating metric we use as an indicator of manufacturing cost competitiveness represents the current manufacturing and associated costs incurred to produce and sell solar modules during a period divided by the number of sellable watts produced in the same period beginning in 2013 our cost per watt excludes any costs associated with our manufacturing plants in frankfurt oder germany which closed manufacturing operations at the end of 2012 

overall we expect our cost per watt to decrease over the next several years due to an increase in watts per solar module through improved conversion efficiencies an increase in unit output per production line and ongoing reductions in variable and fixed costs this expected decrease in cost per watt would be partially offset during periods in which we underutilize manufacturing capacity 

systems business 

within our systems business projectrelated costs include standard epc costs consisting primarily of bos costs for inverters electrical and mounting hardware project management and engineering costs and engineering and construction labor costs site specific costs and development costs including transmission upgrade costs interconnection fees and permitting costs 

as further described in note 23 “segment and geographical information”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2013  included within this annual report on form 10k at the time when all revenue recognition criteria are met we include the sale of our solar modules manufactured by our components business and used by our systems business within net sales of our components business therefore the related cost of sales are also included within our components business at that time the cost of solar modules is comprised of the manufactured inventory cost incurred by our components segment 

gross profit   

gross profit  is affected by numerous factors including our module and system average selling prices market mix our manufacturing costs bos costs project development costs the effective utilization of our production capacity and facilities and foreign exchange rates gross profit  is also affected by the mix of net sales generated by our components and systems businesses gross profit  for our systems business excludes the sales and cost of sales for solar modules used in our systems projects which we include in the gross profit of our components business 

research and development   

research and development  expense consists primarily of salaries and personnelrelated costs the cost of products materials and outside services used in our process and product research and development activities for both the components and systems businesses and depreciation and amortization expense associated with research and development specific facilities and intangible assets we acquire equipment for general use in our process and product development and record the depreciation of this equipment as research and development expense currently the substantial majority of our research and development expenses are attributable to our components segment 

we maintain a number of programs and activities to improve our technology and processes in order to enhance the performance and reduce the costs of our solar modules and pv solar power systems using our modules 

selling general and administrative   

selling general and administrative  expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated costs professional fees insurance costs travel expenses and other business development and selling expenses we expect selling general and administrative expense to decline over time as we reduce costs in connection with our ltsp 

  

our systems business has certain of its own dedicated administrative key functions such as accounting legal finance project finance human resources procurement and marketing costs for these functions are recorded and included within selling general and administrative costs for our systems segment our corporate key functions consist primarily of companywide corporate tax corporate treasury corporate accountingfinance corporate legal investor relations corporate communications and government relations and executive management functions these corporate functions and the assets supporting such functions benefit both the components and systems segments we allocate corporate costs to the components and systems segments as part of selling general and administrative costs based upon the estimated benefits provided to each segment from these corporate functions we determine the estimated benefits provided to each segment for these corporate costs based upon a combination of the estimated time spent by corporate employees supporting each segment and the average relative selling general and administrative costs incurred by each segment before such corporate allocations 

 55 

production startup   

production startup  expense consists primarily of salaries and personnelrelated costs and the cost of operating a production line before it has been qualified for full production including the cost of raw materials for solar modules run through the production line during the qualification phase it also includes all expenses related to the selection of a new site and the related legal and regulatory costs and the costs to maintain our plant replication program to the extent we cannot capitalize these expenditures in general we expect production startup expense per production line to be higher when we build an entirely new manufacturing facility compared with the addition of new production lines at an existing manufacturing facility or implementing changes to our manufacturing process at such existing facilities primarily due to the additional infrastructure investment required when building an entirely new facility on a going forward basis the only costs included in production startup expense will be plant level expansions production startup expense is attributable to our components segment 

goodwill impairment   

during the fourth quarter of 2011 we determined that goodwill related to our components segment was impaired and recorded expense of 3934 million during 2013 and 2012 we had no goodwill impairments 

restructuring and asset impairments   

restructuring expenses include those expenses incurred related to material restructuring initiatives and include severance and employee termination costs that are directly related to our restructuring initiatives costs associated with contract terminations and other restructuring related costs these restructuring initiatives are intended to align the organization with our long term strategic plan including expected sustainable market opportunities and reduce costs see note 4 “restructuring and asset impairments”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2013  included in this annual report on form 10k asset impairment expenses include those expenses for reducing the net book value of certain assets to fair value expenses recognized for restructuring activities and asset impairments are discussed further above under “executive overview –restructuring and asset impairments” 

foreign currency loss gain   

foreign currency loss gain  consists of gains and losses resulting from holding assets and liabilities and conducting transactions denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries’ functional currencies 

interest income   

interest income  is earned on our cash cash equivalents marketable securities and restricted cash and investments interest income also includes interest received from notes receivable and any interest collected for late customer payments 

interest expense net   

interest expense is incurred on various debt financings we capitalize interest expense into our property plant and equipment or project assets when such costs qualify for interest capitalization reducing the amount of interest expense reported in any given period 

other expense income net   

other expense income net  is primarily comprised of other miscellaneous items changes in fair value of foreign exchange contracts and realized gainslosses on the sale of marketable securities 

income tax expense benefit   

  

income taxes are imposed on our taxable income by taxing authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate principally the united states germany and malaysia the statutory federal corporate income tax rate in the united states is 350  while the tax rates in germany and malaysia are approximately 296  and 250  respectively in malaysia we have been granted a longterm tax holiday scheduled to expire in 2027  pursuant to which substantially all of our income earned in malaysia is exempt from income tax 

results of operations 

 56 

the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  



segment overview 

we operate our business in two segments our components segment involves the design manufacture and sale of solar modules which convert sunlight into electricity we manufacture cdte modules and we also expect to begin manufacturing highefficiency crystalline silicon modules by the end of 2014 thirdparty customers of our components segment include project developers system integrators and owners and operators of pv solar power systems 

our second segment is our fully integrated systems business “systems segment” through which we provide complete turnkey pv solar power systems or solar solutions that draw upon our capabilities which include i project development ii epc services iii om services and iv project finance expertise we may provide our full epc services or any combination of individual products and services within our epc capabilities depending upon the customer and market opportunity all of our systems segment products and services are for pv solar power systems which use primarily our solar modules and such products and services are sold directly to investor owned utilities independent power developers and producers commercial and industrial companies and other pv solar power system owners 

  

in our operating segment financial disclosures we include an allocation of net sales value for all solar modules manufactured by our components segment and installed in projects sold or built by our systems segment in the net sales of our components segment in the gross profit of our operating segment disclosures we include the corresponding cost of sales value for the solar modules installed in projects sold or built by our systems segment in the components segment the cost of solar modules is comprised of the manufactured cost incurred by our components segment 

see note 23 “segment and geographical information”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2013  included in this annual report on form 10k 

see also item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  systems project pipeline” for a description of the projects in our advancedstage project pipeline due to the distinct size profitability and terms of the underlying sales arrangements for each project under construction timing of meeting all revenue recognition criteria may create uneven net sales and gross profit patterns making year over year comparisons less meaningful 

product revenue 

the following table sets forth the total amounts of solar modules and solar power systems net sales for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  for the purpose of the following table a solar module revenue is composed of total net sales from the sale of solar modules to third parties and b solar power system revenue is composed of total net sales from the 

 57 

sale of pv solar power systems and related services and solutions including the solar modules installed in the pv solar power systems we develop and construct 



solar module revenue sales to third parties increased 554 million during 2013  compared to 2012  primarily due to an increase in volume of watts sold of 39 partially offset by a 15 decrease in average selling prices per watt 

solar power system revenue decreased by 1150 million for the year ended 2013  compared to 2012  primarily due to the number and size of projects under construction between these periods as well as the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria have been met solar power system revenue included decreases in net sales from our av solar ranch one copper mountain 2 and topaz projects which are at various points of completion combined with reductions in net sales for substantially completed agua caliente alpine silver state north avra valley and greenough river projects these decreases were partially offset by increases in net sales from initial revenue recognition for our desert sunlight pnm and dewa projects combined with increases in net sales from our completed imperial energy center south project and our projects in canada including amherstburg belmont and walpole 

solar module revenue sales to third parties decreased by 12 billion for 2012  compared to 2011  primarily due to a 67 decrease in volume of watts sold and a 36 decrease in average selling prices per watt 

solar power system revenue increased by 18 billion for 2012  compared to 2011  primarily due to increases in net sales from our av solar ranch one topaz copper mountain 2 st clair silver state north alpine imperial energy center south and avra valley projects partially offset by decreases in net sales from our agua caliente amherstburg 2 santa teresa and paloma projects the increase in net sales is due to the number and size of projects under construction between the relevant periods as well as the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria have been met 

fiscal years ended december 31 2013  and 2012   

net sales 



net sales from our components segment which includes solar modules used in our systems projects decreased by 12 million  primarily due to a 17 decrease in average selling prices partially offset by a 19 increase in volume of watts sold 

net sales from our systems segment which excludes solar modules used in our systems projects decreased by 475 million  primarily due to the number and size of projects under construction between these periods as well as the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria have been met net sales from our system segment included decreases in net sales from our av solar ranch one copper mountain 2 and topaz projects which are at various points of completion combined with reductions in net sales for substantially completed agua caliente alpine silver state north avra valley and greenough river projects these decreases were partially offset by increases in net sales from initial revenue recognition for our desert sunlight pnm and dewa projects combined with increases in net sales from our completed imperial energy center south project and our projects in canada including amherstburg belmont and walpole 

cost of sales   

 58 



our costs of sales decreased by 696 million  or 3  and declined 08 as a percentage of net sales when comparing 2013   with 2012  the decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to a 448 million  reduction in cost of sales in our components segment and can largely be attributed to the following 2012  expenses that substantially did not occur in 2013  

 

in addition in 2013 we recorded a 179 million favorable adjustment to our cost of sales in connection with a decrease in the module collection and recycling liability as further discussed in note 13 “solar module collection and recycling liability”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2013 included in this annual report on form 10k these decreases in our cost of sales were partially offset by a 456 million increase associated with growth in the volume of solar modules sold net of cost reductions in our manufacturing process and module efficiency improvements in addition our cost of sales was unfavorably impacted by a 5 increase in underutilization of our manufacturing capacity during 2013  we ran our factories at approximately 77 capacity utilization primarily due to temporary idling of manufacturing lines in perrysburg and malaysia causing a 236 million increase in cost of sales 

additionally cost of sales decreased by 248 million  in our systems segment primarily for bos components and other construction costs related to the relative number and size of various utilityscale solar power systems under construction and the progress on such construction between the periods as well as the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria have been met 

our average manufacturing cost per watt declined by 010  per watt or 14  from 073  in 2012  to 063  in 2013  and included 001  of noncash stock based compensation the decrease is primarily the result of increased module efficiencies realized the closure of our german manufacturing plants at the end of 2012 and manufacturing improvement programs and cost savings initiatives that are being developed and implemented by our research and development and manufacturing teams 

gross profit 



  

gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased by 08 percentage point during 2013  compared with 2012  primarily due to the following i a 12 percentage point increase related to lower expense associated with voluntary remediation efforts for our 20082009 manufacturing excursion ii a 06 percentage point increase related to lower module collection and recycling liability iii a 07 percentage point increase due to lower accelerated depreciation expense for certain manufacturing equipment that have been replaced as part of our planned upgrade programs iv a 08 percentage point increase related to lower inventory writedown expense  and v a 05 percentage point increase due to lower costs associated with voluntary remediation efforts for workmanship issues affecting a limited number of solar modules manufactured between october 2008 and june 2009 these increases were partially offset by a 17 percentage point gross profit decrease in systems segment due to the mix of lower gross profit projects under construction between the periods and a 13 percentage point decrease due to lower gross profit for modules sold in our components segment primarily due to increased underutilization and lower average selling prices compared to module production costs between periods

research and development 



the overall increase in our rd expense primarily resulted from costs related to the improvement of our current generation modules integration of our module and bos technology into our pv power plants as well as development of our next generation cdte and crystalline silicon solar cells the increase in research and development expense of 18 million  year over year was primarily related our acquisition of cdte pv intellectual property assets and solar manufacturing processes from ge and an acquisition of crystalline silicon technology from tetrasun in connection with the ge acquisition we entered into a joint collaboration agreement with ge to collaborate on future technology development to further advance cdte solar technology rd expense increased 58 million as a result of tetrasun acquisition primarily due to incremental increase in labor facility and depreciation expenses as well as additional costs related to testing of the tetrasun cell manufacturing technology and development of crystalline silicon solar cells these increases were partially offset by i a 32 million decrease in personnelrelated expenses resulting from lower headcount sharebased and incentive compensation expense and ii a 08 million reduction in travel and other expenses as a result of our cost containment measures 

during 2013  we continued the development of our solar modules with increased efficiencies at converting sunlight into electricity and increased the average conversion efficiency of our solar modules from 126 in 2012  to 132 in 2013  

selling general and administrative 



our selling general and administrative expenses decreased by 107 million or 4 and were 82 and 83 as a percentage of net sales when comparing 2013  with 2012  respectively the most significant items affecting our selling general and administrative costs during 2013  and 2012  are as follows 

 

  production startup   



 60 

during 2013  and 2012  we incurred 28 million  and 78 million  respectively of production startup expenses expenses are primarily for global manufacturing personnel dedicated plant expansion new equipment installation equipment upgrades and process improvements for both new and existing plants on a going forward basis the only costs included in productionstart up expense will be plant level expansions 

restructuring and asset impairments 



during 2013  and 2012  we incurred 869 million  and 4691 million  respectively of restructuring and asset impairment charges of which 52 million  and 4691 million  respectively related to restructuring initiatives announced in 2012 which included charges associated with the closure of our german manufacturing plants and our decision to not move forward with our previously planned 4line manufacturing plant in vietnam additionally during 2013  we recorded asset impairment expense of 565 million  related to the agreement to sell our mesa arizona facility and an additional 252 million  impairment charge to adjust the carrying value of our plant in vietnam which is held for sale the effect of these asset impairments reduced the book value of both our mesa arizona facility and vietnam plant to fair value less costs to sell see note 4 “restructuring and asset impairments”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2013  included in this annual report on form 10k 

foreign currency loss gain   



foreign currency loss gain decreased during 2013  compared with 2012  primarily due to differences between our economic hedge positions and the underlying exposure and changes in the associated exchange rates 

  

interest income 



interest income increased by 39 million  during 2013  compared with 2012  primarily due to interest earned on notes receivable affiliate of 14 million combined with increased interest earned on higher average balances of our cash cash equivalents marketable securities and notes receivable 

interest expense net   



interest expense net of amounts capitalized decreased during 2013  compared with 2012  primarily as a result of 47 million in expense during 2012  associated with the repayment of a german credit facility agreement the remaining decrease in interest expense net is primarily related to lower average outstanding debt balances between the periods partially offset by a decrease in capitalized interest during the period 

other expense income net 



 61 

other expense income net increased during 2013  compared with 2012  primarily as a result of a 45 million gain on the settlement of longterm debt recognized during 2012  in addition our financing fees including letter of credit and commitment fees we pay based on the average daily unused commitments under our revolving credit facility increased by 04 million year over year 

income loss before income taxes   



components segment loss before income taxes decreased by 4654 million  during 2013  compared with 2012  primarily due to higher net sales related to an increase in the volume of modules sold and lower restructuring expenses partially offset by higher asset impairment expenses in addition our components segment cost of sales decreased 4 during 2013  compared with 2012  primarily due to i a decrease in module collection and recycling liability ii a decrease in costs associated with voluntary remediation efforts for our 20082009 manufacturing excursion iii lower accelerated depreciation expense for certain manufacturing equipment that was replaced as part of our planned equipment upgrade programs iv lower inventory writedown expense primarily as a result of favorable fluctuations in inventory market pricing and v a decrease in costs associated with voluntary remediation efforts for workmanship issues affecting a limited number of solar modules manufactured between october 2008 and june 2009 these decreases were partially offset by higher cost of sales associated with growth in the volume of solar modules sold and underutilization charges 

systems segment income before income taxes decreased 474 million  during 2013  compared with 2012  primarily due to the difference in project gross profit mix for which revenue was recognized during 2013  compared with 2012  

income tax expense benefit 



income tax expense decreased by 314 million  during 2013  compared with 2012  the decrease in income tax expense in 2013  compared to 2012  is primarily attributable to a reduction in valuation allowance recorded year over year offset by an increase in pretax book income see note 19 “income taxes”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2013  included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

fiscal years ended december 31 2012  and 2011   

  

net sales 



the 22  increase in net sales for 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to a 165  increase in net sales by our systems segment which was partially offset by a 39  decrease in net sales from our components segment 

net sales from our systems segment which excludes solar modules used in our systems projects increased by 14 billion  primarily due to increases in net sales from our av solar ranch one topaz copper mountain 2 st clair silver state north alpine imperial energy center south and avra valley projects partially offset by decreases in net sales from our agua caliente 

 62 

amherstburg 2 santa teresa and paloma projects the increase in net sales is due to the number and size of projects under construction between the periods as well as the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria have been met 

net sales from our components segment decreased by 7556 million  primarily due to a 33 decrease in module average selling prices including modules used in our systems projects and an 8 decrease in the volume of watts sold 

cost of sales 



the 40  increase in cost of sales during 2012  compared with the year ended 2011  was primarily due to an 8666 million  increase in our systems segment primarily for bos and other construction costs related to an increase in the number and size of various utilityscale solar power systems under construction 

the increases were partially offset by a decrease in cost of sales for our component segment of 1452 million  including decreases of 1683 million due to a reduction in the volume of solar modules sold and continuous cost reductions in our manufacturing process and a 801 million reduction in expense for costs associated with voluntary remediation efforts related to our june 2008  june 2009 manufacturing excursion these component segment decreases were partially offset by a 443 million increase related to the underutilization of our manufacturing capacity primarily related to the idling of manufacturing lines in perrysburg malaysia and germany during portions of 2012 a 253 million increase for certain lower of cost or market inventory writedowns primarily as a result of declines in market pricing a 183 million increase related to accelerated deprecation for certain manufacturing equipment that will be replaced as part of our planned equipment upgrade programs and a 158 million increase in expense for costs associated with voluntary remediation efforts for a workmanship issue affecting a limited number of solar modules manufactured between october 2008 and june 2009 

  

our average manufacturing cost per watt declined by 002 per watt or 3 from 075  in 2011  to 073  in 2012  and included 001 of noncash stock based compensation the decrease is the result of increased module conversion efficiencies realized partially offset by increased underutilization during 2012  

gross profit 



  

gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased by 98 percentage point in 2012  compared with 2011  this decrease was primarily attributable to a 211 percentage point decrease due to lower thirdparty module average selling prices and volumes a 13 percentage point decrease related to plant underutilization a 06 percentage point decrease resulting from lower of cost or market inventory writedowns due to declines in market pricing during the year ended december 31 2012 a 16 percentage point decrease due to lower module gross profit for modules used in our systems projects a 05 percentage point decrease due to accelerated depreciation on certain manufacturing equipment that have been replaced as part of our planned equipment upgrade programs and a 05 percentage point decrease related to costs associated with voluntary remediation efforts for a workmanship issue potentially affecting a limited number of solar modules manufacturing between october 2008 and june 2009 the decreases were partially offset by a 126 percentage point increase in systems segment gross profit due to the mix of higher gross profit projects under construction between the periods and a 32 percentage point increase related to reduced costs associated with voluntary remediation efforts for our june 2008 to june 2009 manufacturing excursion 

research and development 

 63 



the decrease in research and development expense of 81 million  was primarily due to a 107 million decrease in personnelrelated expenses primarily driven by decreases in sharebased compensation expense of 78 million additionally facilities expense decreased by 15 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the year ended december 31 2011 for 2012 share based compensation expense decreased from 2011 primarily as a result of the impact of an increase in our actual forfeitures primarily due to restructuring activities and an increase in the estimated forfeiture rate for share based compensation awards during 2012 these decreases were partially offset by a 04 million increase in testing and qualification materials costs and a 37 million increase in other expenses which included noncapital projects and the disposal of miscellaneous property plant and equipment 

during 2012  we continued the development of our solar module technology by increasing the conversion efficiency of our modules from 119 in 2011  to 126 in 2012  

selling general and administrative 



the decrease in selling general and administrative expense of 1316 million  was primarily due to a 737 million decrease in salaries and personnelrelated expenses primarily driven by a decrease in sharebased compensation expense of 555 million for 2012  sharebased compensation expense decreased from 2011  primarily as a result of the impact of an increase in our actual forfeitures primarily due to restructuring activities and an increase in the estimated forfeiture rate for sharebased compensation awards there was also a 212 million decrease in project development and selling costs a 120 million decrease in professional service costs a 105 million decrease in allowance for doubtful accounts expense a 25 million decrease due to a reduction in travel expense and a 244 million decrease due to lower expense in 2012 related to the june 2008 to june 2009 manufacturing excursion these decreases were partially offset by a 93 million increase in infrastructure expenses relating to the early exit from certain administrative office leases and increased depreciation and a 33 million increase in other expenses relating to the disposal of miscellaneous property plant and equipment 

production startup 



during 2012  we incurred 78 million  of production startup expenses primarily for our global manufacturing personnel dedicated to the installation and implementation of new equipment equipment upgrades and process improvements for existing plants as well as certain expenses related to our previously planned manufacturing capacity expansions in vietnam and arizona during 2011  we incurred 336 million  of production startup expenses primarily for manufacturing capacity expansions in malaysia and germany and our previously planned manufacturing expansions in france vietnam and arizona 

goodwill impairment 



 64 

we determined the implied fair value of goodwill in the components reporting unit to be zero as of december 31 2011 as a result we impaired all of the goodwill in the components reporting unit in 2011 and recorded 3934 million of impairment expense during 2012 there were no impairments of goodwill 

see note 6 “goodwill and intangible assets”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2013  included in this annual report on form 10k 

restructuring and asset impairments   



during 2012  and 2011  we incurred 4691 million  and 604 million  of restructuring expenses respectively due to charges relating to a series of initiatives as further discussed in note 4 “restructuring and asset impairments”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2013  included in this annual report on form 10k 

foreign currency loss gain   



foreign currency loss increased during 2012  compared with 2011  primarily due to differences in foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and differences in exchange rates primarily related to euro and malaysian ringgit 

interest income 



interest income decreased during 2012  compared with 2011  primarily as a result of a reduction in interest received on longterm marketable securities and restricted investments during 2012  

interest expense net 

interest expense net of amounts capitalized increased during 2012  compared with 2011  primarily due to 47 million in expense during the year ended december 31 2012 associated with the repayment of the german facility agreement the remaining increase is primarily related to an increase in average longterm debt between the periods the remaining increase was primarily due to a reduction in the amount of assets under construction and project assets that qualify for capitalized interest during the year ended december 31 2012  compared to the year ended december 31 2011  increasing interest expense net 

interest expense is incurred on various debt financings we capitalize interest expense into our property plant and equipment or project assets when such costs qualify for interest capitalization reducing the amount of interest expense reported in any given reporting period see also note 9 “consolidated balance sheet details”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2013  included in this annual report on form 10k 

other expense income net 

 65 



other income net increased during 2012  compared with 2011  primarily as a result of timing differences for amounts included in other income net 

income loss before income taxes 



components segment loss before income before taxes increased 6633 million  during 2012  compared with 2011  primarily from expenses relating to a series of restructuring initiatives lower net sales which resulted from a decrease in both average selling prices and volumes inventory writedowns and underutilization charges partially offset by decreased expense associated with our voluntary remediation efforts for our june 2008 to june 2009 manufacturing excursion 

systems segment income loss before income taxes increased 6772 million  during 2012  compared with 2011  primarily due to increased systems segment revenue during 2012  compared with 2011  due to an increase in the number and size of projects under construction for which all revenue recognition criteria were met 

income tax expense benefit   



income tax expense increased by 708 million  during 2012  compared with 2011  the increase in income tax expense in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily attributable to the establishment of valuation allowances against previously established deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions operating losses generated in jurisdictions for which no tax benefit is recorded and a greater percentage of profits earned in higher tax jurisdictions see note 19 “income taxes”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2013  included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2013  we believe that our cash cash equivalents marketable securities cash flows from operating activities including the contracted portion of our advancedstage project pipeline availability under our revolving credit facility considering minimum liquidity covenant requirements and access to the capital markets will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months we intend to continue to carefully execute against our ltsp and manage credit and market risk however if our financial results or operating plans change from our current assumptions we may not have sufficient resources to support the execution of our ltsp 

cash generated from operations including the contracted portion of our advancedstage project pipeline is our primary source of operating liquidity and we believe that internally generated cash flows combined with our existing cash and cash equivalents marketable securities and availability under our revolving credit facility considering minimum liquidity covenant requirements are sufficient to support daytoday business operations we monitor our working capital to ensure we have adequate liquidity both domestically and internationally to support the execution of our ltsp 

in june 2013 we sold 97 million shares of common stock for proceeds of 4282 million net of issuance costs in july 2013 we entered into an amendment to our revolving credit facility which extended 4500 million in availability through july 2018 additionally we have an active shelf registration statement filed with the sec for issuance of debt or equity securities if needed 

 66 

we intend to maintain appropriate debt levels based upon cash flow expectations the overall cost of capital and expected cash requirements for operations capital expenditures and discretionary strategic spending in the future we may also engage in one or more debt or equity financings potentially including project specific nonrecourse debt financings we believe that when necessary we will have adequate access to the capital markets although our ability to raise capital on terms commercially acceptable to us could be constrained if there is insufficient lender or investor interest due to industrywide or companyspecific concerns such financings could result in increased debt service expenses or dilution to our existing stockholders if we are unable to obtain debt or equity financing on reasonable terms we may be unable to execute our ltsp 

as of december 31 2013  we had 17642 million  in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities compared with 10039 million  as of december 31 2012  cash cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december 31 2013  increased primarily as the result of cash generated from operating activities and the proceeds from an equity offering partially offset by the repayment of longterm debt and project acquisitions as of december 31 2013  and 2012  11726 million  and 5485 million  respectively of our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in us dollar and euro denominated holdings we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed 

our expanding systems business requires liquidity and is expected to continue to have significant liquidity requirements in the future the net amount of our project assets deferred project costs billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings and payments and billings for deferred project costs which approximates our net capital investment in under development under construction and completed pv solar power systems as of december 31 2013  was 5179 million  solar power project development and construction cycles which span the time between the identification of a site location to the commercial operation of a pv solar power system vary substantially and can take many years to mature as a result of these long project cycles we may need to make significant upfront investments of resources in advance of the receipt of any cash from the sale of such pv solar power systems these amounts include payment of interconnection and other deposits some of which are nonrefundable posting of letters of credit and incurring engineering permitting legal and other expenses additionally we may choose to use and from time to time have used our working capital the availability under our revolving credit facility or enter into nonrecourse project financing to finance the construction of our systems projects if such projects cannot be sold before construction begins depending upon the size and number of projects that we are developing and selffinancing the construction of the systems business has and is expected in the future to require significant liquidity for example we may have to substantially complete the construction of a systems project before such project is sold delays in construction progress or in completing the sale of our systems projects which we are selffinancing may also impact our liquidity we have historically financed these upfront investments for project development and when necessary construction primarily using working capital 

additionally we are evolving into a more flexible business model in which we may choose to retain ownership of one or more of our systems projects for a period of time after they become operational up to the useful life of the pv solar power system if we determine it would be of economic and strategic benefit to do so if for example we cannot sell a systems project at economics that are attractive to us or potential customers are unwilling to assume the risks and rewards typical of pv solar power system ownership we may instead elect to own and operate such systems project generally until such time that we can sell a project on economically attractive terms as we are currently doing for our maryland solar project as with traditional electricity generating assets the selling price of a solar power plant could be higher postcompletion to reflect the elimination of construction and performance risk and other uncertainties any such decision to own and operate a pv solar power system is expected to impact liquidity depending upon the size and cost of the project if such decision is made we may elect to enter into temporary or longterm nonrecourse project financing to reduce the impact on our liquidity and working capital we may also consider entering into “yieldco” or similar arrangements with respect to ownership interests in certain of our projects we define yieldco as an entity that owns cashgenerating infrastructure assets including solar power plants and similar to reits or mlps spins out ownership to the public markets we expect to own and operate one or more solar power plants delivering electricity to the grid in 2014 

the following considerations have impacted or are expected to impact our liquidity in 2014 and beyond 

  

  67 

we reach certain construction milestones such retainage amounts relate to construction costs incurred and construction work already performed 

 

there may be a delay in when our solar module inventory and bos parts can be converted into cash compared to a typical thirdparty module sale such timing differences temporarily reduce our liquidity to the extent that we have already paid for our bos parts or the underlying costs to produce our solar module inventory as previously announced we have adjusted and will in the future adjust as necessary our manufacturing capacity and planned solar module production levels to match expected market demand any decrease in planned production reduces our risk and the impact on liquidity of having excess solar module inventories that we must sell to third parties as we execute our ltsp and respond to market pricing uncertainties for solar modules our solar module inventory as of december 31 2013  is expected to primarily support our systems business including our advancedstage project pipeline with the remaining amounts being used to support expected near term demand for thirdparty module sales as of december 31 2013  approximately 199 million  or 58  of our solar module inventory was either onsite or intransit to our systems projects of this amount approximately 43 million  of solar module inventories or 13  of the total solar module inventory balance was physically segregated for the purpose of qualifying a project for the department of treasury’s section 1603 cash grant program prior to the program’s expiration in december 2011 such segregated solar module inventory is expected to be installed in the underlying systems project in the normal course of our construction which has not yet begun all bos parts are for our systems business projects 

 

 

 

  68 

majority of our capital expenditures for 2014 are expected to be in foreign currencies and are therefore subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

 

the unprecedented disruption in the credit markets that began in 2008 had a significant adverse impact on a number of financial institutions global sovereign debt problems and its impact on the balance sheets and lending practices of global banks in particular could negatively impact our access to and cost of capital and therefore could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and competitive position it could also similarly affect our customers and therefore limit the demand for our systems projects or solar modules as of december 31 2013  our liquidity and marketable securities and restricted investments have not been materially adversely impacted by the current credit environment and we believe that they will not be materially adversely impacted in the near future we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity and the credit markets however we cannot predict with any certainty the impact to us of any further disruption in the current credit environment 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes the key cash flow metrics for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  in thousands 



operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 8561 million  during 2013  and 7622 million  during 2012  compared with cash used in operating activities of 335 million  during 2011 the increase in operating cash flows during 2013  was primarily due to higher net cash received from customers in 2013 as compared to 2012 and 2011 in addition during 2013 our operating cash flows were unfavorably impacted by higher net cash paid to suppliers as compared to 2012 in addition during 2013 income tax refunds net of taxes paid decreased to 16 million  from 215 million  in 2012 as compared to net income tax payments of 462 million  in 2011 the excess tax benefit related to share based compensation arrangements was 351 million  for 2013 as compared to 274 million  for 2012 and 1108 million  for 2011 the remaining increase in cash provided by operating activities was the result of net differences in interest received interest paid and other operating activities in 2013 compared to 2012 and 2011 changes in net assets and liabilities increased our cash flow from operations by 1865 million  in 2013 versus an increase of 2037 million  in 2012 a decrease of 171 million  primarily as a result of the following 

 

 69 

 

  investing activities 

cash used in investing activities was 5371 million  during 2013  compared with 3837 million  during 2012  and 6765 million  during 2011 cash used in investing activities during 2013 included capital expenditures of 2826 million  compared to 3792 million  and 7318 million  in 2012 and 2011 respectively during 2013 our capital expenditures were lower in accordance with changing priorities under our ltsp and primarily related to production line equipment upgrades to facilitate the achievement of near term targets on our module cost and efficiency improvement roadmaps in 2012 and 2011 we made significant investments into previously planned manufacturing and recycling facilities in vietnam malaysia germany and mesa arizona and related manufacturing equipment cash proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment were 1164 million  during 2013 primarily as a result of the mesa sales agreement 51 million  during 2012 and 06 million  during 2011 during 2013 we increased our net investments in marketable securities by 3410 million  compared to decreases of our net investment totaling 795 million  and 1614 million  during 2012 and 2011 respectively based upon reductions in our estimated future endoflife collection and recycling costs we determined that no incremental funding was needed for the purchase of restricted investments during 2013 compared to 807 million  and 627 million  in 2012 and 2011 respectively during 2013 and 2012 we made cash investments in unconsolidated entities of 179 million  and 50 million  respectively primarily related to furthering our goal of expanding our service and product offerings and developing partnerships in new markets acquisitions net of cash acquired resulted in payments of 307 million  in 2013 compared to 24 million  in 2012 and 211 million  in 2011 payments for acquisitions in 2013 related primarily to acquisitions of solar chile sa a chileanbased solar project development company and tetrasun inc a development stage company with high efficiency crystalline silicon technology during the year ended 2012 we made a second payment of 24 million under the terms of the acquisition agreement related to our acquisition of ray tracker inc “ray tracker” a tracking technology and pv bos company we acquired in 2011 in an allcash transaction with an initial payment of 211 million the remaining change in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by a change in restricted cash and other investing activities during 2013 compared to 2012 and 2011 

financing activities 

cash provided by financing activities was 1012 million  during 2013 compared with cash used in financing activities of 891 million  during 2012 and cash provided by financing activities of 5712 million  during 2010 cash provided by financing activities during 2013 resulted primarily from the net cash proceeds from our june 2013 equity offering of 4282 million  and excess tax benefit from sharebased compensation arrangements of 351 million  partially offset by the repayment of longterm debt and economic development funding of 733 million and net repayment of borrowings under our revolving credit facility of 2700 million  

cash used in financing activities during 2012 resulted primarily from the repayment of longterm debt which included our german facility agreement for a total of 1788 million  and the repayment of economic development funding of 68 million  partially offset by the net proceeds from our revolving credit facility of 700 million  and excess tax benefit from sharebased compensation arrangements of 274 million  

cash provided by financing activities during 2011 resulted primarily from proceeds of 3701 million  from borrowings on our malaysian ringgit facility agreement german facility agreement and malaysian euro facility along with 1000 million  of net proceeds from borrowings under our revolving credit facility in addition we received 162 million  in economic development funding recorded excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation arrangements of 1108 million  and received cash from employee stock option exercises of 83 million  we used 338 million  of cash for the repayment of longterm debt

the following table presents our contractual obligations as of december 31 2013  in thousands which consists of legal commitments requiring us to make fixed or determinable cash payments we purchase raw materials for inventory or balance of systems parts services and manufacturing equipment from a variety of vendors we also enter into contracts for the construction of solar power projects during the normal course of business in order to manage manufacturing and construction lead times and help assure adequate supply we enter into agreements with suppliers that either allow us to procure goods and services when we choose or that establish purchase requirements each year or over the term of the agreement 



 

 

 

 

 

in addition to the amounts shown in the table above we have recorded 1469 million  of unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with asc 740 income taxes  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 

debt and credit sources 

as of december 31 2013  we had 2230 million  in outstanding longterm debt excluding amounts related to capital leases and unamortized discount and 1589 million  in outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees our longterm debt consisted of the following at december 31 2013  and december 31 2012  in thousands 

 71 



at december 31 2013  future principal payments on our longterm debt excluding amounts related to capital leases and unamortized discounts were due as follows in thousands 



revolving credit facility   

our credit agreement with several financial institutions as lenders jp morgan securities llc and bank of america securities llc as jointlead arrangers and bookrunners and jp morgan chase bank na as administrative agent “revolving credit facility” provides us with a senior secured credit facility with an aggregate available amount of 6000 million  with the right to request an increase up to 7500 million  subject to certain conditions borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at i the libor adjusted for eurocurrency reserve requirements plus a margin of 225 or ii a base rate as defined in the credit agreement plus a margin of 125 depending on the type of borrowing requested by us these margins are subject to adjustments depending on our consolidated leverage ratio as of december 31 2013 and 2012 we had zero  and 2700 million  of borrowings under our revolving credit facility respectively we had 1586 million  and 1309 million  of letters of credit using availability under our revolving credit facility leaving 4414 million  and 1991 million  of availability at december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively we believe that when necessary we will have adequate access to capital markets but there may be circumstances in the future related to macroeconomic conditions or factors specific to us that could limit or increase the cost of capital from such markets 

in addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the revolving credit facility  we are required to pay a commitment fee currently at the rate of 0375  per annum based on the average daily unused commitments under the facility the commitment fee may also be adjusted due to changes in our consolidated leverage ratio we also pay a letter of credit fee equal to the applicable margin for eurocurrency revolving loans on the face amount of each letter of credit and a fronting fee of 0125  

on july 15 2013 we entered into the fourth amendment to the amended and restated revolving credit facility the “amendment” the amendment provided for among other things the division of the revolving credit facility into tranche a commitments in an aggregate amount equal to 4500 million  and tranche b commitments in an aggregate amount equal to 1500 million  and the extension of the maturity date of the tranche a loans until july 15 2018 the maturity date of the tranche b loans and commitment is october 15 2015 and is unchanged the amendment also contained certain covenant changes 

in connection with the amendment we entered into an amended and restated guarantee and collateral agreement loans and letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility are jointly and severally unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by first solar inc first solar electric llc first solar electric california inc and first solar development llc and are secured by security interests in substantially all of the grantors’ tangible and intangible assets other than certain excluded assets 

 72 

the revolving credit facility  contains financial covenants including a leverage ratio covenant a minimum ebitda covenant and a minimum liquidity covenant we are also subject to customary nonfinancial covenants we were in compliance with these covenants as of december 31 2013  and expect to remain in compliance with these covenants for at least the next twelve months 

see note 14 “debt”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2013  included in this annual report on form 10k for further information about our longterm debt facilities 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we have no offbalance sheet debt or similar obligations other than financial assurance instruments and operating leases that are not classified as debt we do not guarantee any thirdparty debt see note 15 “commitments and contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2013  included in this annual report on form 10k for further information about our financial assurance instruments 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 3 “recent accounting pronouncements”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2013  included in this annual report on form 10k for a summary of recent accounting pronouncements 

critical accounting estimates 

in preparing our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” we make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts of reported assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities in our financial statements and the related notes thereto some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in the selection of the appropriate assumptions for making these estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty we base our judgments and estimates on our historical experience our forecasts and other available information as appropriate our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2013  included in this annual report on form 10k 

our critical accounting estimates which require the most significant management estimates and judgment in determining amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k are as follows 

revenue recognition — systems business  we recognize revenue for arrangements entered into by our systems business generally using two revenue recognition models following the guidance in asc 605 accounting for longterm construction contracts or for arrangements which include land or land rights asc 360 accounting for sales of real estate 

for systems business sales arrangements that do not include land or land rights and thus are accounted for under asc 605 we use the percentageofcompletion method as described further below using actual costs incurred over total estimated costs to develop and construct a project including module costs as our standard accounting policy unless we cannot make reasonably dependable estimates of the costs to complete the contract in which case we would use the completed contract method 

for systems business sales arrangements that are accounted for under asc 360 where we convey control of land or land rights we record the sale as revenue using one of the following revenue recognition methods based upon evaluation of the substance and form of the terms and conditions of such real estate sales arrangements 

i we apply the percentageofcompletion method as further described below to certain real estate sales arrangements where we convey control of land or land rights  when a sale has been consummated we have transferred the usual risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer the initial and continuing investment criteria have been met we have the ability to estimate our costs and progress toward completion and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met the initial and continuing investment requirements which demonstrate a buyer’s commitment to honor their obligations for the sales arrangement can typically be met through the receipt of cash or an irrevocable letter of credit from a highly credit worthy lending institution when evaluating whether the usual risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the buyer we consider whether we have or may be contingently required to have any prohibited forms of continuing involvement with the project prohibited forms of continuing involvement in a real estate sales arrangement may include us retaining risks or rewards associated with the project that are not customary with the range of risks or rewards that an engineering procurement and construction “epc” contractor may assume 

 73 

ii depending on whether the initial and continuing investment requirements have been met and whether collectability from the buyer is reasonably assured we may align our revenue recognition and release of project assets or deferred project costs to cost of sales with the receipt of payment from the buyer if the sale has been consummated and we have transferred the usual risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer 

iii we may also record revenue for certain sales arrangements after construction of discrete portions of a project or after the entire project is substantially complete we have transferred the usual risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer and we have received substantially all payments due from the buyer or the initial and continuing investment criteria have been met 

for any systems business sales arrangements containing multiple deliverables including our solar modules not required to be accounted for under asc 360 real estate or asc 605 longterm construction contracts we analyze each activity within the sales arrangement to ensure that we adhere to the separation guidelines of asc 605 for multipleelement arrangements we allocate revenue for any transactions involving multiple elements to each unit of accounting based on its relative selling price and recognize revenue for each unit of accounting when all revenue recognition criteria for a unit of accounting have been met 

revenue recognition — percentageofcompletion in applying the percentageofcompletion method we use the actual costs incurred relative to estimated costs to complete including module costs in order to estimate the progress towards completion to determine the amount of revenue and profit to recognize incurred costs include all installed direct materials installed solar modules labor subcontractor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance such as indirect labor supplies and tools we recognize direct material and solar module costs as incurred costs when the direct materials and solar modules have been installed in the project when contracts specify that title to direct materials and solar modules transfers to the customer before installation has been performed we will not recognize revenue or associated costs until those materials are installed and have met all other revenue recognition requirements we consider direct materials and solar modules to be installed when they are permanently placed or affixed to the solar power system as required by engineering designs solar modules manufactured by us that will be used in our solar power systems which we still hold title to remain within inventory until such modules are installed in a solar power system 

the percentageofcompletion method of revenue recognition requires us to make estimates of contract revenues and costs to complete our projects in making such estimates management judgments are required to evaluate significant assumptions including the cost of materials and labor expected labor productivity the impact of potential variances in schedule completion the amount of net contract revenues and the impact of any penalties claims change orders or performance incentives changes in estimates for systems business sales arrangements accounted for under the percentageofcompletion method occur for a variety of reasons including but not limited to i changes in estimates to reflect actual costs ii construction plan acceleration or delays iii module pricing forecast changes and iv change orders from customers changes in estimates could have a material effect on our consolidated statements of operations 

if estimated total costs on any contract are greater than the contract revenues we recognize the entire estimated loss in the period the loss becomes known the cumulative effect of the revisions to estimates related to contract revenues and costs to complete contracts including penalties incentive awards claims change orders anticipated losses and others are recorded in the period in which the revisions to estimates are identified and the loss can be reasonably estimated the effect of the changes on future periods are recognized as if the revised estimates had been used since revenue was initially recognized under the contract such revisions could occur in any reporting period and the effects may be material depending on the size of the contracts or changes in estimates 

revenue recognition — components business our components business sells solar modules directly to third party solar power system integrators and operators we recognize revenue for modules sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery of the module has occurred and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer the sales price is fixed or determinable and the collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured under this policy we record a trade receivable for the selling price of our module and reduce inventory for the cost of goods sold when delivery occurs in accordance with the terms of the sales contracts our customers typically do not have extended payment terms or rights of return for our products we account for rebates or other customer incentives as a reduction to the selling price of our solar modules at the time of sale and therefore as a reduction to revenue 

accrued solar module collection and recycling liability at the time of sale we recognize an expense for the estimated cost of our future obligation for collecting and recycling solar modules sold that are covered by our prefunded collection and recycling program we estimate the cost of our collection and recycling obligations based on the present value of the expected probability weighted future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules which includes estimates for the cost of packaging 

 74 

the solar modules for transport the cost of freight from the solar module installation sites to a recycling center the material labor capital costs and scale of recycling centers and an estimated thirdparty profit margin and return on risk for collection and recycling services we base this estimate on our experience collecting and recycling our solar modules and on our expectations about future developments in recycling technologies and processes about economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled and about the expected timing of when our solar modules will be returned for recycling in the periods between the time of our sales and the settlement of our collection and recycling obligations we accrete the carrying amount of the associated liability by applying the discount rate used for its initial measurement 

during the third quarter of 2013 we completed an annual cost study of estimated future collection and recycling costs and adjusted our estimates which resulted in a reduction to our endoflife recycling obligation as part of the cost study we obtained a high volume of operational cost data from our latest recycling technology that provided a longerterm representation of actual costs to compare against our estimates based on this actual operational run data and recycling operational improvements made throughout the year we have reduced our estimated future collection and recycling cost per module at december 31 2013  our estimated liability for collecting and recycling solar modules covered by our collection and recycling program was 2252 million  a 1 increase in our annualized inflation rate used in our estimated future collection and recycling cost per module would increase our liability by 570 million  and a 1 decrease in that rate would decrease our liability by 437 million  

product warranties and accrued expense in excess of product warranty  we provide a limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for 10 years following delivery to the owners of our solar modules 

we also typically warrant to the owners of our solar modules that solar modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 90  of their labeled power output rating during the first 10 years following their installation and at least 80  of their labeled power output rating during the following 15 years in resolving claims under both the defects and power output warranties we have the option of either repairing or replacing the covered solar modules or under the power output warranty providing additional solar modules to remedy the power shortfall we also have the option to make a payment for the then current market price for solar modules to resolve claims our warranties are automatically transferred from the original purchasers of our solar modules to subsequent purchasers upon resale in 2013 we announced to our customers the availability of a new linear power output warranty for modules shipping beginning in the second quarter of 2014 

as an alternative to our module power output warranty we have offered a system level module performance warranty for a limited number of our recent system sales this system level module performance warranty is designed for utility scale systems and provides 25year plantlevel energy degradation protection the system level module performance warranty typically is calculated as a percentage of a system’s expected energy production adjusted for certain actual site conditions with the warranted level of performance declining each year in a linear fashion but never falling below 80 during the term of the warranty in resolving claims under the system level module performance warranty to restore the system to warranted performance levels we first must validate that the root cause is due to module performance then we typically have the option of either repairing or replacing modules providing supplemental modules or making a cash payment consistent with our module power output warranty when we elect to satisfy a valid warranty claim by providing replacement or supplement modules under the system level module performance warranty we do not have any obligation to pay for the labor to remove or install modules 

in addition to our solar module warranty described above for solar power plants built by our systems business we typically provide a limited warranty on the balance of the system against defects in engineering design installation and workmanship for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a phase or the entire solar power plant in resolving claims under the engineering design installation and workmanship warranties we have the option of remedying the defect through repair or replacement 

when we recognize revenue for module or systems project sales we accrue a liability for the estimated future costs of meeting our limited warranty obligations we make and revise these estimates based primarily on the number of our solar modules under warranty installed at customer locations our experience with warranty claims our monitoring of field installation sites our internal testing of and the expected future performance of our solar modules and bos components and our estimated permodule replacement cost such estimates have changed and may in the future change based primarily upon historical experience including additional information received from the evaluation of warranty claims and the complete processing of such claims 

we also make an estimate for the costs of any voluntary remediation programs including our 20082009 manufacturing excursion our estimate for remediation costs for our 20082009 manufacturing excursion is based on evaluation and consideration of currently available information including the estimated number of affected modules in the field historical experience related to our remediation efforts customerprovided data related to potentially affected systems the estimated costs of performing any remediation services and the postsale expenses covered under our remediation program from time to time we have taken 

 75 

remediation actions in respect of affected modules beyond our limited warranty and we may elect to do so in the future in which case we would incur additional expenses that are beyond our limited warranty if we commit to any such remediation actions beyond our limited warranty developing our estimates for such remediation actions may require significant management judgment 

at december 31 2013  our accrued liability for product warranty and accrued expense in excess of product warranty was 1980 million  and 521 million  respectively we have historically estimated our product warranty liability for power output and defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions to have an estimated warranty return rate of approximately 3  of modules covered under warranty a 1  change in the estimated warranty return rate would change our estimated product warranty liability by approximately 55 million  

accounting for income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the united states and its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining our provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit we regularly assess the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and subsequent years’ examinations and we record tax liabilities as appropriate 

 we establish liabilities for potential additional taxes that may arise out of tax audits once established we adjust the liabilities when additional information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring an adjustment significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the actual cost of a legal claim tax assessment or regulatory fine or penalty may ultimately be materially different from our recorded liabilities if any 

 in preparing our consolidated financial statements we calculate our income tax expense based on our interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business this requires us to estimate our current tax obligations and the realizability of uncertain tax positions and to assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities the net current amount of which we show as a component of current assets or current liabilities and the net noncurrent amount of which we show as other assets or other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 

we must also assess the likelihood that each of our deferred tax assets will be realized to the extent we believe that realization of any of our deferred tax assets is not more likely than not we establish a valuation allowance when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a reporting period we generally record a corresponding tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations conversely to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed which generally reduces our overall income tax expense 

we also consider the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and determine whether such amounts are indefinitely reinvested outside the united states we have concluded that except for the earnings of our canadian subsidiary and with respect to previously taxed income all such accumulated earnings are currently indefinitely reinvested accordingly no additional taxes have been accrued that might be incurred if such amounts were repatriated to the united states if our intention to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries changes additional taxes may be required to be accrued see note 19 “income taxes”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2013  included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

longlived asset impairment  we are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of longlived assets including “property plant and equipment” and “project assets” when an indicator of impairment has been identified we review our longlived assets each reporting period to assess whether impairment indicators are present we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event indicating potential impairment has occurred 

for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss a longlived asset or project asset is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities we must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 

for longlived assets when impairment indicators are present we compare undiscounted future cash flows including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value to the asset group’s carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable this assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived 

 76 

from the assets to be held and used assessments also consider changes in asset group utilization including the temporary idling of capacity and the expected timing of placing this capacity back into production 

for an asset group that fails the test of recoverability described above the estimated fair value of longlived assets may be determined using an “income approach” “market approach” “cost approach” or a combination of one or more of these approaches as appropriate for the particular asset group being reviewed all of these approaches start with the forecast of expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of longlived assets we also utilize thirdparty valuations and information available regarding the current market for similar assets if there is an impairment a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the asset groups fair value and carrying value prior to impairment this may require judgment in estimating future cash flows relevant discount rates and residual values applied in the income approach used in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used 

goodwill  goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the estimated fair value assigned to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed we do not amortize goodwill but instead are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually we will perform an impairment test between scheduled annual tests if facts and circumstances indicate that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill is less than its carrying value 

  

we may first make a qualitative assessment of whether it is morelikelythannot that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test the qualitative impairment test includes considering various factors including macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors a sustained share price or market capitalization decrease and any reporting unit specific events if it is determined through the qualitative assessment that a reporting unit’s fair value is morelikelythannot greater than its carrying value the twostep impairment test is not required if the qualitative assessment indicates it is morelikelythannot that a reporting unit’s fair value is not greater than its carrying value we must perform the twostep impairment test we may also elect to proceed directly to the twostep impairment test without considering such qualitative factors 

the first step in a twostep impairment test is the comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount including goodwill we have historically defined our reporting units to be consistent with our reportable segments systems and components this year in connection with the tetrasun acquisition we determined that the tetrasun business also constitutes a reporting unit within the components reportable segment and we now assess whether goodwill impairment exists at the crystalline silicon components reporting unit in accordance with the authoritative guidance over fair value measurements we define the fair value of a reporting unit as the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date we primarily use the income approach methodology of valuation which includes the discounted cash flow method and the market approach methodology of valuation which considers values of comparable businesses to estimate the fair values of our reporting units we do not believe that a cost approach is relevant to measuring the fair values of our reporting units 

significant management judgment is required when estimating the fair value of our reporting units including the forecasting of future operating results the discount rates and expected future growth rates that we use in the discounted cash flow method of valuation and in the selection of comparable businesses that we use in the market approach if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value assigned to that unit goodwill is not impaired and no further analysis is required 

if the carrying value assigned to a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value in the first step then we are required to perform the second step of the impairment test in this step we assign the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in step one to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit as if a market participant just acquired the reporting unit in a business combination the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in the first step of the impairment test over the total amount assigned to the assets and liabilities in the second step of the impairment test represents the implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference if there is no such excess then all goodwill for a reporting unit is considered impaired 

inprocess research and development inprocess research and development “iprd” is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter when an iprd project is complete we reclassify it as a definitelived intangible asset and amortize it over its estimated useful life if an iprd project is abandoned we will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to our consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned significant management judgment is required when estimating the fair value of our iprd intangible assets including the forecasting of future operating results the discount rates and expected future growth rates that we use in the discounted cash flow method of valuation we are also required to track capitalized rd project costs to properly test assets for impairment and determine the point of project completion or abandonment rd costs incurred after the acquisition date related to iprd assets acquired are charged to expense when incurred unless they have an alternative future use 

 77 

reportable segment allocations  we operate our business in two segments our components segment involves the design manufacture and sale of solar modules which convert sunlight into electricity we manufacture cdte modules and we also expect to begin manufacturing highefficiency crystalline silicon modules by the end of 2014 thirdparty customers of our components segment include project developers system integrators and operators of renewable energy projects 

our second segment is our fully integrated systems business “systems segment” through which we provide complete turnkey pv solar power systems or solar solutions that draw upon our capabilities which include i project development ii engineering procurement and construction “epc” services iii operating and maintenance “om” services and iv project finance expertise we may provide our full epc services or any combination of individual products and services within our epc capabilities depending upon the customer and market opportunity all of our systems segment products and services are for pv solar power systems which use our solar modules and such products and services are sold directly to investor owned utilities independent power developers and producers commercial and industrial companies and other system owners 

in our operating segment financial disclosures we include an allocation of sales value for all solar modules manufactured by our components segment and installed in projects sold or built by our systems segment in the net sales of our components segment in the gross profit of our operating segment disclosures we include the corresponding cost of sales value for the solar modules installed in projects sold or built by our systems segment in the components segment the cost of solar modules is comprised of the manufactured cost incurred by our components segment 

after we have determined the amount of revenue earned for our systems projects following the applicable accounting guidance for the underlying sales arrangements we allocate module revenue from the systems segment to the components segment based on how our codm strategically views these segments the amount of module revenue allocated from the systems segment to the components segment is equal to an estimated average selling price for such solar modules as if the modules were sold to a third party epc customer through a long term supply agreement that establishes pricing at the beginning of each year in order to develop the estimate of the average selling price used for this revenue allocation we utilize a combination of our actual third party module sale transactions our competitor benchmarking and our internal pricing lists used to provide module price quotes to customers this allocation methodology and the estimated average selling prices are consistent with how our codm views the value proposition our components business brings to a utility scale systems project and the financial information reviewed by our codm in assessing our components business performance 

our components and systems segments have certain of their own dedicated administrative key functions such as accounting legal finance project finance human resources procurement and marketing costs for these functions are recorded and included within the respective selling general and administrative costs for our components and systems segments our corporate key functions consist primarily of companywide corporate tax corporate treasury corporate accountingfinance corporate legal investor relations corporate communications and executive management functions these corporate functions and the assets supporting such functions benefit both the components and systems segments we allocate corporate costs to the components and systems segments as part of selling general and administrative costs based upon the estimated benefits provided to each segment from these corporate functions we determine the estimated benefits provided to each segment for these corporate costs based upon a combination of the estimated time spent by corporate employees supporting each segment and the average relative selling general and administrative costs incurred by each segment before such corporate allocations infrequent and other miscellaneous costs including restructuring and manufacturing excursions are included in the components or systems segment operating results based upon which segment incurred the underlying costs

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our primary foreign currency exposures are cash flow exposure transaction exposure and earnings translation exposure 

cash flow exposure  we expect our subsidiaries to have material future cash flows including net sales and expenses that will be denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries’ functional currencies our primary cash flow exposures are cash received from customers cash paid to suppliers and associates changes in the exchange rates between our subsidiaries’ functional currencies and the other currencies in which they transact will cause fluctuations in the cash flows we expect to receive or pay when these cash flows are realized or settled accordingly we enter into foreign exchange forward and crosscurrency swap contracts to hedge the value of a portion of these forecasted cash flows these foreign exchange forward and crosscurrency swap 

 78 

contracts qualified for and were designated as cash flow hedges we initially report the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss in “accumulated other comprehensive income loss” and subsequently reclassify amounts into earnings when the underlying hedged transaction is settled 

our operations in malaysia pay a portion of their operating expenses such as associate wages and utilities in malaysian ringgit exposing us to foreign currency exchange risk for those malaysian ringgit expenses as we expand into new markets worldwide particularly emerging markets our total foreign currency exchange risk in terms of both size and exchange rate volatility and the number of foreign currencies we are exposed to could increase significantly 

for additional details on our derivative hedging instruments and activities refer to note 10 “derivative financial instruments”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2013  included in this annual report on form 10k 

our international operations accounted for 14  20  and 55  of our net sales during the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively of which 38  18  and 78  of these international sales respectively were denominated in euros as a result we have exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to our net sales fluctuations in exchange rates particularly in the us dollar to euro and us dollar to malaysian ringgit affect our gross profit and could result in foreign exchange and operating losses in the past most of our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk has related to currency gains and losses between the time we sign and settle our sales contracts denominated in euros for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  a 10 change in the euro exchange rates would have impacted our net euro sales by 183 million  116 million  and 1237 million  respectively excluding the effect of our hedging activities 

transaction exposure many components of our business have assets and liabilities primarily receivables investments accounts payable debt and accrued liabilities and solar module collection and recycling liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the subsidiary’s functional currency changes in the exchange rates between our subsidiaries’ functional currencies and the other currencies in which these assets and liabilities are denominated can create fluctuations in our reported consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other derivative instruments to economically hedge assets and liabilities against the shortterm effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations the gains and losses on these derivative instruments will offset all or part of the transaction gains and losses that we recognize in earnings on the related foreign currency assets and liabilities these contracts typically have maturities of less than three months  

for additional details on our economic hedging instruments and activities refer to note 10 “derivative financial instruments”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2013  included in this annual report on form 10k 

if the us dollar would have weakened by 10 against the euro malaysian ringgit indian rupee and chilean peso the impact on our income before income taxes during the year ended december 31 2013  would have been 08 million  unfavorable 

earnings translation exposure  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to translate the financial statements of our subsidiaries that do not have a us dollar functional currency we may decide to purchase forward exchange contracts or other instruments to offset this impact from currency fluctuations these contracts would be markedtomarket on a monthly basis and any unrealized gain or loss would be recorded in earnings we do not hedge translation exposure at this time but may do so in the future 

in the past currency exchange rate fluctuations have had an impact on our business and results of operations for example currency exchange rate fluctuations impacted our cash flows by 36 million  favorable 63 million  favorable and 214 million  unfavorable in the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively although we cannot predict the impact of future currency exchange rate fluctuations on our business or results of operations we believe that we will continue to have risk associated with currency exchange rate fluctuations in the future we will continue to evaluate actions we can take to use derivative instruments to help mitigate this risk 

interest rate risk 

our primary interest rate risks relate to our outstanding variable rate debt our solar power system sales prices from the effect of interest rates on our customer’s financing of such solar power systems and our investments in marketable securities and restricted investments 

variable rate debt exposure we are exposed to interest rate risk because our revolving credit facility malaysian ringgit facility agreement malaysian euro facility agreement and the floating rate portion of our malaysian facility agreement have variable interest rates exposing us to variability in interest expense and cash flows we use interest rate and crosscurrency swap 

 79 

contracts to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated with a portion of our variable rate debt instruments we have interest rate swap contracts in place to mitigate the interest rate risk for the floating rate portion of our malaysian facility agreement we also have a crosscurrency swap contract in place to mitigate the interest rate risk of our malaysian ringgit facility agreement 

for additional details on our derivative hedging instruments and activities refer to note 10 “derivative financial instruments”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2013  included in this annual report on form 10k 

 an increase in the euro interbank offered rate “euribor” would impact our cost of borrowing under our malaysian euro facility agreement  and an increase in the prime rate and london interbank offered rate “libor” would impact our cost of borrowing under our revolving credit facility  if euribor changes by 100 basis points our interest cost for the year ended december 31 2013  would have changed by 05 million  if the prime rate and libor changed by 100 basis points our interest cost for the year ended december 31 2013  would have changed by 03 million  

effect of interest rates on our customer’s financing of solar power systems  we are exposed to interest rate risk because many of our systems business customers depend on debt and equity financing to purchase a solar power system from us although the useful life of a solar power system is considered to be approximately 25 years owners of our solar power systems must pay the entire cost of the solar power system by the time such system is completed as a result many of our customers rely on debt financing to fund their upfront capital expenditures an increase in interest rates available to finance such purchases could make it difficult for our customers to secure the financing and underlying interest rate necessary to purchase a system this could lower demand or the price we can charge for our solar power systems and reduce our net sales and gross profit in addition we believe that a significant percentage of our customers purchase solar power systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt an increase in interest rates could lower an investor’s return on investment in a system or make alternative investments more attractive relative to solar power systems which in each case could cause these endusers to seek alternative investments that promise higher returns 

investments in marketable securities and related investment exposure  we invest in various debt securities which exposes us to interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and provide liquidity while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the market value of the investment to fluctuate for example if we hold a security that was issued with an interest rate fixed at the thenprevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises the market value of our investment may decline 

as of december 31 2013  our marketable securities earned a pretax yield of 001  with a weighted average maturity of 10 months  if interest rates were to instantaneously change by 100 basis points the market value of our total investment portfolio would change by 38 million  we do not believe that a 10 change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows as of december 31 2013  all of our marketable securities were in commercial paper us debt us government obligations foreign debt and foreign government obligations  

as of december 31 2013  our restricted investments earned a pretax yield of 1107  with a weighted average maturity of approximately 211  years if interest rates were to instantaneously change by 100 basis points the market value of our total restricted investment portfolio would change by 590 million  given that our restricted investment portfolio prefunds our estimated solar module collection and recycling obligations and given the expected holding period of these investments we believe it is unlikely that a 10 change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows as of december 31 2013  all of our restricted investments were in foreign and us government obligations 

commodity and component risk 

we are exposed to price risks for the raw materials components and energy costs used in the manufacture and transportation of our solar modules and bos parts used in solar power systems also some of our raw materials and components are sourced from a limited number of suppliers or a single supplier we endeavor to qualify multiple suppliers using a robust qualification process in some cases we also enter into longterm supply contracts for raw materials and components as a result we remain exposed to price changes in the raw materials and components used in our solar modules in addition a failure by a key supplier could disrupt our supply chain which could result in higher prices andor a disruption in our manufacturing or construction processes we may be unable to pass along changes in the cost of the raw materials and components for our products and systems to our customers and may be in default of our delivery obligations if we experience a manufacturing or construction disruption 

credit risk 

 80 

we have certain financial and derivative instruments that subject us to credit risk these consist primarily of cash cash equivalents marketable securities restricted investments trade accounts receivable interest rate swap contracts crosscurrency swap contracts and foreign exchange forward contracts we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial and derivative instruments we place cash cash equivalents marketable securities restricted investments interest rate swap contracts crosscurrency contracts and foreign exchange forward contracts with various highquality financial institutions and limit the amount of credit risk from any one counterparty we continuously evaluate the credit standing of our counterparty financial institutions 

in addition we have certain investments in debt securities related to countries in the eurozone these investments are for debt securities of countries with a lower likelihood of experiencing significant economic fiscal andor political strains resulting in a default or severe decreases in fair value however such risk cannot be entirely eliminated and is reflected in the current fair value of the investments as of december 31 2013

 item 9a controls and procedures 

a evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain “disclosure controls and procedures” as such term is defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met additionally in designing disclosure controls and procedures our management was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures the design of any disclosure control and procedure also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 

 83 

based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level 

b management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate “internal control over financial reporting” as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2013  based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework 1992  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 

based on the results of our evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2013  

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2013  has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in its report which appears herein 

c changes in internal control over financial reporting 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer conducted an evaluation of our “internal control over financial reporting” as defined in exchange act rule 13a15f and rule 15d15f to determine whether any changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the year ended december 31 2013  that materially affected or are reasonably likely to material affect our internal control over financial reporting 

based on that evaluation there have been no such changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2013  that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

d inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud control systems no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control systems’ objectives are being met further the design of any control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of all controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within our company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of error or mistake control systems can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

 item 1 business 

overview 

we are a premier global provider of solar energy solutions we manufacture and sell photovoltaic “pv” solar modules with an advanced thinfilm semiconductor technology and we design construct and sell pv solar power systems that use the solar modules we manufacture we are the world’s largest thinfilm pv solar module manufacturer and one of the world’s largest pv solar module manufacturers 

in addressing overall global demand for pv solar electricity we have developed a differentiated fully integrated systems business that can provide a competitively priced turnkey utilityscale pv system solution for system owners and competitively priced electricity to utility endusers our fully integrated systems business which uses the solar modules we manufacture has enabled us to increase module throughput drive cost reduction across the value chain identify and break constraints to sustainable markets and deliver compelling solutions to our customers and endusers with our fully integrated systems business we believe we are in a position to expand our business in economically sustainable markets in which support programs are minimal which are developing in areas with abundant solar resources and sizable electricity demand we are committed to continually lowering the cost of solar electricity and in the long term we plan to compete on an economic basis with conventional fossilfuelbased peaking power generation 

in furtherance of our goal of delivering affordable solar electricity we are continually focused on reducing pv solar system costs in four primary areas module manufacturing balance of systems “bos” costs consisting of the costs of the components of a solar power system other than the solar modules such as inverters mounting hardware trackers grid interconnection equipment wiring and other devices and installation labor costs project development costs and the cost of capital first with respect to our module manufacturing costs our advanced technology has allowed us to reduce our average module manufacturing costs to among the lowest in the world for modules produced on a commercial scale based on publicly available information in 2012  our total average manufacturing costs were 073  per watt which is competitive on a comparable basis with those of traditional crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers based on publicly available information by continuing to improve conversion efficiency production line throughput and lower material costs we believe that we can further reduce our manufacturing costs per watt and maintain cost competitiveness with traditional crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers second with respect to our bos cost reduction roadmap we have aggressive programs which target key improvements in components and system design which when combined with continued improvements in conversion efficiency volume procurement around standardized hardware platforms use of innovative installation techniques and know how and accelerated installation times are expected to result in substantial reductions in our bos costs resulting in a lower system levelized cost of energy third with respect to our project development costs we seek optimal site locations in an effort to minimize transmission and permitting costs and to accelerate lead times to electricity generation finally with respect to the cost of capital by continuing to demonstrate the financial viability and operational performance of our utilityscale pv solar power plants and increasing our pv solar power system operating experience we believe we can continue to lower the cost of capital associated with our pv solar power systems thereby further enhancing the economic viability of our projects and lowering the cost of electricity generated by pv solar power systems that incorporate our modules and technology 

we believe that combining our reliable lowcost module manufacturing capability with our systems business enables us to more rapidly reduce the price of solar electricity accelerate the adoption of our technology in utilityscale pv solar power systems and identify and remove constraints to the successful migration to sustainable solar markets around the world our vertically integrated capabilities enable us to maximize value and mitigate risk for our customers and thereby deliver meaningful pv energy solutions to varied energy problems worldwide we offer leadership across the entire solar value chain resulting in more reliable and cost effective pv energy solutions for our customers and furthering our mission to create enduring value by enabling a world powered by clean affordable solar electricity

see note 25 “segment and geographical information”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further information on our business segments 

long term strategic plan 

in may 2012 we provided information regarding our long term strategic plan “long term strategic plan” or “ltsp” to transition to primarily sustainable opportunities by the end of 2016 in executing the ltsp we are focusing on providing solar pv generation solutions using our modules to sustainable geographic markets that we believe have a compelling need for massscale pv electricity including new markets throughout the americas asia the middle east and africa as part of our ltsp we expect to focus on opportunities in which our solar pv generation solutions will compete directly with fossil fuel offerings on a levelized cost of energy basis execution of the ltsp will entail a reallocation of resources around the globe in particular dedicating resources to regions such as latin america asia the middle east and africa where we have not traditionally conducted significant business to date we evaluate and manage closely the appropriate level of resources required as we transition into and penetrate these specific markets we intend to dedicate significant capital and resources to reduce the total installed cost of solar pv generation to optimize the design and logistics around our solar pv generation solutions and to ensure that our solutions integrate well into the overall electricity ecosystem of the specific region 

components business 

our components business involves the design manufacture and sale of solar modules which convert sunlight into electricity 

solar modules 

each solar module is a glass laminate approximately 2ft x 4ft 60cm x 120cm in size that encapsulates a cadmium telluride “cdte” thinfilm semiconductor our solar modules had an average rated power per module of approximately 86 watts  80 watts  and 76 watts  for 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively in december 2012 we announced the release of our most advanced thinfilm pv module the series 3 fs392 which is rated at 925 watts our semiconductor structure is a singlejunction polycrystalline thinfilm that uses cdte as the absorption layer and cadmium sulfide as the window layer cdte has absorption properties that are highly matched to the solar spectrum and can deliver competitive conversion efficiencies using only about 12 of the amount of semiconductor material ie silicon that is used to manufacture traditional crystalline silicon solar modules one of the drivers of first solar modules’ performance advantage over crystalline silicon modules is a lower temperature coefficient delivering higher energy yields at elevated operating temperature typical of utilityscale solar power plants in sunny regions 

manufacturing process 

we manufacture our solar modules on highthroughput production lines and perform all manufacturing steps ourselves in an automated proprietary and continuous process our solar modules employ a thin layer of semiconductor material to convert sunlight into electricity our manufacturing process eliminates the multiple supply chain operators and expensive and time consuming batch processing steps that are used to produce crystalline silicon solar modules currently we manufacture our solar modules at our perrysburg ohio and kulim malaysia manufacturing facilities 

we have integrated our manufacturing processes into a continuous production line with the following three stages the deposition stage the cell definition and treatment stage and the assembly and test stage in the deposition stage panels of transparent oxide coated glass are robotically loaded onto the production line where they are cleaned heated and coated with thin layers of cadmium sulfide followed by a layer of cdte using our proprietary vapor transport deposition technology after which the semiconductorcoated plates are cooled rapidly to increase strength in the cell definition and treatment stage we use high speed lasers to transform the large single semiconductor coating on the glass plate into a series of interconnected cells that deliver the desired current and voltage output in this stage we also treat the semiconductor film using proprietary chemistries and processes to improve the device performance and we apply metal terminated sputtered back contact finally in the assembly and test stage we apply busbars interlaminate material and a rear glass cover sheet that is laminated to encapsulate the semiconductor a junction box and termination wires are then applied to complete the assembly the final assembly stage is the only stage in our production line that requires manual processing 

we maintain a robust quality and reliability assurance program that monitors critical process parameters to ensure industry and internal standards are met this rigorous set of evaluations is conducted prior to each solar module undergoing acceptance testing for both electrical leakage and power measurement on a solar simulator the quality and reliability tests complement production surveillance with an ongoing monitoring program subjecting production modules to accelerated life cycle and stress testing to ensure conformance to iec and ul requirements this program assures a high level of product quality and reliability helping to predict power performance in the field 

research development and engineering 

we continue to devote a substantial amount of resources to research and development with the primary objective of lowering the cost of electricity generated by pv systems using our solar modules we conduct our research and development activities primarily in the united states within our components business we focus our research and development activities on among other areas continuing to increase the conversion efficiency of our solar modules and improving manufacturing efficiencies including throughput improvement volume ramp and material cost reduction we believe the most promising ways of increasing the conversion efficiency of our solar modules include maximizing the number of photons that reach the absorption layer of the semiconductor material to facilitate conversion into electrons maximizing the number of electrons that reach the surface of the semiconductor and minimizing the electrical losses between the semiconductor layer and the back metal conductor 

in the course of our research and development activities we continuously explore and research technologies in our efforts to sustain competitive differentiation in our modules we typically qualify process and product improvements for full production at our perrysburg ohio plant and then use a systematic process to propagate them to our other production lines we believe that our systematic approach to research and development will provide continuous improvements and ensure uniform adoption across our production lines in addition our production lines are replicas of each other and as a result a process or production improvement on one line can be rapidly deployed to other production lines 

we have recently set a world record for cdte pv efficiency achieving research cell efficiency of 187 percent the research cell efficiency was certified at the us department of energy’s national renewable energy laboratory cell efficiency measures 

the proportion of light converted in a single solar cell our new record cell was produced using laboratory equipment and methods and is not intended to be representative of our manufacturing capability we believe that our record cell demonstrates a potential longterm module efficiency entitlement of over 17 using our commercial scale manufacturing equipment 

customers 

  

with respect to our components business during 2012  we sold the majority of our solar modules not included in our systems projects to solar power system project developers system integrators and operators headquartered in germany france india and the united states which either resell our solar modules to endusers or integrate them into solar power plants that they own operate or sell thirdparty module sales represented approximately 10 of our total 2012 net sales additionally we develop design construct and sell pv solar power systems that use the solar modules we manufacture 

as described above under “ business – long term strategic plan ”  we are investing in sustainable market development particularly in areas with abundant solar resources and sizable electricity demand including latin america asia the middle east and africa 

  

during 2012  nrg energy inc  exelon corporation  and midamerican renewables llc  individually accounted for more than 10  of our components segment’s net sales which includes the solar modules used in our systems projects all of the above customers also represented more than 10 of our consolidated net sales as described above under “business – long term strategic plan” we are seeking to develop additional customer relationships primarily in sustainable markets and regions which has and is expected to continue to reduce our customer and geographic concentration and dependence 

competition 

the renewable energy solar energy and solar module sectors are highly competitive and continually evolving as these sector participants strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete within the larger electric power industry we face intense competition for sales of solar modules which has and may continue to result in reduced margins and loss of market share with respect to our components business our primary sources of competition are currently crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers as well as other thinfilm module manufacturers and companies developing solar thermal and concentrated pv technologies certain of our existing or future competitors may be part of larger corporations that have greater financial resources and greater brand name recognition than we do and as a result may be better positioned to adapt to changes in the industry or the economy as a whole certain competitors may have direct or indirect access to sovereign capital which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time among pv module and cell manufacturers the principal methods of competition include sales price per watt conversion efficiency reliability warranty terms and customer payment terms in 2012 industry average module pricing continued to decline as competitors reduced prices to sellthrough inventories worldwide if competitors reduce module pricing to levels near or below their manufacturing costs or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time our results of operations could be adversely affected at december 31 2012  the global pv industry consisted of more than approximately 75 manufacturers of solar modules and cells in the aggregate these manufacturers had installed production capacity that significantly exceeded global demand in 2012 we believe this structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity significantly exceeds current global demand will continue for the foreseeable future and we expect that it will continue to put pressure on pricing which could adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition we expect to compete with future entrants to the pv industry that offer new technological solutions we may also face competition from semiconductor manufacturers and semiconductor equipment manufacturers or their customers several of which have already announced their intention to start production of pv cells solar modules or turnkey production lines 

we also face competition from companies that currently offer or are developing other renewable energy technologies including wind hydropower geothermal biomass and tidal technologies and other power generation sources that burn conventional fossil fuels 

raw materials 

our manufacturing process uses approximately 30 types of raw materials and components to construct a complete solar module one critical raw material in our production process is cadmium telluride of the other raw materials and components the following eight are also critical to our manufacturing process front glass coated with transparent conductive oxide cadmium sulfide photo resist laminate material tempered back glass cord platecord plate cap lead wire and solar connectors before we use these materials and components in our manufacturing process a supplier must undergo a rigorous qualification process we continually evaluate new suppliers and currently are qualifying several new suppliers and materials when possible we attempt 

to use suppliers that can provide a raw material supply source that is near our manufacturing locations reducing the cost and lead times for such materials a few of our critical materials or components are single sourced and most others are supplied by a limited number of suppliers 

solar module collection and recycling program 

first solar is committed to extended producer responsibility and takes into account the environmental impact of its products over their entire life cycle we established the solar industry’s first comprehensive module collection and recycling program that is designed to allow our modules including the glass and encapsulated semiconductor material to be treated and processed into new modules or other products the program is designed to maximize the recovery of valuable materials for use in new modules or other new products and minimize the environmental impacts associated with our modules at the end of their useful life approximately 90 of each collected first solar module under this program can be recycled into materials for use in new products including new solar modules endusers with solar modules covered by the program can request collection and recycling of their eligible solar modules by us at any time at no additional cost 

we fund the estimated collection and recycling cost incremental to amounts already prefunded in prior years for the cumulative modules covered by the program within 90 days of the end of each fiscal year assuming for this purpose a minimum service life of 25 years  for our solar modules in addition to achieving substantial environmental benefits our solar module collection and recycling program may provide us the opportunity to resell or redistribute working modules or recover certain raw materials and components for reuse in our manufacturing process we currently have recycling facilities operating at each manufacturing facility with sufficient capacity for manufacturing scrap anticipated warranty returns and modules collected at the end of their useful life over the next several years that produce glass suitable for use in the production of new glass products and unrefined semiconductor materials that will be further processed by a third party supplier and then used to produce semiconductor materials for use in new solar modules 

in the fourth quarter of 2012 we made prospective changes to the program outside the european union “eu” under this program change customers as part of their overall power plant decommissioning obligations will now be responsible for ensuring modules are either recycled or responsibly disposed of at the end of their useful life first solar will offer termbased recycling services to customers at their cost to help them meet these obligations this change supports our ongoing transition to being a premier provider of adaptable solar energy solutions for our power plant customers 

  

the european union’s waste electronics and electrical equipment “weee” directive places the obligation of recycling including collection treatment and environmentally sound disposal of electrical and electronic equipment “eee” products upon manufacturers from 2014 this directive will also be applicable to solar pv modules for modules sold to and installed in the eu at this time we will continue to maintain a commitment to cover and prefund the estimated collection and recycling costs consistent with our historical program prior to the changes made in the fourth quarter of 2012 once detailed legal requirements of the transposed weee directive become known in 2013 we will adjust the program in the various eu member states as required and before the weee directive becomes effective in 2014 additionally for all modules subject to a sales arrangement prior to the above discussed change we have an obligation and will maintain the commitment to collect and recycle such covered modules consistent with our historical prefunded solar module collection and recycling program 

to ensure that the prefunded amounts for covered modules under the program are available regardless of our financial status in the future a trust structure has been established funds are put into custodial accounts in the name of a trustee only the trustee can distribute funds from the custodial accounts for qualified collection and recycling costs these funds cannot be accessed for any purpose other than for qualified module collection and recycling costs of first solar modules such collection and recycling services will either be performed by us or a third party 

solar module warranties 

we provide a limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for 10 years following delivery to the owners of our solar modules we also typically warrant to our owners that solar modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 90 of their labeled power output rating during the first 10 years following their installation and at least 80 of their labeled power output rating during the following 15 years in resolving claims under both the defects and power output warranties we have the option of either repairing or replacing the covered solar modules or under the power output warranty providing additional solar modules to remedy the power shortfall we also have the option to make a payment for the then current market price for solar modules to resolve claims our warranties are automatically transferred from the original purchasers of our solar modules to subsequent purchasers upon resale 

as an alternative to our module power output warranty we have offered a system level module performance warranty for a 

limited number of our recent system sales this system level module performance warranty is designed for utility scale systems and provides 25year plantlevel energy degradation protection the system level module performance warranty typically is calculated as a percentage of a system’s expected energy production adjusted for certain actual site conditions with the warranted level of performance declining each year in a linear fashion but never falling below 80 during the term of the warranty in resolving claims under the system level module performance warranty to restore the system to warranted performance levels we first must validate that the root cause is due to module performance then we typically have the option of either repairing or replacing modules providing supplemental modules or making a cash payment consistent with our module power output warranty when we elect to satisfy a valid warranty claim by providing replacement or supplement modules under the system level module performance warranty we do not have any obligation to pay for the labor to remove or install modules 

  from time to time we have taken remediation actions in respect of affected modules beyond our limited warranty and we may elect to do so in the future in which case we would incur additional expenses such potential voluntary future remediation actions beyond our limited warranty obligation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations if we commit to any such remediation actions 

systems business 

through our fully integrated systems business we provide a complete turnkey solar power system solution or any combination of our systems solutions which may include project development epc services om services and project finance 

our systems business has grown over the past several years through a combination of business acquisitions and organic growth in april 2009 we completed the acquisition of the project development business of optisolar inc which included a multigigawatt project pipeline in july 2010 we completed the acquisition of nextlight renewable power llc “nextlight” a leading developer of utilityscale solar projects in the southwestern united states which also included a multigigawatt project pipeline 

project development 

our systems business is primarily dependent upon successful completion of project development activities including site selection and securing rights to acquire or use the site obtaining in a timely manner the requisite interconnection and transmission studies executing an interconnection agreement obtaining environmental and land use permits maintaining effective site control and entering into a power purchase agreement with an offtaker of the power to be generated by the project these activities culminate in receiving the right to construct and operate a solar power system depending on the market opportunity or geographic location we may acquire projects in various stages of development or acquire project companies from developers in order to complete the development process construct a pv power plant incorporating our modules and sell the system to a longterm project owner depending on the market opportunity or geographic location we may collaborate with local partners in connection with these project development activities ppas or fit structures define the price and terms the utility customer or investor will pay for power produced from a project entering into a ppa generally provides the underlying economics needed to finalize development including permitting beginning construction arranging the financing and marketing the project for sale to a longterm project owner depending primarily on the location stage of development upon our acquisition of the project and other site attributes the development cycle typically ranges from one to five years we may be required to incur significant costs for preliminary engineering permitting legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built if there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals we may be forced to incur additional costs writedown capitalized project assets and the right of the offtaker under the ppa to terminate may be triggered 

our systems business’ current and planned activities are focused on markets around the world primarily in sustainable markets 

in north america our projects currently account for substantially all of the 29 gw  ac advanced stage pipeline of projects that we are either currently constructing or expect to construct we are also developing other projects in north america that do not yet have ppas see item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – financial operations overview – net sales – systems business” for a listing of these projects 

in europe we have been engaged in project development activities with respect to certain projects in germany and we are actively evaluating additional project opportunities in turkey and emerging eastern european markets as well as mature western european solar markets 

in asia including india china and southeast asia latin america the middle east and africa we have been actively pursuing opportunities to offer a complete turnkey solar power solution or any combination of our pv systems solutions we 

expect our focus on and investment in these markets will continue to increase as we execute our long term strategic plan 

customers 

with respect to our systems business our customers consist of investor owned utilities independent power developers and producers commercial and industrial companies and other system owners who may purchase from us completed solar power plants which include our solar modules any combination of epc services and om services for the plants we build during 2012  the substantial majority of our systems business sales were generated in north america 

during 2012  the principal customers of our systems segment were nrg energy inc  exelon corporation  and midamerican renewables llc  each of which also accounted for more than 10 of our total net sales during 2012

with respect to our systems business we face competition from other providers of renewable energy solutions including developers of pv solar thermal and concentrated solar power systems and developers of other forms of renewable energy projects including wind hydropower geothermal biomass and tidal to the extent other solar module manufacturers become more vertically integrated we expect to face increased competition from such companies as well we also face competition from other epc companies and joint venture type arrangements between epc companies and solar companies while the decline in pv modules prices over the last several years has increased interest in solar electricity worldwide competition at the systems level can be intense thereby exerting downward pressure on systems level profit margins industrywide to the extent competitors are willing and able to bid aggressively low prices for new projects and ppas using low cost assumptions for modules bos components installation maintenance and other costs please see item 1a “risk factors  competition at the systems level can be intense depending on the market opportunity thereby potentially exerting downward pressure on systems level profit margins industrywide which could reduce our net sales profitability and adversely affect our results of operations” 

epc warranty 

in addition to our solar module warranties described above for solar power plants built by our systems business we typically provide a limited warranty on the balance of the system against defects in engineering design installation and workmanship for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a phase or the entire solar power plant in resolving claims under the engineering design installation and workmanship warranties we have the option of remedying the defect through repair or replacement 

research development and engineering 

        our systems business research and development activities are primarily focused on the objective of lowering the levelized cost of energy through reductions in bos costs improved systems design and energy yield enhancements associated with pv systems that use our solar modules we conduct our research and development activities for the systems business primarily in the united states innovations related to system design hardware platforms inverters trackers and installation techniques and know how among other things can and are expected in the future to continue to reduce bos costs which can represent a significant portion of the costs associated with the construction of a typical utilityscale pv solar power system 

support programs 

support programs for pv solar electricity generation depending on the jurisdiction include feedin tariffs “fits” quotas including renewable portfolio standards and tendering systems and net energy metering programs in addition to these financial incentives for pv solar electricity generation include tax incentives grants loans rebates and production incentives although we expect to become less impacted by and less dependent on support programs as we execute our long term strategic plan and transition into primarily sustainable markets support programs will continue to play varying roles in accelerating the adoption of pv solar systems around the world 

under a basic fit program producers of renewable energy are paid a set rate for their electricity usually differentiated according to the technology used and size of the installation for pv solar the rate has historically been set above market rates and is fixed for a period of up to 25 years in most countries with fits grid operators are obliged to provide priority and guaranteed access to the grid for renewable energy installations the additional costs of these schemes are generally passed through to the electricity consumers by way of a premium on the kilowatt hour “kwh” enduser price these fit subsidies have been critical for the development of the solar industry because they provided the demand visibility required for module manufacturers and other participants in the solar value chain to reduce costs and drive scale prior to 2011 the substantial majority of our module 

sales had been for gridconnected ground or commercial roof mounted solar power systems in germany and other european union countries with fit subsidies 

whereas fit laws set the price and let the market determine capacity and generation quota systems work in reverse in general governments mandate a minimum share of capacity or gridconnected generation of electricity to come from renewable energy sources this share often increases over time with a specific final target and enddate the mandate can be placed on producers distributors or consumers 

there are two main types of quota systems used obligationcertificate and tendering systems a renewable portfolio standard “rps” is in the former category under an rps regulated utilities and other load serving entities are required to procure a specified percentage of their total electricity sales to enduser customers from eligible renewable resources such as solar generating facilities by a specified date some programs may further require that a specified portion of the total percentage of renewable energy must come from solar generating facilities the majority of states in the us have enacted legislation adopting rps mechanisms rps legislation and implementing regulations vary significantly from state to state particularly with respect to the percentage of renewable energy required to achieve the state’s rps mandate the definition of eligible renewable energy resources and the extent to which renewable energy credits certificates representing the generation of renewable energy qualify for rps compliance measured in terms of the volume of renewable electricity required to meet its rps mandate california’s rps program is the most significant in the us and the california market for renewable energy dominates the western us region first enacted in 2002 california’s rps statute has been amended several times to increase the overall percentage requirement as well as to accelerate the target date for program compliance pursuant to amendments enacted by the california legislature in 2011 the california rps program now requires obligated load serving entities to procure 33 of their retail electricity demand from eligible renewable resources by 2020 in 2012 approximately 56 of our total net sales were derived from our systems projects or thirdparty module sales to solar power systems in california 

in contrast to an rps system tendering systems of procurement such as those used in south africa and india are focused on specific targets for new capacity in south africa for example the government is procuring bids under a competitive tender with solicitation dates spread over about two years the request for proposal “rfp” is the first major solicitation in support of a target of over 17 gw of renewable energy by 2030 in south africa’s integrated resource plan of which over 8 gw was allocated to pv solar project proponents bid competitively at each solicitation date until all the capacity has been allocated the tender solicitation approach allows governments or utilities to proscribe project construction time frames to achieve specific generation targets for the electricity system 

net energy metering programs enable endusers to install renewable systems and to offset their retail energy consumption with production from onsite facilities and in some cases to sell excess solar electricity to their retail electricity provider because the bundled cost of retail electricity usually exceeds the cost of unbundled electricity net energy metering programs provide an incentive to the enduser the policies governing net energy metering vary by jurisdiction and utility some utilities pay the enduser in advance while others credit the enduser’s bill 

tax incentive programs exist in the us at both the federal and state level and can take the form of investment and production tax credits accelerated depreciation and sales and property tax exemptions at the federal level investment tax credits for business and residential solar systems have gone through several cycles of enactment and expiration since the 1980’s in october 2008 the united states congress extended the 30 federal investment tax credit “itc” for both residential and commercial solar installations for eight years through december 31 2016 the itc is a primary economic driver of solar installations in the us its extension through 2016 has contributed to greater medium term demand visibility in the us however its expiration at the end of 2016 unless extended underscores the need for the levelized cost of electricity from solar systems to continue to decline toward grid parity 

in europe renewable energy targets in conjunction with fits have contributed to the growth in pv solar markets renewable energy targets prescribe how much energy consumption must come from renewable sources while fit policies are intended to support new supply development by providing investor certainty a 2001 european union “eu” directive for promoting renewable energy use in electricity generation “directive 200177ec” set varying national indicative targets for renewable energy production from individual member states a 2009 eu directive on renewable energy “directive 200928ec” which replaced the 2001 directive sets varying targets for all eu member states in support of the directive’s goal of a 20 share of energy from renewable sources in the eu by 2020 and requires national action plans that establish clear pathways for the development of renewable energy sources 

germany which accounted for approximately 3  of our 2012 net sales is expected to continue to be a small percentage of our net sales due to changes in policy support and demand in the context of the discussion on germany’s energy strategy “energiewende” the german government made significant changes in 2012 to the german renewable energy law or the eeg these changes which began to take effect in the second half of 2012 included significant and accelerated fit reductions for 

projects up to 10 mw and an elimination by the end of 2012 of fits for projects over 10 mw these fit changes particularly impact the competitiveness in germany of our core offering of largescale free field pv systems 

in australia which accounted for 1  of our 2012 net sales the solar industry is driven by several regulatory initiatives that support the installation of solar pv modules in both rooftop and freefield applications including the federal government’s national renewable energy target which has set a renewable energy goal of 20 by 2020 

in india which accounted for 2  of our 2012 net sales the national solar mission includes a goal of installing 22 gw of solar power generation capability by 2022 india also announced a fit policy for the first phase of the national solar mission in 2010 there have been significant achievements during the phase i of the national solar mission and several projects have been awarded ppas under various state programs as of december 2012 in december 2012 the ministry for new  renewable energy released the draft policy for phase ii of the national solar mission which mentions installation of approximately 10 gw of utility scale and 1 gw of offgrid solar power projects by the end of phase ii 20132017 

in china governmental authorities recently adopted a national fit policy for large scale projects china also expanded the golden sun program an upfront cost subsidy program aimed primarily at distributed generation in addition according to the current draft of the 12th 5year plan for solar energy the government intends to raise the 2015 goal for total cumulative solar energy capacity from 15 gw to 21 gw which was subsequently revised to 40 gw 

 in the middle east and north africa “mena” several countries have announced sizeable solar targets although policy mechanisms are in many cases not yet firmly established in the kingdom of saudi arabia a solar policy with a target of 41 gw of solar energy of which at least 16 gws is pv by 2030 was introduced in 2012 the selection of a market mechanism enabling the deployment of solar power plants is expected in 2013 while the expected potential of the mena markets is significant policy promulgation and market development are especially vulnerable to governmental inertia political instability geopolitical risk fossil fuel subsidization potentially stringent localization requirements and limited available infrastructure 

for more information about risks related to support programs and related economic incentives please see item 1a “risk factors  reduced growth in or the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives and other support for ongrid solar electricity applications could reduce demand andor price levels for our solar modules and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales and adversely impact our operating results” 

intellectual property 

our success depends in part on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technology and to conduct our business without infringing on the proprietary rights of others we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks and trade secrets as well as associate and third party confidentiality agreements to safeguard our intellectual property we regularly file patent applications to protect inventions arising from our research and development and are currently pursuing patent applications in the us and worldwide our patent applications and any future patent applications might not result in a patent being issued with the scope of the claims we seek or at all and any patents we may receive may be challenged invalidated or declared unenforceable in addition we have registered andor have applied to register trademarks and service marks in the us and a number of foreign countries for “first solar” and “first solar and design” 

with respect to proprietary knowhow that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce we rely on among other things trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests we believe that many elements of our pv module manufacturing process including our unique materials sourcing involve proprietary knowhow technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications including technical processes equipment designs algorithms and procedures we have taken security measures to protect these elements our research and development personnel have entered into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us these agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our associates to assign to us all of the inventions designs and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us we also require our customers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our modules technology or business plans 

we have not been subject to any material intellectual property infringement or misappropriation claims

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the following information together with the other information in this annual report on form 10k before buying shares of our stock if any of the following risks or uncertainties occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our stock could decline 

  

risks related to our markets and customers 

an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may continue to cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

solar manufacturers had installed production capacity that significantly exceeded global demand in 2012 we believe this structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity significantly exceeds current global demand will continue for the foreseeable future and we expect that it will continue to put pressure on pricing in light of the increase in global production capacity we engaged in a series of restructuring initiatives in 2012 to better align production with expected 

market demand including the closure of our german manufacturing operations in 2012 in 2012 industry average sales prices per watt “asps” continued to decline as competitors reduced asps to sellthrough inventories worldwide if our competitors reduce module pricing to levels near or below their manufacturing costs or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time or if demand for pv modules does not grow sufficiently to justify the current production supply our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

competition at the systems level can be intense thereby potentially exerting downward pressure on systems level profit margins industrywide which could reduce our net sales profitability and adversely affect our results of operations 

the significant decline in pv module prices over the last several years has and continues to create a challenging environment for module manufacturers but it has also increased interest in solar electricity worldwide by eroding one of the primary historical constraints to widespread solar market penetration namely its affordability aided by such lower module prices competitors have in many cases been willing and able to bid aggressively for new projects and ppas using low cost assumptions for modules bos components installation maintenance and other costs as the basis for such bids achievable barriers to entry for competitors has led to depending on the market and other factors intense competition at the systems level intense competition at the systems level can result in an environment in which systems level pricing falls rapidly thereby further increasing demand for solar solutions but constraining the ability for project developers epc companies andor verticallyintegrated solar companies such as first solar to sustain meaningful and consistent profitability accordingly while we believe our systems offerings and experience are positively differentiated in many cases from that of our competitors we may be unable to develop or maintain a sufficient magnitude of new systems projects worldwide at economically attractive rates of return and may not be able to achieve meaningful profitability under our long term strategic plan 

depending on the market opportunity we may be at a disadvantage compared to potential systemslevel competitors for example certain of our competitors may have a stronger andor more established localized business presence in a particular geographic region certain of our competitors may be larger entities that have greater financial resources and greater overall brand name recognition than we do and as a result may be better positioned to impact customer behavior or adapt to changes in the industry or the economy as a whole certain competitors may also have direct or indirect access to sovereign capital which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time 

additionally largescale solar systems are still in their relatively early stages of existence and depending on the geographic area many potential customers are still in the process of educating themselves about the points of differentiation among various available providers of pv solar solutions including a company’s proven overall experience and bankability system design  optimization expertise grid interconnection and stabilization expertise and proven om capabilities if we are unable over time to meaningfully differentiate our offerings at scale from the viewpoint of our potential customer base our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

if pv technology is not suitable for widespread adoption at economically attractive rates of return or if sufficient additional demand for solar modules does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate our net sales and profit may flatten or decline and we may be unable to sustain profitability 

the solar energy market is at a relatively early stage of development in comparison to fossil fuelbased electricity generation if pv technology proves unsuitable for widespread adoption at economically attractive rates of return or if additional demand for solar modules and systems fails to develop sufficiently or takes longer to develop than we anticipate we may be unable to grow our business or generate sufficient net sales to sustain profitability in addition demand for solar modules and systems in our targeted markets including north america latin america europe india china the middle east australia south africa and other foreign jurisdictions may develop to a lesser extent than we anticipate many factors may affect the viability of widespread adoption of pv technology and demand for solar modules and systems including the following 

 

 

 

 14 

 

 

reduced growth in or the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives renewable energy targets and other support for ongrid solar electricity applications or increase in protectionist or other adverse public policies could reduce demand andor price levels for our solar modules and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales and adversely impact our operating results 

although our long term strategic plan provides for first solar to transition over time toward operating in sustainable markets in the nearterm our net sales and profits remain subject to variability based on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives support programs federal state and local governmental bodies in many countries have provided subsidies in the form of fits rebates tax incentives and other incentives to endusers distributors systems integrators and manufacturers of pv products many of these support programs expire phase out over time require renewal by the applicable authority or may be amended a summary of recent developments in the major government support programs that can impact our business appears under item 1 “business – support programs” to the extent these support programs are reduced earlier than previously expected or freefield or conversion land applications are disadvantaged such changes could reduce demand andor price levels for our solar modules and systems lead to a reduction in our net sales and adversely impact our operating results 

      germany which accounted for approximately 3  of our 2012 net sales is expected to continue to be a small percentage of our net sales due to changing levels of policy support and demand in the context of the discussion on germany’s energy strategy “energiewende” the german government made significant changes in 2012 to the german renewable energy law or the eeg these changes which began to take effect in the second half of 2012 included significant and accelerated fit reductions for projects up to 10 mw and an elimination by the end of 2012 of fits for projects over 10 mw these fit changes particularly impact the competitiveness in germany of our core offering of largescale free field pv systems 

     in the middle east and north africa “mena” several countries have announced sizeable solar targets although policy mechanisms in many cases are not yet firmly established in the kingdom of saudi arabia a solar policy with a target of 41 gw of solar energy of which at least 16 gws is pv by 2030 was introduced in 2012 the selection of a market mechanism enabling the deployment of solar power plants is expected in 2013 while the expected potential of the mena markets is significant policy promulgation and market development are especially vulnerable to governmental inertia political instability geopolitical risk fossil fuel subsidization potentially stringent localization requirements and limited available infrastructure 

reduced growth in or the reduction elimination or expiration of support programs for ongrid solar electricity applications could reduce demand andor price levels for our solar modules and systems and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales and adversely impact our operating results 

our ability to pursue an expansion strategy in india could be adversely affected by protectionist or other adverse public policies 

under phase i of the national solar mission india required developers of solar pv projects employing crystalline silicon technology to use solar cells and modules manufactured in india in its draft policy for phase ii of the national solar mission india has stated that it is considering imposing similar local content requirements “lcrs” on thin film solar technologies such as first solar modules which currently comprise the majority of us solar exports to india in february 2013 the united states government announced that it had requested world trade organization dispute settlement consultations with the government of india concerning phase i local content requirements in the event india expands its lcrs for the national solar mission to include thinfilm modules our ability to participate in the national solar mission will be substantially reduced and possibly completely eliminated and thus our ability to pursue an expansion strategy in india would be adversely affected 

in addition first solar has received official notice from the indian government that india is investigating potential dumping of solar cells and modules from the us malaysia taiwan and china first solar is cooperating with the indian government and responding to its questionnaire we expect a final decision by the end of 2014 although a preliminary determination is likely to be made during the course of 2013 if we are deemed to have dumped our modules in india to the detriment of the domestic industry we could be assessed antidumping duties and our ability to pursue an expansion strategy in india could be adversely affected 

we could be adversely affected by any violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” and foreign antibribery laws  

the fcpa generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business other countries in which we operate also have antibribery laws some of which prohibit improper payments to government and nongovernment persons and entities our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we currently operate in and pursuant to our long term strategic plan intend to further expand into many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices in addition due to the level of regulation in our industry our entry into certain jurisdictions including india china and the middle east requires substantial government contact where norms can differ from us standards although we implement policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these antibribery laws our employees subcontractors and agents may take actions in violation of our policies and antibribery laws any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could subject us to criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and reputation 

  

we may be unable to fully execute on our long term strategic plan which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we face numerous difficulties in executing our long term strategic plan particularly in new foreign jurisdictions including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition please see the risk factors entitled “our substantial international operations subject us to a number of risks including unfavorable political regulatory labor and tax conditions in foreign countries” and “reduced growth in or the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidiaries economic incentives and other support for ongrid solar electricity could reduce demand andor price levels for our solar modules and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales and adversely impact our operating results” 

an increase in interest rates or lending rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets including a reduction in total tax equity availability could make it difficult for customers to finance the cost of a pv system and could reduce the demand for our solar systems or modules andor lead to a reduction in the average selling price for pv modules 

many of our customers and our systems business depend on debt andor equity financing to fund the initial capital expenditure required to develop build and purchase a pv system as a result an increase in interest rates or lending rates or a reduction in the supply of project debt financing or tax equity investments could reduce the number of solar projects that receive financing or otherwise make it difficult for our customers or our systems business to secure the financing necessary to develop build purchase or install a pv system on favorable terms or at all and thus lower demand for our solar modules which could limit our growth or reduce our net sales in addition we believe that a significant percentage of our endusers install pv systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt an increase in interest rates andor lending rates could lower an investor’s return on investment in a pv system increase equity return requirements or make alternative investments more attractive relative to pv systems and in each case could cause these endusers to seek alternative investments 

  

risks related to regulations 

existing regulations and policies and changes to these regulations and policies may present technical regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of pv products which may significantly reduce demand for our solar modules 

the market for electricity generation products is heavily influenced by foreign federal state and local government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry as well as policies promulgated by electric utilities these regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customerowned electricity generation in the united states and in a number of other countries these regulations and policies have been modified in the past and may be modified again in the future these regulations and policies could deter enduser purchases of pv products and investment in the research and development of pv technology for example without a mandated regulatory exception for pv systems utility customers are often charged interconnection or standby fees for putting distributed power generation on the electric utility grid if these interconnection standby fees were applicable to pv systems it is likely that they would increase the cost of using pv systems to our endusers which could make them less desirable thereby adversely affecting our business prospects results of operations and financial condition in addition with respect to utilities that utilize a peak hour pricing policy or timeofuse pricing methods whereby the price of electricity is adjusted based on electricity supply and demand electricity generated by pv systems currently benefits from competing primarily with expensive peak hour electricity rather than the less expensive average price of electricity modifications to the peak hour pricing policies of utilities such as to a flat rate for all times of the day would require pv systems to achieve lower prices in order to compete with the price of electricity from other sources 

we anticipate that our solar systems and modules will be subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with national and local ordinances relating to building codes safety environmental protection utility interconnection and metering and other matters it is a complex task to track the requirements of individual jurisdictions and design equipment to comply with the varying standards any new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to our solar modules may result in significant additional expenses to us or our customers and as a result could cause a significant reduction in demand for our solar systems and modules 

environmental obligations and liabilities could have a substantial negative impact on our financial condition cash flows and profitability 

our operations involve the use handling generation processing storage transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations at the national state local and international levels these environmental laws and regulations include those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the use management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites and occupational health and safety as we execute our long term strategic plan and expand our business into foreign jurisdictions worldwide our environmental compliance burden will continue to increase both in terms of magnitude and complexity we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs and capital expenditures in complying with these laws and regulations in addition violations of or liabilities under environmental laws or permits may result in restrictions being imposed on our operating activities or in our being subjected to substantial fines penalties criminal proceedings third party property damage or personal injury claims cleanup costs or other costs such solutions could also result in substantial delay or termination of projects under construction within our systems business which could adversely impact our results of operations while we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements future developments such as more aggressive enforcement policies the implementation of new more stringent laws and regulations or the discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition our solar modules contain cadmium telluride and cadmium sulfide elemental cadmium and certain of its compounds are regulated as hazardous materials due to the adverse health effects that may arise from human exposure based on existing research the risks of exposure to cadmium telluride are not believed to be as serious as those relating to exposure to elemental cadmium in our manufacturing operations we maintain engineering controls to minimize our associates’ exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds and require our associates who handle cadmium compounds to follow certain safety procedures 

including the use of personal protective equipment such as respirators chemical goggles and protective clothing relevant studies and third party peer review of our technology have concluded that the risk of exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds from our endproducts is negligible in addition the risk of exposure is further minimized by the encapsulated nature of these materials in our products and the physical properties of cadmium compounds used in our products and the recycling or responsible disposal of first solar’s modules while we believe that these factors and procedures are sufficient to protect our associates endusers and the general public from adverse health effects that may arise from cadmium exposure we cannot ensure that human or environmental exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds used in our products will not occur any such exposure could result in future third party claims against us as well as damage to our reputation and heightened regulatory scrutiny of our products which could limit or impair our ability to sell and distribute our products the occurrence of future events such as these could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

the use of cadmium in various products is also subject to governmental regulation in several countries more restrictive regulation in this area andor expansion of such regulation to additional countries could impact the manufacture sale collection and recycling of solar modules and could require us to make unforeseen environmental expenditures or limit our ability to sell and distribute our products 

  

risks related to our operations manufacturing and technology 

our operating history to date may not serve as an adequate basis to judge our future prospects and results of operations 

our historical operating results may not provide a meaningful basis for evaluating our business financial performance and prospects we may be unable to achieve similar growth or grow at all in future periods our ability to achieve similar growth in future periods is also affected by current economic conditions our past results occurred in an environment where among other things capital was at times more accessible to our customers to finance the cost of developing solar projects and economic incentives for solar power in certain markets such as the german fit were more favorable accordingly you should not rely on our results of operations for any prior period as an indication of our future performance 

we face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules as well as thinfilm solar modules and solar thermal and concentrated pv systems if global supply exceeds global demand it could lead to a reduction in the average selling price for pv modules  which could reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations 

the solar energy and renewable energy industries are highly competitive and continually evolving as participants strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete with the larger electric power industry within the global pv industry we face competition from crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers other thinfilm solar module manufacturers and companies developing solar thermal and concentrated pv technologies existing or future solar manufacturers might be acquired by larger companies with significant capital resources thereby intensifying competition with us in addition the introduction of a low cost disruptive technology could adversely affect our ability to compete which could reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations 

even if demand for solar modules continues to grow the rapid manufacturing capacity expansion undertaken by many solar module manufacturers particularly manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules has created and may continue to cause periods of structural imbalance during which supply exceeds demand see “an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may continue to cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations” in addition we believe a significant decrease in the cost of silicon feedstock would provide further reductions in the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules and lead to further pricing pressure for solar modules and potentially the oversupply of solar modules 

  

during any such period our competitors could decide to reduce their sales prices in response to competition even below their manufacturing costs in order to generate sales other competitors may have direct or indirect access to sovereign capital which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time as a result we may be unable to sell our solar modules at attractive prices or for a profit during any period of excess supply of solar modules which would reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations also we may decide to lower our average selling price to certain customers in certain markets in response to competition 

thinfilm technology has a short history and our thinfilm technology and solar modules and systems may perform below expectations problems with product quality or performance may cause us to incur significant andor unexpected warranty and related expenses damage our market reputation and prevent us from maintaining or increasing our market share 

researchers began developing thinfilm semiconductor technology over 25 years ago but were unable to integrate the 

technology into a solar module production line until about a decade ago we perform a variety of quality and life tests under different conditions upon which we base our assessments and warranty of product performance over its expected useful life however if our thinfilm technology and solar modules perform below expectations we could lose customers and face substantial warranty expense 

we provide a limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for 10 years following delivery to the owners of our solar modules we also typically warrant to our owners that solar modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 90 of their labeled power output rating during the first 10 years following their installation and at least 80 of their labeled power output rating during the following 15 years as a result we bear the risk of extensive warranty claims long after we have sold our solar modules and recognized net sales as an alternative to our module power output warranty we have offered a system level module performance warranty for a limited number of our recent sales as of december 31 2012  our accrued warranty liability was 1916 million  of which 906 million  was classified as current and 1010 million  was classified as noncurrent 

 we have historically estimated our product warranty liability for power output and defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions to have an estimated warranty return rate of approximately 3 of modules covered under warranty a 1 percentage point change in the estimated warranty return rate would change our estimated product warranty liability by approximately 46 million 

  

during the period from june 2008 to june 2009 a manufacturing excursion occurred whereby certain modules manufactured during that time period may experience premature power loss once installed in the field we initiated a voluntary remediation program beyond our standard warranty pursuant to which we made commitments to customers with systems containing modules affected by the manufacturing excursion that we would cover certain costs of remediation efforts we have expensed 2712 million total todate for the estimated costs of remediating systems affected by modules manufactured during the relevant period 

if any of our assumptions used in estimating the above referenced warranty or manufacturing excursion costs prove incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses which could adversely impact our financial position operating results and cash flows although we believe we have taken corrective actions to avoid similar manufacturing excursions in the future we cannot guarantee that our internal quality and testing programs will prevent a future manufacturing excursion from occurring any future manufacturing excursions including any commitments made by us to take remediation actions in respect of affected modules beyond our limited warranty could adversely impact our financial position operating results and cash flows 

although our power output warranty extends for 25 years our oldest solar modules manufactured during the qualification of our pilot production line have only been in use since 2001 as a result our warranty is based on a variety of quality and life tests that enable factbased predictions of durability and future performance these predictions however could prove to be materially different from the actual performance over the full life of our solar modules causing us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective solar modules in the future for example our glassonglass solar modules could break delaminate corrode or experience power degradation in excess of expectations and our manufacturing operations or supply chain could be subject to process variations that could cause affected modules to underperform compared to our expectations these risks could be amplified as we implement design and process changes in connection with our efforts to improve our product accelerate module conversion efficiency and manufacturing production throughput improvements as part of our long term strategic plan in addition as we increase the number of installations in nontemperate climates in accordance with our long term strategic plan we may experience increased failure rates due to deployment into such climates any widespread product failures may damage our market reputation cause our sales to decline require us to repair or replace the defective modules and cause us to take voluntary remedial measures beyond warranty terms to enhance customer satisfaction which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

in addition to our solar module warranty described above for solar power plants built by our systems business we typically provide a limited warranty on the balance of the system against defects in engineering design installation and workmanship for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a phase or the entire solar power plant any widespread failures of solar power plants built by us could result in significant increases to warranty expense damage our market reputation cause our sales to decline cause us to incur unexpected costs to remedy defects or otherwise negatively affect our results of operations 

if our estimates regarding the future cost of collecting and recycling solar modules covered by our collection and recycling program are incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses at and from the time we realize our estimates are incorrect and face a significant unplanned cash burden 

we have historically prefunded and will continue to prefund in certain jurisdictions our estimated future obligation for collecting and recycling solar modules covered by our collection and recycling program based on the present value of the expected future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules which includes estimates for the cost of packaging the solar modules for 

transport the cost of freight from the solar module installation sites to a recycling center the material labor capital costs and scale of recycling centers and an estimated thirdparty profit margin and return on risk for collection and recycling services we base our estimate on our experience collecting and recycling solar modules that do not pass our quality control tests and solar modules returned under our warranty and on our expectations about future developments in recycling technologies and processes and economic conditions at the time the solar modules are expected to be collected and recycled if our estimates prove incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses at and from the time we realize our estimates are incorrect and could also face a significant unplanned cash burden at the time we realize our estimates are incorrect or endusers return their solar modules which could harm our operating results in addition participating endusers can return their solar modules covered under the collection and recycling program at any time as a result we could be required to collect and recycle covered solar modules earlier than we expect 

our failure to further refine our technology reduce module manufacturing and bos costs and develop and introduce improved pv products could render our solar modules or systems uncompetitive and reduce our net sales profitability andor market share 

we need to continue to invest significant financial resources in research and development to continue to improve our module conversion efficiency lower the levelized cost of electricity “lcoe” of our pv systems and otherwise keep pace with technological advances in the solar energy industry however research and development activities are inherently uncertain and we could encounter practical difficulties in commercializing our research results we seek to continuously improve our products and processes and the resulting changes carry potential risks in the form of delays additional costs or other unintended contingencies in addition our significant expenditures on research and development may not produce corresponding benefits other companies are developing a variety of competing pv technologies including copper indium gallium diselenide and amorphous silicon which could produce solar modules or systems that prove more costeffective or have better performance than our solar modules or systems in addition other companies could potentially develop a highly reliable renewable energy system that mitigates the intermittent power production drawback of many renewable energy systems or offers other valueadded improvements from the perspective of utilities and other system owners in which case such companies could compete with us even if the lcoe associated with such new system is higher than that of our systems as a result our solar modules or systems may be negatively differentiated or rendered obsolete by the technological advances of our competitors which would reduce our net sales profitability andor market share 

in addition we often forward price our products and services in anticipation of future cost reductions and technology improvements and thus an inability to further refine our technology and execute our conversion efficiency roadmap and our longterm manufacturing cost bos cost and lcoe reduction objectives could adversely affect our margins and operating results 

our failure to protect our intellectual property rights may undermine our competitive position and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against third party allegations of infringement may be costly 

protection of our proprietary processes methods and other technology is critical to our business failure to protect and monitor the use of our existing intellectual property rights could result in the loss of valuable technologies we rely primarily on patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property we regularly file patent applications to protect inventions arising from our research and development and are currently pursuing such patent applications in the us and worldwide our existing patents and future patents could be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents or if patents are issued to us such patents may not be sufficient to provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies 

we also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position although we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our associates and third parties to protect our intellectual property such confidentiality agreements are limited in duration and could be breached and may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary manufacturing expertise adequate remedies may not be available in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise in addition others may obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or legal means the failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes equipment technology trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise methods and compounds could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries especially any developing countries into which we may expand our operations in some countries we have not applied for patent trademark or copyright protection 

  

third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary technologies or other intellectual property rights which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology can be difficult and expensive also litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our 

trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others we cannot assure you that the outcome of such potential litigation will be in our favor such litigation may be costly and may divert management attention and other resources away from our business an adverse determination in any such litigation may impair our intellectual property rights and may harm our business prospects and reputation in addition we have no insurance coverage against litigation costs and would have to bear all costs arising from such litigation to the extent we are unable to recover them from other parties 

some of our key raw materials and components are either singlesourced or sourced from a limited number of third party suppliers and their failure to perform could cause manufacturing delays and impair our ability to deliver solar modules to customers in the required quality and quantities and at a price that is profitable to us 

our failure to obtain raw materials and components that meet our quality quantity and cost requirements in a timely manner could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture our solar modules or increase our manufacturing cost some of our key raw materials and components are either singlesourced or sourced from a limited number of third party suppliers as a result the failure of any of our suppliers to perform could disrupt our supply chain and impair our operations in addition some of our suppliers are small companies that may be unable to supply our increasing demand for raw materials and components as we continue to expand rapidly we may be unable to identify new suppliers or qualify their products for use on our production lines in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms a constraint on our production may cause us to be unable to meet our capacity ramp plan andor our obligations under our customer contracts which would have an adverse impact on our financial results 

a disruption in our supply chain for cadmium telluride our semiconductor material could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture solar modules and could adversely impact our profitability and longterm growth prospects 

a key raw material we use in our production process is a cadmium telluride compound tellurium one of the main components of cadmium telluride is mainly produced as a byproduct of copper refining and therefore its supply is largely dependent upon demand for copper our supply of cadmium telluride could be limited if any of our current suppliers or any of our future suppliers are unable to acquire an adequate supply of tellurium in a timely manner or at commercially reasonable prices if our competitors begin to use or increase their demand for cadmium telluride supply could be reduced and prices could increase if our current suppliers or any of our future suppliers cannot obtain sufficient tellurium they could substantially increase prices or be unable to perform under their contracts we may be unable to pass increases in the cost of our raw materials through to our customers because our customer contracts do not adjust for raw material price increases and are generally for a longer term than our raw material supply contracts a substantial increase in tellurium prices could adversely impact our profitability and longterm growth objectives 

  

our future success depends on our ability to effectively balance manufacturing production with market demand and when necessary continue to build new manufacturing plants over time in response to such demand and add production lines in a costeffective manner all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties 

our future success depends on our ability to effectively balance manufacturing production with market demand and increase both our manufacturing capacity and production throughput over time in a costeffective and efficient manner if we cannot do so we may be unable to expand our business decrease our manufacturing cost per watt maintain our competitive position satisfy our contractual obligations or sustain profitability see “an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may continue to cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations” our ability to expand production capacity is subject to significant risks and uncertainties including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if any future production lines that we may build in the future are not built in line with our committed schedules it may impair any future growth plans if any future production lines do not achieve operating metrics similar to our existing production lines our solar modules could perform below expectations and cause us to lose customers 

if we are unable to systematically replicate our production lines as necessary over time and achieve and sustain similar operating metrics in our future production lines as we have achieved at our existing production lines our manufacturing capacity could be substantially constrained our manufacturing costs per watt could increase and this may impair our growth plans andor cause us to lose customers resulting in lower net sales higher liabilities and lower net income than we anticipate for instance future production lines could produce solar modules that have lower conversion efficiencies higher failure rates and higher rates of degradation than solar modules from our existing production lines and we could be unable to determine the cause of the lower operating metrics or develop and implement solutions to improve performance 

some of our manufacturing equipment is customized and sole sourced if our manufacturing equipment fails or if our equipment suppliers fail to perform under their contracts we could experience production disruptions and be unable to satisfy our contractual requirements 

some of our manufacturing equipment is customized to our production lines based on designs or specifications that we provide to the equipment manufacturer which then undertakes a specialized process to manufacture the custom equipment as a result the equipment is not readily available from multiple vendors and would be difficult to repair or replace if it were to become damaged or stop working if any piece of equipment fails production along the entire production line could be interrupted in addition the failure of our equipment suppliers to supply equipment in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms could delay our expansion plans and otherwise disrupt our production schedule or increase our manufacturing costs all of which would adversely impact our financial results 

if we are unable to further increase the number of sellable watts per solar module and reduce our manufacturing cost per watt our profitability could decline 

our profitability could decline if we are unable to continue to reduce our manufacturing cost per watt furthermore our failure to reduce cost per watt by increasing our efficiency may impair our ability to enter new markets that we believe will require lower cost per watt for us to be competitive and may impair our growth plans 

we may be unable to manage the expansion of our operations effectively 

we expect to continue to expand our business in order to provide utilityscale pv generation to existing and new geographic markets and to maintain or increase market share to manage the continued expansion of our operations we will be required to continue to improve our operational and financial systems procedures and controls and expand train and manage our growing associate base our management will also be required to maintain and expand our relationships with customers suppliers and other third parties and attract new customers and suppliers in addition our current and planned operations personnel systems and internal controls and procedures might be inadequate to support our future growth if we cannot manage our growth effectively we may be unable to take advantage of market opportunities execute our business strategies or respond to competitive pressures 

our substantial international operations subject us to a number of risks including unfavorable political regulatory labor and tax conditions in foreign countries 

we have significant marketing distribution and manufacturing operations both within and outside the united states we expect to continue to expand our operations into china india other countries in europe asia the middle east and elsewhere as a result we will be subject to the legal political social tax and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions risks inherent to international operations include but are not limited to the following 

 22 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

our business in foreign markets requires us to respond to rapid changes in market conditions in these countries our overall success as a global business depends in part on our ability to succeed in differing legal regulatory economic social and political conditions we may not be able to develop and implement policies and strategies that will be effective in each location where we do business 

risks related to our systems business 

project development or construction activities may not be successful and projects under development may not receive required permits real property rights power purchase agreements “ppas” interconnection and transmission arrangements or financing or construction may not commence or proceed as scheduled which could increase our costs and impair our ability to recover our investments 

the development and construction of solar power electric generation facilities and other energy infrastructure projects involve numerous risks we may be required to spend significant sums for land and interconnection rights preliminary engineering permitting legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built success in developing a particular project is contingent upon among other things 

 

 

 23 

 

 

 

 

 

 

successful completion of a particular project may be adversely affected by numerous factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if we are unable to complete the development of a solar power facility we fail to meet one or more agreed target construction milestone dates any agreed upon systemlevel capacity or energy output guarantees or warranties including for some projects twentyfive year energy performance or systemlevel module degradation warranties and guarantees or other contract terms or our projects cause grid interference or other damage we may be subject to forfeiture of significant deposits under power purchase agreements or interconnection agreements or termination of such agreements significant liquidated damages penalties andor other obligations under the epc agreement or other agreements relating to the project including obligations to repair replace andor supplement additional modules and balance of system materials for the project particularly if our liabilities are not capped under the terms of such agreement and we typically will not be able to recover our investment in the project some of these penalties might require us to repurchase the project from the buyer or to downsize the project under certain circumstances if we were required to repurchase a project we may have insufficient cash or capital resources necessary to make the repurchase payment or we may be unable to resell the project in a timely manner or on terms commercially satisfactory to us which would adversely impact our results of operations some of these investments are included as assets on our consolidated balance sheet under the line item “project assets” if we are unable to complete the development of a solar power project we may writedown or writeoff some or all of these capitalized investments which would have an adverse impact on our net income in the period in which 

the loss is recognized in 2012 we expect to invest a significant amount of capital to develop projects owned by us or third parties which may limit the availability of capital to use for other purposes such as contract damages or repurchase payments 

we may enter into fixedprice epc contracts in which we act as the general contractor for our customers in connection with the installation of their solar power systems all essential costs are estimated at the time of entering into the epc contract for a particular project and these are reflected in the overall fixedprice that we charge our customers for the project these cost estimates are preliminary and may or may not be covered by contracts between us or the subcontractors suppliers and other parties to the project in addition we require qualified licensed subcontractors to install most of our systems shortages of such skilled labor could significantly delay a project or otherwise increase our costs should miscalculations in planning a project occur including those due to unexpected increases in inflation commodity prices or labor costs or delays in execution occur and we are unable to increase commensurately the epc sales price we may not achieve our expected margins or we may be required to record a loss in the relevant fiscal period 

we may be unable to acquire or lease land obtain necessary interconnection and transmission rights andor obtain the approvals licenses permits and electric transmission grid interconnection and transmission rights necessary to build and operate pv power plants in a timely and cost effective manner and regulatory agencies local communities labor unions or other third parties may delay prevent or increase the cost of construction and operation of the pv plants we intend to build 

in order to construct and operate our pv plants we need to acquire or lease land and rights of way obtain interconnection rights and obtain all necessary local county state federal and foreign approvals licenses and permits as well as rights to interconnect the plants to the transmission grid and transmit energy generated from the plant we may be unable to acquire the land or lease interests needed may not obtain satisfactory interconnection rights may not receive or retain the requisite approvals permits licenses and interconnection and transmission rights or may encounter other problems which could delay or prevent us from successfully constructing and operating pv plants 

  

many of our proposed pv plants are located on or require access through public lands administered by federal and state agencies pursuant to competitive public leasing and rightofway procedures and processes the authorization for the use construction and operation of pv plants and associated transmission facilities on federal state and private lands will also require the assessment and evaluation of mineral rights private rightsofway and other easements environmental agricultural cultural recreational and aesthetic impacts and the likely mitigation of adverse impacts to these and other resources and uses the inability to obtain the required permits and potentially excessive delay in obtaining such permits due for example to litigation or third party appeals could prevent us from successfully constructing and operating pv plants in a timely manner and could result in a potential forfeiture of any deposit we have made with respect to a given project moreover project approvals subject to project modifications and conditions including mitigation requirements and costs could affect the financial success of a given project 

in addition local labor unions may increase the cost of andor lower the productivity of project development in canada california and elsewhere we may also be subject to labor unavailability andor increased union labor requirements due to multiple simultaneous projects in a geographic region 

lack of transmission capacity availability potential upgrade costs to the transmission grid and other systems constraints could significantly impact our ability to build pv plants and generate solar electricity power sales 

  

in order to deliver electricity from our pv plants to our customers our projects generally need to connect to the transmission grid the lack of available capacity on the transmission grid could substantially impact our projects and cause reductions in project size delays in project implementation increases in costs from transmission upgrades and potential forfeitures of any deposit we have made with respect to a given project these transmission issues as well as issues relating to the availability of large systems such as transformers and switch gear could significantly impact our ability to build pv plants and generate solar electricity sales 

  

our systems business is largely dependent on us and third parties arranging financing from various sources which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms or in insufficient amounts 

  

the construction of the large utilityscale solar power projects under development by us is expected in many cases to require project financing including nonrecourse project debt financing in the bank loan market and institutional debt capital markets uncertainties exist as to whether our projects will be able to access the debt markets in a magnitude sufficient to finance their construction if we are unable to arrange such financing or if it is only available on unfavorable terms we may be unable to fully execute our systems business plan in addition we generally expect to sell our projects by raising project equity capital from tax oriented strategic industry and other equity investors such equity sources may not be available or may only be available in insufficient amounts in which case our ability to sell our projects may be delayed or limited and our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected even if such financing sources are available the counterparty to many of our 

fixedprice epc contracts which own the project we are constructing are often special purpose vehicles that do not have significant assets other than their interests in the project and have pledged all or substantially all of these assets to secure the projectrelated debt and certain other sources of financing if the owner defaults on its payment or other obligations to us we may face difficulties in collecting payment of amounts due to us for the costs previously incurred or for the amounts previously expended or committed to be expended to purchase equipment or supplies including intercompany purchases of pv modules or for termination payments we are entitled to under the terms of the related epc contract if we are unable to collect the amounts owed to us or are unable to complete the project because of an owner default we may be required to record a charge against earnings related to the project which could result in a material loss 

  

in addition for projects to which we provide epc services but are not the project developer our epc activities are in many cases dependent on the ability of third parties to finance their pv plant projects which in turn is dependent on their ability to obtain financing for such purchases on acceptable terms depending on prevailing conditions in the credit markets interest rates and other factors such financing may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms or in insufficient amounts if third parties are limited in their ability to access financing to support their purchase of pv power plant construction services from us we may not realize the cash flows that we expect from such sales and this could adversely affect our ability to invest in our business andor generate revenue see also the risk factor above entitled “an increase in interest rates or lending rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets including a reduction in total tax equity availability could make it difficult for endusers to finance the cost of a pv system and could reduce the demand for our solar modules andor lead to a reduction in the average selling price for pv modules  ” 

  

developing solar power projects may require significant upfront investment prior to the signing of an epc contract and commencing construction which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

our solar power project development cycles which span the time between the identification of land and the commercial operation of a pv power plant project vary substantially and can take many months or years to mature as a result of these long project cycles we may need to make significant upfront investments of resources including for example payments for land rights large transmission and ppa deposits or other payments which may be nonrefundable in advance of the signing of epc contracts and commencing construction and the receipt of any revenue much of which is not recognized for several additional months or years following contract signing our potential inability to enter into sales contracts with potential customers after making such upfront investments could adversely affect our business and results of operations furthermore we may become constrained in our ability to simultaneously fund our other business operations and these systems investments through our long project development cycles 

our liquidity may be adversely affected to the extent the project sale market weakens and we are unable to sell our solar projects on pricing terms and timing commercially acceptable to us 

we may not be able to obtain longterm contracts for the sale of power produced by our projects at prices and on other terms favorable to attract financing and other investments 

obtaining longterm contracts for the sale of power produced by the projects at prices and on other terms favorable to us is essential for obtaining financing and commencing construction of our projects we must compete for power purchase agreements against other developers of solar and renewable energy projects further other sources of power such as natural gasfired power plants have historically been cheaper than the cost of solar power and power from certain types of projects such as natural gasfired power plants can be delivered on a firm basis the inability to compete successfully against other power producers or otherwise enter into ppas favorable to us would negatively affect our ability to develop and finance our projects and negatively impact our revenue in addition the availability of power purchase agreements is a function of a number of economic regulatory tax and public policy factors 

we may be subject to unforeseen costs liabilities or obligations when providing om services 

for solar power plants which we have developed and built we may provide ongoing om services to the system owner under fixedprice longterm service agreements pursuant to which we generally perform all scheduled and unscheduled maintenance for the system perform operating and other asset management services for the system and provide an availability guarantee for the system our costs to perform these services are estimated at the time of entering into the om agreement for a particular project and these are reflected in the fixedprice that we charge our customers under the om agreement we do not have extensive experience in performing om services for pv solar power plants and estimating actual costs to serve under our om agreements relative to the price that we charge our customers particularly in foreign jurisdictions in which we plan to offer pv systems solutions as part of our long term strategic plan should miscalculations in estimating these costs occur including those due to unexpected increases in inflation or labor or bos costs our growth strategy and results of operations could be 

adversely affected because of the longterm nature of these om agreements such as 25 years such adverse impacts on results of operations could be significant particularly if our liabilities are not capped or subject to an abovemarket liability cap under the terms of the om agreement we also could be subject to substantial costs liabilities or obligations in the event our solar systems do not meet any agreedupon systemlevel availability or performance warranties 

other risks 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions and integration of these acquisitions may disrupt our business and management 

we have made several acquisitions in the last several years and in the future we may acquire additional companies project pipelines products or technologies or enter into joint ventures or other strategic initiatives we may not realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition and each acquisition has numerous risks these risks include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

mergers and acquisitions of companies are inherently risky and ultimately if we do not complete the integration of acquired businesses successfully and in a timely manner we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions to the extent anticipated which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our future success depends on our ability to retain our key associates and to successfully integrate them into our management team 

we are dependent on the services of our executive officers and other members of our senior management team the loss of one or more of these key associates or any other member of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on us we may not be able to retain or replace these key associates and we may not have adequate succession plans in place several of our current key associates including our executive officers are subject to employment conditions or arrangements that contain 

postemployment noncompetition provisions however these arrangements permit the associates to terminate their employment with us upon little or no notice and the enforceability of the noncompetition provisions is uncertain 

if we are unable to attract train and retain key personnel our business may be materially and adversely affected 

our future success depends to a significant extent on our ability to attract train and retain management operations and technical personnel including in foreign jurisdictions as we continue to execute on our long term strategic plan recruiting and retaining capable personnel particularly those with expertise in the pv industry and thinfilm technology are vital to our success there is substantial competition for qualified technical personnel and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain our technical personnel if we are unable to attract and retain qualified associates or otherwise experience labor disruptions our business may be materially and adversely affected 

certain types of services provided by onsite workers at certain of our solar projects under construction are subject to the davisbacon act the davisbacon act requires that a contractor pay all personnel assigned to the contract at least the prevailing wage and fringe benefits as established by and in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the us department of labor “dol” we have an established policy pursuant to which we evaluate davisbacon act requirements and ensure our compliance with these requirements if the dol were to ultimately determine that anyone working under such contracts were not properly classified or were being paid the incorrect prevailing wage we could incur additional liability with respect to such workers for example the agua caliente project we are constructing is currently undergoing a dol davisbacon act compliance review for which the ultimate outcome is uncertain any such liability incurred above our anticipated costs for these services could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we may be exposed to infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties which if determined adversely to us could cause us to pay significant damage awards or prohibit us from the manufacture and sale of our solar modules or the use of our technology 

our success depends largely on our ability to use and develop our technology and knowhow without infringing or misappropriating the intellectual property rights of third parties the validity and scope of claims relating to pv technology patents involve complex scientific legal and factual considerations and analysis and therefore may be highly uncertain we may be subject to litigation involving claims of patent infringement or violation of intellectual property rights of third parties the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits patent opposition proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings can be both costly and time consuming and may significantly divert the efforts and resources of our technical and management personnel an adverse determination in any such litigation or proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liability to third parties require us to seek licenses from third parties which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all or pay ongoing royalties require us to redesign our solar module or subject us to injunctions prohibiting the manufacture and sale of our solar modules or the use of our technologies protracted litigation could also result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of our solar modules until the resolution of such litigation 

currency translation and transaction risk may negatively affect our net sales cost of sales and gross margins and could result in exchange losses 

although our reporting currency is the us dollar we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most countries in which we operate as a result we are subject to currency translation and transaction risk for example 4  and 43  of our net sales were denominated in euros for the years ended december 31 2012  and december 31 2011  respectively and we expect more than a minor percentage of our net sales to be outside the united states and denominated in foreign currencies in the future in addition our operating expenses for our manufacturing plants located outside the us and our operations for our systems business in foreign countries will generally be denominated in the local currency changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar could affect our net sales and cost of sales and could result in exchange gains or losses we cannot accurately predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations 

we could also expand our business into emerging markets many of which have an uncertain regulatory environment relating to currency policy conducting business in such emerging markets could cause our exposure to changes in exchange rates to increase 

our ability to hedge foreign currency exposure is dependent on our credit profile with the banks that are willing and able to do business with us deterioration in our credit position or a significant tightening of the credit market conditions could limit our ability to hedge our foreign currency exposure and therefore result in exchange gains or losses 

the ongoing sovereign debt problems in europe could adversely impact our business 

the ongoing sovereign debt problems in europe and its impact on the balance sheets and lending practices of european banks in particular could negatively impact our access to and cost of capital and therefore could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and competitive position it could also similarly affect our customers and therefore limit the sales of our modules and demand for our systems business as well the european sovereign debt problems may also cause european governments to reduce eliminate or allow to expire government subsidies and economic incentives for solar energy which could limit our growth or cause our net sales to decline and materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to litigation risks including securities class actions and stockholder derivative actions which may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain 

from time to time we are subject to legal claims with and without merit that may be costly and which may divert the attention of our management and our resources in general the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict moreover many of the complaints filed against us do not specify the amount of damages that plaintiffs seek and we therefore are unable to estimate the possible range of damages that might be incurred should these lawsuits be resolved against us certain of these lawsuits assert types of claims that if resolved against us could give rise to substantial damages and an unfavorable outcome or settlement of one or more of these lawsuits or any future lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations even if these lawsuits or any future lawsuits are not resolved against us the costs of defending such lawsuits may be costly and may not be covered by our insurance policies because the price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile we can provide no assurance that additional securities litigation will not be filed against us in the future for more information on our legal proceedings see part i item 3 “legal proceedings” of this report and note 17 “commitments and contingencies  legal proceedings” to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 

our largest stockholder has significant control over us and its interests may conflict with or differ from interests of other stockholders 

our largest stockholder consisting collectively of jcl fslr holdings llc and its beneficiaries and jtw trust no 1 uad 91902 and its beneficiaries each affiliated in the past with the former estate of john t walton collectively the significant stockholder owned approximately 30  of our outstanding common stock at december 31 2012  as a result the significant stockholder has substantial influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of our directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions such as mergers tender offers and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets the interests of the significant stockholder could conflict with or differ from interests of other stockholders for example the concentration of ownership held by the significant stockholder could delay defer or prevent a change of control of our company or impede a merger takeover or other business combination which a majority of stockholders may view favorably 

if our goodwill or project assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 

we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements should we determine that our goodwill or project assets are impaired such a charge might have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations for example during the fourth quarter of 2011 we recorded goodwill impairment expense of 3934 million  related to our components reporting unit as discussed further in note 6 “goodwill and intangible assets”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2012  included in this annual report on form 10k 

  

as required by accounting rules we review our goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill is less than its carrying value factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill might not be recoverable include a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant decline in projections of future cash flows and lower future growth rates in our industry 

we review project assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable we consider a project commercially viable and recoverable if it is anticipated to be sellable for a profit once it is either fully developed or fully constructed if our projects are not considered commercially viable we would be required to impair the respective project assets 

unanticipated changes in our tax provisions the adoption of a new us tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate our tax liabilities are 

affected by the amounts we charge for inventory services licenses funding and other items in intercompany transactions we are subject to potential tax examinations in these various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges crossjurisdictional transfer pricing or other tax positions and assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these examinations in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision in accordance with asc 740 income taxes  however there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these potential examinations and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of examinations could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows in addition our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure loss of our malaysian tax holiday changes in the mix of earnings in countries with tax holidays or differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process in addition recently announced proposals for new us tax legislation could have a material effect on the results of our operations if enacted 

our credit agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business 

we may be unable to respond to changes in business and economic conditions engage in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us and obtain additional financing if needed because our revolving credit facility and our malaysian facility agreements contain and any of our other future debt agreements may contain covenant restrictions that limit our ability to among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

under our revolving credit facility and our malaysian facility agreements we are also subject to certain financial covenants our ability to comply with covenants under our credit agreements is dependent on our future performance which will be subject to many factors some of which are beyond our control including prevailing economic conditions in addition our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under these agreements and any of our other future debt agreements which if not cured or waived could permit the holders thereof to accelerate such debt and could cause crossdefaults under our other facility agreements and the possible acceleration of debt under such other facility agreements as well as crossdefaults under certain of our key project and operational agreements in addition we cannot assure you that events that occur within the company or in the industry or the economy as a whole will not constitute material adverse effects under these agreements if it is determined that a material adverse effect has occurred the lenders can under certain circumstances restrict future borrowings or accelerate the due date of outstanding loan balances if any of our debt is accelerated we may in the future not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt and we may experience crossdefaults under our other debt agreements or project and key operational agreements which could materially and negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in the ordinary conduct of our business we are subject to periodic lawsuits investigations and claims including but not limited to routine employment matters although we cannot predict with certainty the ultimate resolution of lawsuits investigations and claims asserted against us we do not believe that any currently pending legal proceeding to which we are a party to will have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

on september 23 2011 the company informed the staff of the securities and exchange commission the “sec” that the company was commencing an internal investigation regarding a possible violation of regulation fd the possible violation arose in connection with disclosures on september 21 2011 relating to the failure of the topaz solar farm project to meet the statutory deadline to receive a federal loan guarantee from the us department of energy this internal investigation was conducted on behalf of the company’s board of directors by independent outside counsel following completion of the internal investigation the company appointed a new vice president of investor relations the sec pursuant to an order dated november 17 2011 commenced an investigation into the matter and the company has cooperated with the sec during the course of its investigation 

class action 

on march 15 2012 a purported class action lawsuit titled smilovits v first solar inc et al  case no 212cv00555dgc was filed in the united states district court for the district of arizona hereafter “arizona district court” against the company and certain of our current and former directors and officers the complaint was filed on behalf of purchasers of the company’s securities between april 30 2008 and february 28 2012 the complaint generally alleges that the defendants violated sections 10b and 20a of the securities exchange act of 1934 by making false and misleading statements regarding the company’s financial performance and prospects the action includes claims for damages and an award of costs and expenses to the putative class including attorneys’ fees 

on july 23 2012 the arizona district court issued an order appointing as lead plaintiffs in the class action the mineworkers’ pension scheme and british coal staff superannuation scheme collectively “pension schemes” the pension schemes filed an amended complaint on august 17 2012 which contains similar allegations and seeks similar relief as the original complaint defendants filed a motion to dismiss on september 14 2012 on december 17 2012 the court denied the motion to dismiss defendants answered the complaint on january 29 2013 

the action is still in the initial stages and there has been no discovery accordingly we are not in a position to assess whether any loss or adverse effect on our financial condition is probable or remote or to estimate the range of potential loss if any the company believes it has meritorious defenses and will vigorously defend this action 

derivative actions 

on april 3 2012 a derivative action titled tsevegmid v ahearn et al  case no 112cv00417cjb   was filed by a putative stockholder on behalf of the company in the united states district court for the district of delaware hereafter “delaware district court” against certain current and former directors and officers of the company alleging breach of fiduciary duties and unjust enrichment the complaint generally alleges that from june 1 2008 to march 7 2012 the defendants caused or allowed false and misleading statements to be made concerning the company’s financial performance and prospects the action includes claims for among other things damages in favor of the company certain corporate actions to purportedly improve the company’s corporate governance and an award of costs and expenses to the putative plaintiff stockholder including attorneys’ fees on april 10 2012 a second derivative complaint was filed in the delaware district court the action titled brownlee v ahearn et al case no 112cv00456cjb contains similar allegations and seeks similar relief to the tsevegmid  action by court order on april 30 2012 pursuant to the parties’ stipulation the tsevegmid action and the brownlee  action were consolidated into a single action in the delaware district court on may 15 2012 defendants filed a motion challenging delaware as the appropriate venue for the consolidated action the court has not yet ruled on that motion 

 on april 12 2012 a derivative complaint was filed in the arizona district court titled tindall v ahearn et al  case no 212cv00769ros in addition to alleging claims and seeking relief similar to the claims and relief asserted in the tsevegmid and brownlee  actions the tindall  complaint alleges violations of sections 14a and 20b of the securities exchange act of 1934 on april 19 2012 a second derivative complaint was filed in the arizona district court titled nederhood v ahearn et al  case no 212cv00819jws the nederhood  complaint contains similar allegations and seeks similar relief to the tsevegmid and   brownlee  actions on may 17 2012 and may 30 2012 respectively two additional derivative complaints containing similar allegations and seeking similar relief as the nederhood  complaint were filed in arizona district court morris v ahearn et al case no 212cv01031jat and tan v ahearn et al 212cv01144nvw 

on july 17 2012 the arizona district court issued an order granting first solar’s motion to transfer the derivative actions to judge david campbell the judge to whom the smilovits  class action is assigned on august 8 2012 the court consolidated the four derivative actions pending in arizona district court and on august 31 2012 plaintiffs filed an amended complaint defendants filed a motion to stay the action on september 14 2012 on december 17 2012 the court granted defendants motion to stay the action pending resolution of the smilovits class action 

first solar believes that plaintiffs in the derivative actions lack standing to pursue litigation on behalf of first solar the actions are still in the initial stages and there has been no discovery accordingly we are not in a position to assess whether any loss or adverse effect on our financial condition is probable or remote or to estimate the range of potential loss if any

unit of power 

when referring to our manufacturing capacity total sales and components sales the unit of electricity in watts for megawatts “mw” and gigawatts “gw” is direct current “dc” unless otherwise noted when referring to our solar power systems the unit of electricity in watts for mw and gw is alternating current “ac” unless otherwise noted 

overview 

we are a premium global provider of solar energy solutions we manufacture and sell photovoltaic “pv” solar modules with an advanced thinfilm semiconductor technology and we design construct and sell pv solar power systems that use the solar modules we manufacture we are the world’s largest thinfilm pv solar module manufacturer and one of the world’s largest pv solar module manufacturers 

in addressing overall global demand for pv solar electricity we have developed a differentiated fully integrated systems business that can provide a competitively priced turnkey utilityscale pv system solution for system owners and competitively priced electricity to utility endusers our fully integrated systems business which uses the solar modules we manufacture has enabled us to increase module throughput drive cost reduction across the value chain identify and break constraints to sustainable markets and deliver compelling solutions to our customers and endusers with our fully integrated systems business we believe we are in a position to expand our business in economically sustainable markets in which support programs are minimal which are developing in areas with abundant solar resources and sizable electricity demand we are committed to continually lowering the cost of solar electricity and in the long term we plan to compete on an economic basis with conventional fossilfuelbased peaking power generation 

in furtherance of our goal of delivering affordable solar electricity we are continually focused on reducing pv solar system costs in four primary areas module manufacturing balance of systems “bos” costs consisting of the costs of the components of a solar power system other than the solar modules such as inverters mounting hardware trackers grid interconnection equipment wiring and other devices and installation labor costs project development costs and the cost of capital first with respect to our module manufacturing costs our advanced technology has allowed us to reduce our average module manufacturing costs to among the lowest in the world for modules produced on a commercial scale based on publicly available information in 2012  our total average manufacturing costs were 073  per watt which is competitive on a comparable basis with those of traditional crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers based on publicly available information by continuing to improve conversion efficiency production line throughput and lower material costs we believe that we can further reduce our manufacturing costs per watt and maintain cost competitiveness with traditional crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers second with respect to our bos cost reduction roadmap we have aggressive programs which target key improvements in components and system design which when combined with continued improvements in conversion efficiency volume procurement around standardized hardware platforms use of innovative installation techniques and know how and accelerated installation times are expected to result in substantial reductions to our bos costs enabling a lower system levelized cost of energy third with respect to our project development costs we seek optimal site locations in an effort to minimize transmission and permitting costs and to accelerate lead times to electricity generation finally with respect to the cost of capital by continuing to demonstrate the financial viability and operational performance of our utilityscale pv solar power plants and increasing our pv solar power system operating experience we believe we can continue to lower the cost of capital associated with our pv solar power systems thereby further enhancing the economic viability of our projects and lowering the cost of electricity generated by pv solar power systems that incorporate our modules and technology 

we believe that combining our reliable lowcost module manufacturing capability with our systems business enables us to more rapidly reduce the price of solar electricity accelerate the adoption of our technology in utilityscale pv solar power systems and identify and remove constraints to the successful migration to sustainable solar markets around the world our vertically integrated capabilities enable us to maximize value and mitigate risk for our customers and thereby deliver meaningful pv energy solutions to varied energy problems worldwide we offer leadership across the entire solar value chain resulting in more reliable and cost effective pv energy solutions for our customers and furthering our mission to create enduring value by enabling a world powered by clean affordable solar electricity 

we operate our business in two segments our components segment involves the design manufacture and sale of solar modules which convert sunlight into electricity thirdparty customers of our components segment include project developers system integrators and operators of renewable energy projects 

our second segment is our fully integrated systems business “systems segment” through which we provide complete turnkey pv solar power systems or solar solutions that draw upon our capabilities which include i project development ii engineering procurement and construction “epc” services iii operating and maintenance “om” services and iv project finance expertise all as described in more detail below we may provide our full epc services or any combination of individual products and services within our epc capabilities depending upon the customer and market opportunity all of our systems segment products and services are for pv solar power systems which use our solar modules and such products and services are sold directly to investor owned utilities independent power developers and producers commercial and industrial companies and other system owners 

market overview 

the solar industry experienced a challenging environment in 2012 categorized by intense pricing competition both at the pv module and system level with many solar companies generating little or no operating income in the aggregate manufacturers of solar modules and cells have installed production capacity that significantly exceeds global demand we believe this structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity significantly exceeds current global demand may continue for the foreseeable future and we expect it will continue to put pressure on pricing and our results of operations in 2013 we further believe that this structural imbalance will remain unfavorable for solar companies that are primarily module manufacturers but that companies with established expertise and meaningful solutions in other areas of the solar value chain such as project development epc capabilities and om services are more likely to develop economically sustainable businesses in light of such market realities we continue to execute on our long term strategic plan described below under which we are focusing on our competitive strengths a key core strength is our differentiated vertically integrated business model that enables us to provide utilityscale pv generation solutions to sustainable geographic markets that have an immediate need for massscale pv electricity 

the development of solar markets worldwide continued throughout 2012 in part aided by demand elasticity resulting from declining industry average selling prices both at the pv module and system level which makes solar power more affordable to 

new markets and we have continued to develop our localized presence and expertise in these markets in the united arab emirates we announced in october 2012 that we were selected by the dubai electricity  water authority “dewa” to construct a 13 mw ac pv power plant near dubai in india we announced in october 2012 the entry into an agreement to supply first solar modules to two pv power plants totaling 50 mw dc to be constructed in india’s rajasthan state in australia first solar verve energy and ge energy financial services officially began commercial operation in october 2012 of a first solar built 10 mw ac plant that will help power the southern seawater desalination plant in western australia in china we announced in september 2012 the appointment of a country head to lead business development in china with responsibility for expanding the market for utilityscale solar pv power plants using our modules in that country and in december 2012 we announced a collaboration with zhenfa new energy science  technology co ltd to supply 2 mw of our modules in 2013 to one of zhenfa’s approved solar projects in china as part of our first commercial demonstration project in china in thailand we announced in august 2012 the establishment of a thai operating subsidiary and the opening of an office in bangkok to enable first solar to execute its strategy and pursue opportunities for utility‐scale pv power plants in the local market in south africa we announced in december 2012 the appointment of a director of business development for subsaharan africa in our newly established office in cape town in chile we announced in january 2013 our acquisition of solar chile a santiagobased solar development company with a portfolio of early to midstage utilityscale pv power projects totaling approximately 15 gw in northern chile including the atacama desert region which offers among the highest solar irradiance in the world 

  

in north america we continue to execute on our advance stage utilityscale systems pipeline we continue to make construction progress on what will be among the world’s four largest solar pv power plants the 550 mw ac topaz solar farm located in san luis obispo county california the 550 mw ac desert sunlight solar farm located west of blythe california the 290 mw ac agua caliente project in yuma county arizona and the 230 mw ac antelope valley solar ranch one project “avsr1” located just north of los angeles california the agua caliente project is currently the largest operating pv power plant in the world and has achieved a peak generating capacity of more than 250 mw ac while connected to the electrical grid we expect a substantial portion of our consolidated net sales operating income and cash flows through 2014 to be derived from these four projects we continue to advance the development and selling efforts for the other projects included in our advanced stage systems pipeline and we continue to evaluate additions to such pipeline in september 2012 we announced execution of power purchase agreements with pacific gas and electric company “pge” for 72 mw ac of solar electricity to be generated at two pv power plants that first solar is developing in central california the 32 mw ac lost hills project in kern county and the 40 mw ac cuyama project in santa barbara county in september 2012 we also announced the entry into agreements to construct four solar power plants totaling up to 22 mw ac in new mexico for pnm resources inc in january 2013 we announced that we started constructing the 139 mw ac campo verde solar project located near el centro in imperial county california we also announced in january 2013 our acquisition of the 50 mw ac macho springs solar project in luna county new mexico which will be the state’s largest solar power project when completed 

     

in 2012 industry average module pricing continued to decline as competitors reduced prices to sellthrough inventories worldwide lower industry module pricing while currently challenging for solar manufacturers particularly manufacturers with high cost structures is expected to continue to contribute to global market diversification and volume elasticity over time declining average selling prices are consistent with the erosion of one of the primary historical constraints to widespread solar market penetration its affordability in the near term however in light of industrywide manufacturing capacity that exceeds demand it is uncertain whether growing worldwide demand can absorb industrywide module supply without further inventory buildup andor price reductions which could adversely affect our results of operations if competitors reduce module pricing to levels below their manufacturing costs or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time our results of operations could be further adversely affected we continue to mitigate this uncertainty in part by executing on and building our utilityscale systems pipeline as a buffer against demand fluctuations accelerating our module efficiency improvements and cost reduction roadmaps to maintain and increase our competitiveness profitability and capital efficiency adjusting our production plans and capacity utilization to match our expected demand and continuing the development of worldwide geographic markets including those in india australia the middle east latin america and china 

  

in the components business we continue to face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules and other types of solar modules and pv systems solar module manufacturers compete with one another in several product performance attributes including reliability and selling price per watt and with respect to solar power systems return on equity “roe” and levelized cost of electricity “lcoe” meaning the net present value of total life cycle costs of the solar power project divided by the quantity of energy which is expected to be produced over the system’s life we are among the lowest cost pv module manufacturers in the solar industry based on publicly available information this cost competitiveness is reflected in the price at which we sell our modules and fully integrated systems and enables our systems to compete favorably in respect of their roe or lcoe our cost competitiveness is based in large part on our proprietary technology which enables conversion efficiency improvements and enables us to produce a module in less than 25 hours using a continuous and highly automated industrial manufacturing process as opposed to a batch process our scale and our operational excellence in addition our modules 

use approximately 12 of the amount of semiconductor material ie silicon that is used to manufacture traditional crystalline silicon solar modules the cost of polysilicon is a significant driver of the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules and the timing and rate of change in the cost of silicon feedstock and polysilicon could lead to changes in solar module pricing levels polysilicon costs have declined over the past several years contributing to a decline in our manufacturing cost competitiveness over crystalline silicon module manufacturers given the lower conversion efficiency of our modules compared to many types of crystalline silicon modules there may be higher bos costs associated with systems using our modules thus to compete effectively on the basis of lcoe our modules need to maintain a certain cost advantage per watt compared to crystalline siliconbased modules with higher conversion efficiencies we continue to reduce bos costs associated with systems using our modules we believe we can continue to reduce bos costs by improving conversion efficiency leveraging volume procurement around standardized hardware platforms using innovative installation techniques and know how and accelerating installation times bos costs can represent a significant portion of the costs associated with the construction of a typical utilityscale pv solar power system 

while our modules are currently competing in these product performance attributes there can be no guarantee such competitiveness will continue to exist in the future to the same extent or at all any declines in the competitiveness of our products could result in additional margin compression further declines in the average selling prices of our solar modules erosion in our market share for modules decreases in the rate of net sales growth andor declines in overall net sales we have taken and continue to take various actions to mitigate the potential impact resulting from competitive pressures including adjusting our pricing policies as necessary accelerating progress along our module and bos cost reduction roadmaps and focusing our research and development on increasing the conversion efficiency of our solar modules 

  

as we continue to expand our systems business into sustainable markets we can offer value beyond the solar module reduce our exposure to moduleonly competition provide differentiated product offerings to minimize the impact of solar module commoditization and provide comprehensive utilityscale pv systems solutions that significantly reduce solar electricity costs thus our systems business allows us to play a more active role than many of our competitors in managing the demand for our solar modules finally we continue to form and develop strong partner relationships with our customers around the world and continue to develop our range of product offerings including epc capabilities and om services in order to enhance the competitiveness of systems using our solar modules 

certain trends and uncertainties 

we believe that our continuing operations may be favorably or unfavorably impacted by the following trends and uncertainties that may affect our financial condition and results of operations see “risk factors” in part i item 1a and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k for a discussion of other risks that may affect our financial condition and results of operations 

long term strategic plan 

in may 2012 we provided information regarding our long term strategic plan “long term strategic plan” or “ltsp” to transition to primarily sustainable opportunities by the end of 2016 in executing the ltsp we are focusing on providing solar pv generation solutions using our modules to sustainable geographic markets that we believe have a compelling need for massscale pv electricity including markets throughout the americas asia the middle east and africa as part of our ltsp we are focusing on opportunities in which our solar pv generation solutions will compete over time directly with fossil fuel offerings on a levelized cost of energy basis execution of the ltsp will entail a reallocation of resources around the globe in particular dedicating resources to regions such as latin america asia the middle east and africa where we have not traditionally conducted significant business to date we will evaluate and manage closely the appropriate level of resources required as we transition into and penetrate these specific markets we intend to dedicate significant capital and human resources to reduce the total installed cost of solar pv generation to optimize the design and logistics around our solar pv generation solutions and to ensure that our solutions integrate well into the overall electricity ecosystem of each specific region 

we expect that over time an increasing portion of our consolidated net sales operating income and cash flows will come from solar offerings in the sustainable markets described above as we execute on our long term strategic plan and that over time larger relative contributions to our overall financial performance may come from systems offerings in comparison to module only sales the timing execution and financial impacts of our long term strategic plan are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the “risk factors” in part i item 1a and elsewhere in this report 

we are focusing our resources in those markets and energy applications in which solar power can be a leastcost bestfit energy solution particularly in regions with high solar resources significant current or projected electricity demand andor relatively high existing electricity prices as part of these efforts we are expanding resources globally including by appointing country heads and supporting professional sales and other staff in target markets accordingly we expect to shift current costs and incur 

additional costs over time as we establish a localized business presence in these regions 

we expect joint ventures or other business arrangements with strategic partners to be a key part of our strategy and we have begun initiatives in several markets to expedite our penetration of those markets and establish relationships with potential customers and policymakers some of these business arrangements are expected to involve investments or other allocations of capital on our part we are in the process of developing relationships with policymakers regulators and especially end customers in each of these markets with a view to creating markets for utility scale pv solar power systems we sell solar power solutions that include our modules directly to end customers including independent power producers utilities retail electric providers and commercial and industrial customers depending on the market opportunity our sales offerings range from third party moduleonly sales to module sales with a range of engineering procurement and construction products and solutions to full turnkey solar power system sales we expect these sales offerings to continue to evolve over time as we work with our customers to optimize how our pv solar power solutions can best meet our customers’ energy and economic needs   

in order to create or maintain a market position in certain strategically targeted markets our offerings from time to time may need to be priced at levels associated with minimal gross profit margins which may adversely affect our results of operations 

we expect the profitability associated with our various sales offerings to vary from one another over time and possibly vary from our internal longrange profitability expectations and targets depending on the market opportunity and the relative competitiveness of our offering compared with other energy solutions fossil fuel based or otherwise that are available to potential customers 

construction of some of the world’s largest solar pv power plants 

we expect a substantial portion of our consolidated net sales operating income and cash flows through 2014 to be derived from the following four projects in north america which will be among the world’s four largest solar pv power plants the 550 mw ac topaz solar farm located in san luis obispo county california the 550 mw ac desert sunlight solar farm located west of blythe california the 290 mw ac agua caliente project located in yuma county arizona and the 230 mw ac avsr1 project located just north of los angeles california please see the tables under “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsfinancial operations overviewnet salessystems business” for additional information about these and other projects within our systems business advanced stage project pipeline construction progress of these projects is subject to risks and delays as described in the “risk factors” in part i item 1a and elsewhere in this report revenue recognition for these projects is in many cases not linear in nature due to the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria have been or will be met and consequently period over period comparisons of results of operations may not be meaningful as we progress towards substantial completion of our four largest pv power plants under construction which is expected to occur in 2013 through 2015 we expect to have a larger portion of our net sales operating income and cash flows come from future sales of solar offerings outside of north america pursuant to our long term strategic plan described above north america however will continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales operating income and cash flows as a significant portion of our advance stage project pipeline after excluding the four projects above is comprised of projects in north america 

manufacturing capacity 

as of december 31 2012  we had 28  installed production lines with an annual global manufacturing capacity of approximately 19  gw at our manufacturing plants in perrysburg ohio and kulim malaysia our manufacturing operations in frankfurt oder germany closed at the end of 2012 production at one or more of our manufacturing plants has and may in the future be idled temporarily to better align production with expected market demand and to allow us to implement upgraded process technologies as part of our conversion efficiency improvement initiatives 

20082009 manufacturing excursion 

during the period from june 2008 to june 2009 a manufacturing excursion occurred whereby certain modules manufactured during that time period may experience premature power loss once installed in the field the root cause of the manufacturing excursion was identified and addressed in june 2009 beginning in 2009 we initiated a voluntary remediation program beyond our standard limited warranty pursuant to which we made commitments to customers with systems containing modules manufactured during the relevant period that we would cover certain costs of remediation efforts these remediation efforts included module removal replacement and logistical services and additional compensation payments to customers under certain circumstances our best estimate for costs of our voluntary remediation program as of and in each fiscal period in question has been based on evaluation and consideration of the thencurrently available information including the estimated number of affected modules in the field historical experience related to our voluntary remediation efforts customerprovided data related to potentially affected systems and the estimated costs of performing the logistical services covered under our remediation program 

as we continued remediation efforts under our voluntary remediation program we learned that in light of the impracticality of identifying and replacing individual affected models in order to remediate the energy loss impact at a system level we are required to remove and replace several modules in the aggregate including modules that might not have been affected by the manufacturing excursion removed modules are returned to us and are further tested to determine if the module can be resold or whether the module should be recycled 

we have expensed 2712 million total through december 31 2012 for the estimated costs of remediating systems affected by modules manufactured during the relevant period including 1785 million for remediation expenses beyond our limited warranty obligations and 927 million in product warranty expense reflecting the net increase in the expected number of replacement modules required in connection with our remediation efforts 

        as part of our overall remediation strategy we have reached commercial settlements with impacted customers mostly during the fourth quarter of 2012 and we expect to reach additional commercial settlements in the future such commercial settlements typically include us making a cash payment to a customer in lieu of actually remediating the customer’s affected sites and in exchange the customer agrees that no further claims against us related to the manufacturing excursion can be made the commercial settlements are beneficial to our customers as they benefit from a timely and fair settlement of their claims and we are able to eliminate the risk of uncertainty related to the ultimate cost of actual remediation efforts associated with identifying and replacing individual modules 

 for additional information regarding accrued expenses in excess of normal product warranty liability and related expenses see note 9 “consolidated balance sheet details”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k our voluntary remediation program and the related manufacturing excursion also resulted in changes in estimates to our product warranty liability for additional information regarding these changes see note 17 “commitments and contingencies”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

restructuring 

we have undertaken a series of restructuring initiatives as further described in note 4 “restructuring”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k in december 2011 february 2012 and april 2012 respectively we announced restructuring initiatives intended to i align the organization with our long term strategic plan including expected sustainable market opportunities ii accelerate operating cost reductions and improve overall operating efficiency and iii better align production capacity and geographic location of such capacity with expected geographic market requirements and demand 

such restructuring initiatives resulted in charges to restructuring expense of 4691 million  in 2012 and 604 million  in 2011 the most significant actions taken as part of these restructuring activities were the decisions to close our manufacturing operations in frankfurt oder germany at the end of 2012 due to the lack of policy support for utilityscale solar projects in europe and to not proceed with our 4line manufacturing plant in vietnam or a 2line manufacturing plant in france based upon expected future market demand and our focus on providing utilityscale pv generation solutions primarily to sustainable geographic markets 

the annual cost savings expected from these restructuring initiatives in 2013 and beyond are expected to be between 70 million  and 120 million  reducing both cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses in approximately equal amounts the amount of cost savings realized will in part be impacted by the actual capacity utilization in a given year these cost savings may be offset by increases in operating expenses primarily related to establishing a localized business presence in target markets pursuant to our long term strategic plan 

system level module performance warranty 

as an alternative to our module power output warranty we have offered a system level module performance warranty for a limited number of our recent system sales this system level module performance warranty is designed for utility scale systems and provides 25year plantlevel energy degradation protection the system level module performance warranty is calculated as a percentage of a system’s expected energy production adjusted for certain actual site conditions with the warranted level of performance declining each year in a linear fashion but never falling below 80 during the term of the warranty in resolving claims under the system level module performance warranty to restore the system to warranted performance levels we first must validate that the root cause is due to module performance then we typically have the option of either repairing or replacing modules providing supplemental modules or making a cash payment consistent with our module power output warranty when we elect to satisfy a valid warranty claim by providing replacement or supplemental modules under the systems level module performance warranty we do not have any obligation to pay for the labor to remove or install modules 

currently only a small percentage of our systems projects are subject to such system level module performance warranty but we expect that this percentage will increase in the future as we extend it to future systems sales arrangements we do not anticipate that the system level module performance warranty will have a material impact on our future warranty claim rates as such warranty is designed to be in line with the expected riskadjusted aggregate performance of our modules the offering of such system level warranty addresses the challenge of identifying from the potential millions of modules installed in a utility scale system individual modules that are performing below warranty by focusing on the energy generated by the system rather than the capacity of individual modules 

financial operations overview 

the following describes certain line items in our statement of operations and some of the factors that affect our operating results 

net sales 

components business 

we generally price and sell our solar modules per watt of nameplate power during 2012  the substantial majority of net sales from the components business was related to modules included in our solar systems described below under “net sales — systems business” other than the modules included in our solar power systems we sold the majority of our solar modules to solar power system project developers system integrators and operators headquartered in the united states germany france and india which either resell our solar modules to endusers or most integrate them into power plants that they own operate or sell 

  

during 2012 most of our supply contracts for the sale of solar modules with certain solar power system project developers and system integrators headquartered within the european union “eu supply contracts” were terminated upon mutual consent or expired under their terms the committed volumes we expect to sell under our remaining eu supply contracts are expected to be a minor portion of our consolidated net sales we have also entered into module sales agreements with customers worldwide for specific projects or volumes of modules such agreements are generally not long term in nature during the year ended december 31 2012  10  of our components segment’s net sales were denominated in euros and were subject to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and us dollar thirdparty module sales represented approximately 10 of our total 2012 net sales 

under our typical customer sales contracts for solar modules we transfer title and risk of loss to the customer and recognize revenue upon shipment pricing is typically fixed at the time of shipment and our customers do not typically have extended payment terms customers do not have rights of return under these contracts our revenue recognition policies for the components business is described further in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

during 2012  nrg energy inc  exelon corporation  and midamerican renewables llc  individually accounted for more than 10 of our components segment’s net sales which includes the solar modules used in our systems projects each of the above customers also represented more than 10  of our consolidated net sales 

systems business 

through our fully integrated systems business we provide a complete turnkey solar power system solution using our solar modules which may include project development epc services om services and project finance expertise 

net sales from our systems segment may include the following types of transactions 



net sales from our systems segment are impacted by numerous factors including the competitiveness of our systems offerings in comparison to our competitors’ solar systems and other forms of electricity generation the magnitude and effectiveness of support programs and other solar power system demand drivers 

during 2011 and 2012  the majority of our systems segment net sales were generated in north america net sales from our systems business during 2010 resulted primarily from solar power projects in north america and europe 

during 2012  the principal customers of our systems segment were nrg energy inc  exelon corporation  and midamerican renewables llc  each of which also accounted for more than 10 of our total net sales during 2012  

we recognize revenue for arrangements entered into by our systems business generally using two revenue recognition models following the guidance in asc 605 accounting for longterm construction contracts  or for arrangements which include land or land rights asc 360 accounting for sales of real estate our revenue recognition policies for the systems business is described further in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

for systems business sales arrangements that do not include land or land rights and thus are accounted for under asc 605 we use the percentageofcompletion method using actual costs incurred over total estimated costs to construct a project including module costs as our standard accounting policy unless we cannot make reasonably dependable estimates of the costs to complete the contract in which case we would use the completed contract method 

for systems business sales arrangements that are accounted for under asc 360 where we have gained control of land or land rights we record the sale as revenue only after all revenue recognition criteria have been met typically using either the percentageofcompletion method or once construction of a project is substantially complete revenue recognition for our systems projects is in many cases not linear in nature due to the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria have been met and consequently period over period comparisons of results of operations may not be meaningful 

systems project pipeline 

the following tables summarize as of february 26 2013  our approximately 29 gw  ac systems business advanced project pipeline as of december 31 2012  for the projects sold under contract in our project pipeline of approximately 19 gw  ac we have recognized revenue with respect to the equivalent of approximately 679 mw ac such mw ac equivalent amount refers to the ratio of revenue recognized for the projects sold under contract in our project pipeline compared to total contracted revenue for such projects multiplied by the total mw ac for such projects the remaining revenue to be recognized subsequent to december 31 2012  for the projects soldunder contract in our project pipeline is expected to be approximately 44 billion the substantial majority of such amount is expected to be recognized as revenue through the substantial completion dates of the projects sold under contract the remaining revenue to be recognized does not have a direct correlation to expected remaining module shipments for such projects sold under contract as expected module shipments do not represent total systems revenues and do not consider the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria are met including timing of module installation projects are 

removed from our project pipeline tables below once we have completed construction and after substantially all revenue has been recognized

cost of sales 

components business 

our cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials and components for manufacturing solar modules such as tempered back glass transparent conductive oxide coated front glass cadmium telluride laminate connector assemblies laminate edge seal and other items our cost of sales also includes direct labor for the manufacturing of solar modules and manufacturing overhead such as engineering equipment maintenance environmental health and safety quality and production control and procurement costs cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing plant and equipment and facilityrelated expenses in addition we accrue shipping warranty and any obligation for solar module collection and recycling costs within cost of sales 

our manufacturing cost per watt which is an operating metric we use as an indicator of manufacturing cost competitiveness represents the current manufacturing and associated costs incurred to produce and sell solar modules during a period divided by the number of salable watts produced in the same period for fiscal periods beginning in 2013 our cost per watt will exclude any costs associated with our manufacturing plants in frankfurt oder germany which closed manufacturing operations at the end of 2012 

overall we expect our cost per watt to decrease over the next several years due to an increase in watts per solar module an increase in unit output per production line and ongoing reductions in variable and fixed costs this expected decrease in cost per watt would be partially offset during periods in which we underutilize manufacturing capacity 

systems business 

within our systems business projectrelated costs include standard epc costs consisting primarily of bos costs for inverters electrical and mounting hardware project management and engineering costs and installation labor costs site specific costs and development costs including transmission upgrade costs interconnection fees and permitting costs 

as further described in note 25 “segment and geographical information”  to our consolidated financial statements included within this annual report on form 10k at the time when all revenue recognition criteria are met we include the sale of our solar modules manufactured by our components business and used by our systems business within net sales of our components business therefore the related cost of sales are also included within our components business at that time the cost of solar modules is comprised of the manufactured inventory cost incurred by our components segment 

gross profit 

gross profit is affected by numerous factors including our module and system average selling prices market demand market mix our manufacturing costs bos costs project development costs the effective utilization of our production facilities and foreign exchange rates gross profit is also affected by the mix of net sales generated by our components and systems businesses gross profit for our systems business excludes the sales and cost of sales for solar modules which we include in the gross profit of our components business 

research and development 

research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and personnelrelated costs the cost of products materials and outside services used in our process and product research and development activities for both the components and systems businesses we acquire equipment for general use in our process and product development and record the depreciation of this equipment as research and development expense currently the substantial majority of our research and development expenses are attributable to our components segment 

we maintain a number of programs and activities to improve our technology and processes in order to enhance the performance and reduce the costs of our solar modules and pv systems using our modules 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated costs professional fees insurance costs travel expenses and other selling expenses we expect selling general and administrative expense to decline over time as we reduce operating costs in connection with our restructuring activities which is a component of our long term strategic 

plan 

  

our systems business has certain of its own dedicated administrative key functions such as accounting legal finance project finance human resources procurement and marketing costs for these functions are recorded and included within selling general and administrative costs for our systems segment our corporate key functions consist primarily of companywide corporate tax corporate treasury corporate accountingfinance corporate legal investor relations corporate communications and executive management functions these corporate functions and the assets supporting such functions benefit both the components and systems segments we allocate corporate costs to the components and systems segments as part of selling general and administrative costs based upon the estimated benefits provided to each segment from these corporate functions we determine the estimated benefits provided to each segment for these corporate costs based upon a combination of the estimated time spent by corporate employees supporting each segment and the average relative selling general and administrative costs incurred by each segment before such corporate allocations 

production startup 

production startup expense consists primarily of salaries and personnelrelated costs and the cost of operating a production line before it has been qualified for full production including the cost of raw materials for solar modules run through the production line during the qualification phase it also includes all expenses related to the selection of a new site and the related legal and regulatory costs and the costs to maintain our plant replication program to the extent we cannot capitalize these expenditures in general we expect production startup expense per production line to be higher when we build an entirely new manufacturing facility compared with the addition of new production lines at an existing manufacturing facility primarily due to the additional infrastructure investment required when building an entirely new facility production startup expense is attributable to our components segment 

goodwill impairment 

during the fourth quarter of 2011 we determined that goodwill related to our components segment was impaired and recorded expense of 3934 million during 2010 and 2012 we had no goodwill impairments 

restructuring 

we have undertaken a series of restructuring initiatives as further described in note 4 “restructuring”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k in december 2011 february 2012 and april 2012 respectively we announced restructuring initiatives intended to i align the organization with our long term strategic plan including expected sustainable market opportunities ii accelerate operating cost reductions and improve overall operating efficiency and iii better align production capacity and geographic location of such capacity with expected geographic market requirements and demand 

such restructuring initiatives resulted in charges to restructuring expense of 4691 million  in 2012 and 604 million  in 2011 the most significant actions taken as part of these restructuring activities were the decisions to close our manufacturing operations in frankfurt oder germany at the end of 2012 due to the lack of policy support for utilityscale solar projects in europe and to not proceed with our 4line manufacturing plant in vietnam or a 2line manufacturing plant in france based upon expected future market demand and our focus on providing utilityscale pv generation solutions primarily to sustainable geographic markets 

the annual cost savings expected from these restructuring initiatives in 2013 and beyond are expected to be between 70 million  and 120 million  reducing both cost of sales and selling general and administrative expenses in approximately equal amounts the amount of cost savings realized will in part be impacted by the actual capacity utilization in a given year these cost savings may be offset by increases in operating expenses primarily related to establishing a localized business presence in target markets pursuant to our long term strategic plan 

foreign currency gain loss 

foreign currency gain loss consists of gains and losses resulting from holding assets and liabilities and conducting transactions denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries’ functional currencies 

interest income 

interest income is earned on our cash cash equivalents marketable securities and restricted cash and investments interest income also includes interest received from notes receivable and interest collected for late customer payments 

interest expense net 

interest expense is incurred on various debt financings we capitalize interest expense into our property plant and equipment or project assets when such costs qualify for interest capitalization reducing the amount of interest expense reported in any given reporting period 

other income expense net 

other income expense is primarily comprised of changes in fair value of foreign exchange contracts and realized gainslosses on the sale of fixed income investments 

income tax expense 

  

income taxes are imposed on our income by taxing authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate principally the united states germany and malaysia the statutory federal corporate income tax rate in the united states is 350  while the tax rates in germany and malaysia are approximately 293  and 250  respectively in malaysia we have been granted a longterm tax holiday scheduled to expire in 2027  pursuant to which substantially all of our income earned in malaysia is exempt from income tax 

critical accounting estimates 

in preparing our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” we make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts of reported assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities in our financial statements and the related notes thereto some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in the selection of the appropriate assumptions for making these estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty we base our judgments and estimates on our historical experience our forecasts and other available information as appropriate our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2012  included in this annual report on form 10k 

our critical accounting estimates which require the most significant management estimates and judgment in determining amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k are as follows 

revenue recognition  percentageofcompletion method we recognize revenue for arrangements entered into by our systems business generally using two revenue recognition models following the guidance in asc 605 accounting for longterm construction contracts or for arrangements which include land or land rights asc 360 accounting for sales of real estate for systems business sales arrangements that do not include land or land rights and thus are accounted for under asc 605 we use the percentageofcompletion method as our standard accounting policy unless we cannot make reasonably dependable estimates of the costs to complete the contract in which case we would use the completed contract method we also apply the percentageofcompletion method to certain sales arrangements covered under asc 360 only after a sale has been consummated we have transferred the usual risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer the initial and continuing investment criteria have been met we have the ability to estimate our costs and progress toward completion and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 

in applying the percentageofcompletion method we use the actual costs incurred relative to estimated costs to complete including modules in order to estimate the progress towards completion to determine the amount of revenue and profit to recognize incurred costs include all installed direct materials installed solar modules labor subcontractor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance such as indirect labor supplies and tools we recognize direct material and solar module costs as incurred costs when the direct materials and solar modules have been installed in the project when contracts specify that title to direct materials and solar modules transfers to the customer before installation has been performed we will not recognize revenue or associated costs until those materials are installed and have met all other revenue recognition requirements we consider direct materials and solar modules to be installed when they are permanently attached or fitted to the solar power systems as required by engineering designs solar modules that will be used in our solar power systems which we still hold title to remain within inventory until such modules are installed in a solar power system 

the percentageofcompletion method of revenue recognition requires us to prepare estimates of costs to complete our projects in making such estimates management judgments are required to evaluate significant assumptions such as the cost of materials and labor expected labor productivity the impact of potential variances in schedule completion the amount of net contract revenues and the impact of any penalties claims change orders or performance incentives 

if estimated total costs on any contract are greater than the contract revenues we recognize the entire estimated loss in the period the loss becomes known the cumulative effect of the revisions to estimates related to contract revenues and costs to complete contracts including penalties incentive awards claims change orders anticipated losses and others are recorded in the period in which the revisions to estimates are identified and the loss can be reasonably estimated such revisions could occur in any reporting period and the effects may be material depending on the size of the contract or the adjustment 

accrued solar module collection and recycling liability at the time of sale we recognize an expense for the estimated cost of our future obligation for collecting and recycling solar modules sold that are covered by our collection and recycling program we estimate the cost of our collection and recycling obligations based on the present value of the expected probability weighted future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules which includes estimates for the cost of packaging the solar modules for transport the cost of freight from the solar module installation sites to a recycling center the material labor capital costs and scale of recycling centers and an estimated thirdparty profit margin and return on risk for collection and recycling services we base this estimate on our experience collecting and recycling our solar modules and on our expectations about future developments in recycling technologies and processes about economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled and about the expected timing of when our solar modules will be returned for recycling in the periods between the time of our sales and the settlement of our collection and recycling obligations we accrete the carrying amount of the associated liability by applying the discount rate used for its initial measurement during the fourth quarter of 2012 we completed an annual cost study and updated our estimates for the expected future collection and recycling costs and we adjusted our module collection and recycling liability accordingly at december 31 2012  our estimated liability for collecting and recycling solar modules covered by our collection and recycling program was 2128 million  a 10 change in our estimate of the future cost of collecting and recycling a solar module would change this estimated liability by 213 million 

product warranties and manufacturing excursions  we provide a limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for 10 years following delivery to the owners of our solar modules 

we also typically warrant to the owners of our solar modules that solar modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 90  of their labeled power output rating during the first 10 years following their installation and at least 80  of their labeled power output rating during the following 15 years in resolving claims under both the defects and power output warranties we have the option of either repairing or replacing the covered solar modules or under the power output warranty providing additional solar modules to remedy the power shortfall we also have the option to make a payment for the then current market price for solar modules to resolve claims our warranties are automatically transferred from the original purchasers of our solar modules to subsequent purchasers upon resale 

as an alternative to our module power output warranty we have offered a system level module performance warranty for a limited number of our recent system sales this system level module performance warranty is designed for utility scale systems and provides 25year plantlevel energy degradation protection the system level module performance warranty typically is calculated as a percentage of a system’s expected energy production adjusted for certain actual site conditions with the warranted level of performance declining each year in a linear fashion but never falling below 80 during the term of the warranty in resolving claims under the system level module performance warranty to restore the system to warranted performance levels we first must validate that the root cause is due to module performance then we typically have the option of either repairing or replacing modules providing supplemental modules or making a cash payment consistent with our module power output warranty when we elect to satisfy a valid warranty claim by providing replacement or supplement modules under the system level module performance warranty we do not have any obligation to pay for the labor to remove or install modules 

in addition to our solar module warranty described above for solar power plants built by our systems business we typically provide a limited warranty on the balance of the system against defects in engineering design installation and workmanship for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a phase or the entire solar power plant in resolving claims under the engineering design installation and workmanship warranties we have the option of remedying the defect through repair or replacement 

when we recognize revenue for module or systems project sales we accrue a liability for the estimated future costs of meeting our limited warranty obligations we make and revise these estimates based primarily on the number of our solar modules under warranty installed at customer locations our experience with warranty claims our monitoring of field installation sites our internal testing of and the expected future performance of our solar modules and bos components and our estimated permodule replacement cost such estimates have changed and may in the future change based primarily upon historical experience including additional information received from the evaluation of warranty claims and the complete processing of such claims 

we also make an estimate for the costs of any voluntary remediation programs including our 20082009 manufacturing excursion our estimate for remediation costs for our 20082009 manufacturing excursion is based on evaluation and consideration 

of currently available information including the estimated number of affected modules in the field historical experience related to our remediation efforts customerprovided data related to potentially affected systems the estimated costs of performing any remediation services and the postsale expenses covered under our remediation program from time to time we have taken remediation actions in respect of affected modules beyond our limited warranty and we may elect to do so in the future in which case we would incur additional expenses that are beyond our limited warranty if we commit to any such remediation actions beyond our limited warranty developing our estimates for such remediation actions may require significant management judgment 

at december 31 2012  our accrued liability for product warranty was 1916 million  we have historically estimated our product warranty liability for power output and defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions to have an estimated warranty return rate of approximately 3 of modules covered under warranty a 1 percentage point change in the estimated warranty return rate would change our estimated product warranty liability by approximately 46 million 

accounting for income taxes  we are subject to the income tax laws of the united states and its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining our provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit we regularly assess the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and subsequent years’ examinations and we record tax liabilities as appropriate 

 we establish liabilities for potential additional taxes that may arise out of tax audits in accordance with asc 740 income taxes  once established we adjust the liabilities when additional information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring an adjustment significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the actual cost of a legal claim tax assessment or regulatory fine or penalty may ultimately be materially different from our recorded liabilities if any 

 in preparing our consolidated financial statements we calculate our income tax expense based on our interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business this requires us to estimate our current tax obligations and the realizability of uncertain tax positions and to assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities the net current amount of which we show as a component of current assets or current liabilities and the net noncurrent amount of which we show as other assets or other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 

we must also assess the likelihood that each of our deferred tax assets will be realized to the extent we believe that realization of any of our deferred tax assets is not more likely than not we establish a valuation allowance when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a reporting period we generally record a corresponding tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations conversely to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed which generally reduces our overall income tax expense 

we also consider the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and determine whether such amounts are indefinitely reinvested outside the united states we have concluded that except for the earnings of our canadian subsidiary and with respect to previously taxed income all such accumulated earnings are currently indefinitely reinvested accordingly no additional taxes have been accrued that might be incurred if such amounts were repatriated to the united states if our intention to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries changes additional taxes may be required to be accrued see note 21 “income taxes”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

longlived asset impairment  we are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of longlived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified we review our longlived assets each reporting period to assess whether impairment indicators are present we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event indicating potential impairment has occurred 

for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss a longlived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities we must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 

for longlived assets when impairment indicators are present we compare undiscounted future cash flows including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value to the asset group’s carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable this assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the assets to be held and used assessments also consider changes in asset group utilization including the temporary idling 

of capacity and the expected timing of placing this capacity back into production 

for an asset group that fails the test of recoverability described above the estimated fair value of longlived assets may be determined using an “income approach” “market approach” “cost approach” or a combination of one or more of these approaches as appropriate for the particular asset group being reviewed all of these approaches start with the forecast of expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of longlived assets if there is an impairment a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the asset groups fair value and carrying value prior to impairment this may require judgment in estimating future cash flows relevant discount rates and residual values applied in the income approach used in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used 

our estimates are based upon historical experience our commercial relationships and available information about future trends we believe fair value assessments are most sensitive to market changes and the corresponding impact on volume and average selling prices and that these are more subjective than manufacturing cost and other assumptions we believe our current assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate 

goodwill  goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the estimated fair value assigned to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed we do not amortize goodwill but instead are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter and if necessary we would record any impairment in accordance with asc 350 intangibles   goodwill and other  we will perform an impairment test between scheduled annual tests if facts and circumstances indicate that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill is less than its carrying value 

  

we may first make a qualitative assessment of whether it is morelikelythannot that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test the qualitative impairment test includes considering various factors including macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors a sustained share price or market capitalization decrease and any reporting unit specific events if it is determined through the qualitative assessment that a reporting unit’s fair value is morelikelythannot greater than its carrying value the twostep impairment test is not required if the qualitative assessment indicates it is morelikelythannot that a reporting unit’s fair value is not greater than its carrying value we must perform the twostep impairment test we may also elect to proceed directly to the twostep impairment test without considering such qualitative factors 

the first step in a twostep impairment test is the comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount including goodwill our two reporting units are the components and systems reporting units which are the same as our reportable segments in accordance with the authoritative guidance over fair value measurements we define the fair value of a reporting unit as the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date we primarily use the income approach methodology of valuation which includes the discounted cash flow method and the market approach methodology of valuation which considers values of comparable businesses to estimate the fair values of our reporting units we do not believe that a cost approach is relevant to measuring the fair values of our reporting units 

significant management judgment is required when estimating the fair value of our reporting units including the forecasting of future operating results the discount rates and expected future growth rates that we use in the discounted cash flow method of valuation and in the selection of comparable businesses that we use in the market approach if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value assigned to that unit goodwill is not impaired and no further analysis is required 

if the carrying value assigned to a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value in the first step then we are required to perform the second step of the impairment test in this step we assign the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in step one to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit as if a market participant just acquired the reporting unit in a business combination the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in the first step of the impairment test over the total amount assigned to the assets and liabilities in the second step of the impairment test represents the implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference if there is no such excess then all goodwill for a reporting unit is considered impaired 

reportable segment allocations  asc 280 segment reporting establishes standards for companies to report in their financial statements information about operating segments products services geographic areas and major customers the method of determining what information to report is generally based on the way that management organizes the operating segments within the company for making operating decisions and assessing financial performance 

we operate our business in two segments our components segment involves the design manufacture and sale of solar modules which convert sunlight into electricity thirdparty customers of our components segment include project developers system integrators and operators of renewable energy projects 

our second segment is our fully integrated systems business “systems segment” through which we provide complete turnkey pv solar power systems or solar solutions that draw upon our capabilities which include i project development ii engineering procurement and construction “epc” services iii operating and maintenance “om” services and iv project finance expertise we may provide our full epc services or any combination of individual products and services within our epc capabilities depending upon the customer and market opportunity all of our systems segment products and services are for pv solar power systems which use our solar modules and such products and services are sold directly to investor owned utilities independent power developers and producers commercial and industrial companies and other system owners 

in our operating segment financial disclosures we include an allocation of sales value for all solar modules manufactured by our components segment and installed in projects sold or built by our systems segment in the net sales of our components segment in the gross profit of our operating segment disclosures we include the corresponding cost of sales value for the solar modules installed in projects sold or built by our systems segment in the components segment the cost of solar modules is comprised of the manufactured cost incurred by our components segment 

after we have determined the amount of revenue earned for our systems projects following the applicable accounting guidance for the underlying sales arrangements we allocate module revenue from the systems segment to the components segment based on how our codm strategically views these segments the amount of module revenue allocated from the systems segment to the components segment is equal to an estimated average selling price for such solar modules as if the modules were sold to a third party epc customer through a long term supply agreement that establishes pricing at the beginning of each year in order to develop the estimate of the average selling price used for this revenue allocation we utilize a combination of our actual third party module sale transactions our competitor benchmarking and our internal pricing lists used to provide module price quotes to customers this allocation methodology and the estimated average selling prices are consistent with how our codm views the value proposition our components business brings to a utility scale systems project and the financial information reviewed by our codm in assessing our components business performance 

our components and systems segments have certain of their own dedicated administrative key functions such as accounting legal finance project finance human resources procurement and marketing costs for these functions are recorded and included within the respective selling general and administrative costs for our components and systems segments our corporate key functions consist primarily of companywide corporate tax corporate treasury corporate accountingfinance corporate legal investor relations corporate communications and executive management functions these corporate functions and the assets supporting such functions benefit both the components and systems segments we allocate corporate costs to the components and systems segments as part of selling general and administrative costs based upon the estimated benefits provided to each segment from these corporate functions we determine the estimated benefits provided to each segment for these corporate costs based upon a combination of the estimated time spent by corporate employees supporting each segment and the average relative selling general and administrative costs incurred by each segment before such corporate allocations infrequent and other miscellaneous costs including restructuring and manufacturing excursions are included in the components or systems segment operating results based upon which segment incurred the underlying costs

see also part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  financial operations overview  net sales  systems project pipeline” for a description of the projects in our systems project pipeline due to the distinct size and terms of the underlying sales arrangements for each project under construction timing of revenue recognition may create uneven net sales patterns making year over year comparisons less meaningful 

product revenue 

the following table sets forth the total amounts of solar modules and solar power systems net sales for the years ended december 31 2012 december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 for the purpose of the following table a “solar module revenue” is composed of total net sales from the sale of solar modules to third parties and b “solar power systems revenue” is composed of total net sales from the sale of complete solar power systems and related services including the solar modules installed in the solar power systems 



fiscal years ended december 31 2012  and december 31 2011   

  

net sales 



the 22  increase in net sales for 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to a 165  increase in net sales by our systems segment which was partially offset by a 39  decrease in net sales from our components segment 

net sales from our systems segment which excludes solar modules used in our systems projects increased by 1358 million  primarily due to increases in net sales from our av solar ranch one topaz copper mountain 2 st clair silver state north alpine imperial energy center south and avra valley projects partially offset by decreases in net sales from our agua caliente amherstburg 2 santa teresa and paloma projects the increase in net sales is due to the number and size of projects under construction between the periods as well as the timing of when all revenue recognition criteria have been met 

net sales from our components segment decreased 756 million  primarily due to a 33 decrease in module average selling prices including modules used in our systems projects and an 8 decrease in the volume of watts sold 

cost of sales 



the 40  increase in cost of sales during the year ended december 31 2012 compared with the year ended december 31 2011 was primarily due to an 867 million  increase in our systems segment primarily for bos and other construction costs related to an increase in the number and size of various utilityscale solar power systems under construction between the periods 

these increases were partially offset by a decrease in cost of sales for our components segment of 145 million including decreases of 1683 million due to a reduction in the volume of solar modules sold and continuous cost reductions in our manufacturing process and a 801 million reduction in expense for costs associated with voluntary remediation efforts related to our june 2008  june 2009 manufacturing excursion these component segment decreases were partially offset by a 443 million increase related to the underutilization of our manufacturing capacity primarily related to the idling of manufacturing lines in perrysburg malaysia and germany during portions of 2012 a 253 million increase for certain lower of cost or market inventory writedowns primarily as a result of declines in market pricing a 183 million increase related to accelerated deprecation for certain manufacturing equipment that will be replaced as part of our planned equipment upgrade programs and a 158 million increase in expense for costs associated with voluntary remediation efforts for a workmanship issue affecting a limited number of solar modules manufactured between october 2008 and june 2009 

our average manufacturing cost per watt declined by 002  per watt or 3  from 075  in 2011  to 073  in 2012  and included 001  of noncash stock based compensation the decrease is the result of increased module conversion efficiencies realized partially offset by increased underutilization during the year ended december 31 2012 

gross profit 



  

gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased by 98 percentage points in 2012 compared with 2011 this decrease was primarily attributable to a 211 percentage point decrease due to lower thirdparty module average selling prices and volumes a 13 percentage point decrease related to plant underutilization a 06 percentage point decrease resulting from lower of cost or market inventory writedowns due to declines in market pricing during the year ended december 31 2012 a 16 percentage point decrease due to lower module gross profit for modules used in our systems projects a 05 percentage point decrease due to accelerated depreciation on certain manufacturing equipment that have been replaced as part of our planned equipment upgrade programs and a 05 percentage point decrease related to costs associated with voluntary remediation efforts for a workmanship issue potentially affecting a limited number of solar modules manufacturing between october 2008 and june 2009 the decreases were partially offset by a 126 percentage point increase in systems segment gross profit due to the mix of higher gross profit projects under construction between the periods and a 32 percentage point increase related to reduced costs associated with voluntary remediation efforts for our june 2008 to june 2009 manufacturing excursion 

  

research and development 



the decrease in research and development expense of 81 million  was primarily due to a 107 million decrease in personnelrelated expenses primarily driven by decreases in sharebased compensation expense of 78 million additionally facilities expense decreased by 15 million for the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the year ended december 31 2011 for 2012 share based compensation expense decreased from 2011 primarily as a result of the impact of an increase in our actual forfeitures primarily due to restructuring activities and an increase in the estimated forfeiture rate for share based compensation awards during 2012 these decreases were partially offset by a 04 million increase in testing and qualification materials costs and a 37 million increase in other expenses which included noncapital projects and the disposal of miscellaneous property plant and equipment 

during 2012 we continued the development of our solar module technology by increasing the conversion efficiency of our modules from 119 in 2011 to 126 in 2012 

selling general and administrative 



the decrease in selling general and administrative expense of 1316 million  was primarily due to a 737 million decrease in salaries and personnelrelated expenses primarily driven by a decrease in sharebased compensation expense of 555 million for the year ended december 31 2012 sharebased compensation expense decreased from the year ended december 31 2011 primarily as a result of the impact of an increase in our actual forfeitures primarily due to restructuring activities and an increase in the estimated forfeiture rate for sharebased compensation awards there was also a 212 million decrease in project development and selling costs a 120 million decrease in professional service costs a 105 million decrease in allowance for doubtful accounts expense a 25 million decrease due to a reduction in travel expense and a 244 million decrease due to lower expense in 2012 related to the june 2008 to june 2009 manufacturing excursion these decreases were partially offset by a 93 million increase in infrastructure expenses relating to the early termination of certain leases and increased depreciation and a 33 million increase in other expenses relating to the disposal of miscellaneous property plant and equipment 

  production startup 



during 2012  we incurred 78 million  of production startup expenses primarily for our global manufacturing personnel dedicated to the installation and implementation of new equipment equipment upgrades and process improvements for existing plants as well as certain expenses related to our previously planned manufacturing capacity expansions in vietnam and arizona during 2011 we incurred 336 million  of production startup expenses primarily for manufacturing capacity expansions in malaysia and germany and our previously planned manufacturing expansions in france vietnam and arizona 

goodwill impairment 



we determined the implied fair value of goodwill in the components reporting unit was zero as of december 31 2011  as a result we impaired all of the goodwill in the components reporting unit in 2011 and recorded 3934 million  of impairment expense during 2012 there were no impairments of goodwill 

see note 6 “goodwill and intangible assets”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2012  included in this annual report on form 10k 

restructuring 



during 2012 and 2011 we incurred 4691 million  and 604 million  of restructuring expenses respectively due to charges relating to a series of restructuring initiatives as further described in note 4 “restructuring” to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2012  included in this annual report on form 10k 

foreign currency loss gain   



foreign currency loss increased during 2012  compared with 2011  primarily due to differences in foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and differences in exchange rates primarily related to the euro and malaysian ringgit 

  

interest income 



interest income decreased during 2012  compared with 2011  primarily as a result of a reduction in interest received on longterm marketable securities and restricted investments during 2012 

interest expense net 



interest expense net of amounts capitalized increased during 2012  compared with 2011  primarily due to 47 million in expense during the year ended december 31 2012 associated with the repayment of the german facility agreement the remaining increase is primarily related to an increase in average longterm debt between the periods the remaining increase was primarily due to a reduction in the amount of assets under construction and project assets that qualify for capitalized interest during the year ended december 31 2012 compared to the year ended december 31 2011 increasing interest expense net 

interest expense is incurred on various debt financings we capitalize interest expense into our property plant and equipment or project assets when such costs qualify for interest capitalization reducing the amount of interest expense reported in any given reporting period see also note 9 “consolidated balance sheet details”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2012  included in this annual report on form 10k 

other income expense net 



other income net increased during 2012  compared with 2011  primarily as a result of timing differences for amounts included in other income net 

loss income before income taxes segment profit 



components segment loss before income taxes increased by 6633 million  during 2012 compared with 2011 primarily from expenses relating to a series of restructuring initiatives lower net sales which resulted from a decrease in both average selling prices and volumes inventory writedowns and underutilization charges partially offset by decreased expense associated with our voluntary remediation efforts for our june 2008 to june 2009 manufacturing excursion 

systems segment income loss before income taxes increased 6772 million  during 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to increased systems segment revenue during 2012 compared with 2011 due to an increase in the number and size of projects under construction for which all revenue recognition criteria were met 

income tax benefit expense 



income tax expense increased by 708 million  during 2012  compared with 2011  the increase in income tax expense in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily attributable to the establishment of valuation allowances against previously established deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions operating losses generated in jurisdictions for which no tax benefit is recorded and a greater percentage of profits earned in higher tax jurisdictions see note 21 “income taxes”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2012 included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

fiscal years ended december 31 2011  and december 31 2010   

  

net sales 



the 8  increase in net sales for 2011 compared to 2010 was due to a 196  increase in net sales in our systems segment partially offset by a 15  decrease in net sales from our components segment 

net sales from our components segment which includes solar modules used in our systems projects decreased by 3431 million  primarily due to a 15 decrease in average selling prices partially offset by increases in the volume of watts sold 

net sales from our systems segment which excludes solar modules used in our systems projects increased by 5458 million  primarily due to increases in net sales from our agua caliente santa teresa amherstburg 2 and paloma projects partially offset by decreases in net sales from the sarnia 2 copper mountain 1 and cimarron projects between the periods  the increase in net sales is primarily due to the number and size of projects under construction for which all revenue recognition criteria were met between the periods 

cost of sales 



component segment cost of sales increased 2059 million  or 19   during 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to higher production and sales volumes and due to increased expense associated with voluntary remediation efforts related to the june 2008 to june 2009 manufacturing excursion 

systems segment cost of sales increased 2098 million  or 68  during 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to an increase in the number of utilityscale solar power projects under construction in north america between these periods 

  

our average manufacturing cost per watt declined by 002 per watt or 3 from 077  in 2010 to 075  in 2011 and included 001 of noncash stock based compensation 

gross profit 



  

gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased by 111 percentage points in 2011 compared with 2010 this decrease was attributable to the following a 59 percentage point reduction due to a decline in our total module asp and mix between our components and systems segments a 48 percentage point reduction relating to costs associated with our june 2008 to june 2009 manufacturing excursion a 18 percentage point reduction due to an increase in expected warranty claims for potential module performance in certain climates and a 06 percentage point reduction due to inventory writedowns these decreases were partially offset by a 19 percentage point increase attributable to continued manufacturing scale and reductions in our manufacturing cost per watt and a 01 percentage point increase due to the weakening of the euro against the us dollar exchange rate 

research and development 



the increase in research and development expense was primarily due to a 193 million increase in personnelrelated expenses including a 45 million increase in sharebased compensation expense resulting from hiring for increased investment in various research and development projects a 256 million increase in testing and qualification material cost and a 23 million increase in facilities and utilities expenses these increases were partially offset by a decrease in other expenses of 15 million 

during 2011 we continued the development of our solar module technology by increasing the conversion efficiency of our modules from 113 in 2010 to 119 in 2011 

selling general and administrative 



the increase in selling general and administrative expense in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to a 348 million increase in estimated compensation payments to customers under certain circumstances for power lost prior to the remediation of the customer’s system under our manufacturing excursion remediation program discussed above a 152 million increase in infrastructure spending partially related to the implementation of a new erp system a 145 million increase in salaries and personnelrelated expenses including a 15 million increase in sharebased compensation expense a 105 million increase in allowance for doubtful accounts expense an 86 million increase in expenses related to the development of systems projects and new markets and a 73 million increase in expenses related to professional fees facilities and other operating expenses 

production startup 



during 2011 we incurred 336 million of production startup expenses primarily due to manufacturing expansion or previously planned manufacturing expansion activity in germany malaysia vietnam france and arizona including legal regulatory and personnel costs compared with 194 million of production startup expenses for manufacturing expansion activity in malaysia france ohio and germany during 2010 production startup expenses are comprised of the cost of labor material and depreciation expense to run and qualify the production lines related facility expenses management of our replication process and legal and regulatory costs 

goodwill impairment 



we determined the implied fair value of goodwill in the components reporting unit to be 0 as of december 31 2011 as a result we impaired all of the goodwill in the components reporting unit and recorded 3934 million of impairment expense in 2011 

see note 6 “goodwill and intangible assets”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2012 

included in this annual report on form 10k 

restructuring 



during 2011 we incurred 604 million of restructuring expenses due to charges relating to a series of initiatives to accelerate operating cost reductions and improve overall operating efficiency see note 4 “restructuring”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2012 included in this annual report on form 10k 

foreign currency gain loss 



foreign currency gain increased during 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to a decrease in our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities in 2011 

interest income 



interest income decreased during 2011 compared with 2010 primarily as a result of interest received from notes receivable and penalties for late customer payments during 2010 partially offset by interest received on longterm investments during 2011 

interest expense net 



interest expense net of amounts capitalized remained consistent during 2011 compared with 2010 as a result of substantially all interest expense being capitalized into property plant and equipment or project assets during both periods 

other income expense net 



other income net decreased during 2011 compared with 2010 primarily as a result of a realized gain associated with the sale of our equity investment in a related party in 2010 

loss income before income taxes segment profit 



components segment loss income before taxes decreased 9407 million  during 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to goodwill impairment restructuring initiatives lower average selling prices and higher costs resulting from the manufacturing excursion and related remediation program discussed above partially offset by an increase in volume of solar modules sold 

systems segment loss before income taxes decreased 1249 million  during 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to an increase in the number and size of systems projects under construction for which all revenue recognition criteria were met between the periods for discussion of profitability of various systems projects see gross profit discussion above 

income tax benefit expense 



income tax benefit expense decreased by 1121 million  during 2011 compared with 2010 the reduction in income tax expense in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily attributable to the reduction in pretax profits during such period and a greater percentage of profits earned in lower tax jurisdictions offset by an increase in tax expense related to the impairment of nondeductible goodwill see note 21 “income taxes”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2012 included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2012  although we had a net loss for the year we believe that our cash cash equivalents marketable securities cash flows from operating activities including the contracted portion of our project pipeline availability under our revolving credit facility considering minimum liquidity covenant requirements and access to the capital markets will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months we intend to continue to carefully execute our long term strategic plan and manage credit and market risk however if our financial results or operating plans change from our current assumptions we may not have sufficient resources to support the execution of our long term strategic plan 

cash generated from operations is our primary source of operating liquidity and we believe that internally generated cash flows combined with our existing cash and cash equivalents marketable securities and availability under our revolving credit facility considering minimum liquidity covenant requirements are sufficient to support daytoday business operations our treasury department monitors our working capital to ensure we have adequate liquidity both domestically and internationally to support the execution of our long term strategic plan 

we intend to maintain appropriate debt levels based upon cash flow expectations the overall cost of capital cash requirements for operations capital expenditures and discretionary strategic spending in the future we may also engage in one or more debt or equity financings we believe that when necessary we will have adequate access to the capital markets although our ability to raise capital on terms commercially acceptable to us could be constrained if there is insufficient investor interest due to industrywide or companyspecific concerns such financings could result in increased expenses or dilution to our existing stockholders if we are unable to obtain debt or equity financing on reasonable terms we may be unable to execute our long term strategic plan 

as of december 31 2012  we had 10039 million  in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities compared with 7880 million  as of december 31 2011  as of december 31 2012  and december 31 2011  5485 million  and 6389 million  respectively of our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in euros and us dollardenominated holdings we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed 

our expanding systems business required increased liquidity in 2012 and is expected to continue to have significant liquidity requirements in the future solar power project development cycles which span the time between the identification of a site location to the commercial operation of a pv power plant vary substantially and can take many years to mature as a result of these long project cycles we may need to make significant upfront investments of resources in advance of the receipt of any cash from the sale of such systems projects these amounts include payment of interconnection and other deposits some of which are nonrefundable posting of letters of credit and incurring engineering permitting legal and other expenses additionally we may have to use our working capital or the availability under our revolving credit facility to finance the construction of our systems projects if such projects cannot be sold before construction begins depending upon the size and number of projects that we are developing and selffinancing the construction of the systems business may require significant liquidity for example we may have to substantially complete the construction of a systems project before such project is sold delays in construction or in completing the sale of our systems projects which we are selffinancing may also impact our liquidity we have historically financed these upfront investments for project development and when necessary construction primarily using working capital 

the following significant developments in 2012 have impacted or are expected to impact our liquidity 

  

 

 

 

 61 

believe that the soldcontracted portion of our advance stage systems project pipeline will provide us with sufficient liquidity and working capital to prudently execute our long term strategic plan 

 

 

 

 

 

the unprecedented disruption in the credit markets that began in 2008 and the current instability in europe have had a significant adverse impact on a number of financial institutions the ongoing sovereign debt problems in europe and its impact on the balance sheets and lending practices of european banks in particular could negatively impact our access to and cost of capital and therefore could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and competitive position it could also similarly affect our customers and therefore limit the demand for our systems projects or solar modules as of december 31 2012 our liquidity and marketable securities and restricted investments have not been materially adversely impacted by the current credit environment and we believe that they will not be materially adversely impacted in the near future we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity and the credit markets however we cannot predict with any certainty the impact to us of any further disruption in the current credit environment 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes the key cash flow metrics for the years ended december 31 2012  december 31 2011  and december 31 2010  in thousands 



operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 7622 million  during 2012  compared with cash used in operating activities of 335 million  during 2011  and cash provided by operating activities of 7055 million  during 2010 the increase in operating cash flows during 2012  was primarily due to higher net cash received from customers in 2012 as compared to 2011 and 2010 this increase was partially offset by an increase in net cash paid to suppliers during 2012 as compared to 2011 and 2010 in addition income taxes paid net of refunds decreased from payments of 801 million  and 462 million  in 2010 and 2011 respectively to a net refund of 215 million  in 2012 primarily due to certain german income tax refunds received during 2012 the remaining increase in cash provided by operating activities was the result of net differences in excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation arrangements interest received and interest paid in 2012 compared to 2011 and 2010 

  investing activities 

cash used in investing activities was 3837 million  during 2012  compared with 6765 million  during 2011  and 7421 million  during 2010 cash used in investing activities during 2012 included capital expenditures of 3792 million  compared to 7318 million  and 5889 million  in 2011 and 2010 respectively the decrease in capital expenditures was primarily due to a lower amount of capital expenditures during 2012 related to our previously planned manufacturing plants in vietnam and mesa arizona compared to capital expenditures made during 2011 and 2010 related to manufacturing plant expansions primarily in malaysia and germany also we decreased our net investment in marketable securities by 795 million  during 2012 compared to decreases of 1614 million  during 2011 and 948 million  during 2010 cash used to fund our estimated future collection and recycling program costs for covered solar modules during 2012 was 807 million  compared to 627 million  in 2011 and 431 million  in 2010 in january 2011 we acquired ray tracker inc a tracking technology and photovoltaic balance of systems company in an allcash transaction with an initial payment of 211 million  during the year ended 2012 we made a second payment of 24 million  under the terms of the acquisition agreement in july 2010 we acquired nextlight renewable power llc a leading developer of utilityscale solar projects in the southwestern united states for 2965 million  the remaining change in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by a reduction in restricted cash during 2012 compared to 2011 

financing activities 

cash used in financing activities was 891 million  during 2012 compared with cash provided by financing activities of 5712 million  during 2011 and 1505 million  during 2010 

cash used in financing activities during 2012 resulted primarily from the repayment of longterm debt which included our german facility agreement for a total of 1788 million  and the repayment of economic development funding of 68 million  partially offset by the net proceeds from our revolving credit facility of 700 million  and excess tax benefit from sharebased compensation arrangements of 274 million  

cash provided by financing activities was 5712 million  during 2011 and resulted primarily from proceeds of 3701 million  from borrowings on our malaysian ringgit facility agreement german facility agreement and malaysian euro facility along with 1000 million  of net proceeds from borrowings under our revolving credit facility additionally we recorded excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation arrangements of 1108 million  and received cash from employee stock option exercises of 83 million  we used 338 million  of cash for the repayment of longterm debt 

  

cash provided by financing activities was 1505 million  during 2010 and resulted primarily from proceeds received from borrowings under our revolving credit facility of 1000 million  excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation arrangements of 694 million and from cash received from employee stock option exercises of 94 million partially offset by the repayment of longterm debt of 279 million 

  

contractual obligations 

the following table presents our contractual obligations as of december 31 2012  in thousands which consists of legal commitments requiring us to make fixed or determinable cash payments we purchase raw materials for inventory or balance of systems parts services and manufacturing equipment from a variety of vendors we also enter into contracts for the construction of systems business solar power projects during the normal course of business in order to manage manufacturing and construction lead times and help assure adequate supply we enter into agreements with suppliers that either allow us to procure goods and services when we choose or that establish purchase requirements each year or over the term of the agreement 



 

 

 

in addition to the amounts shown in the table above we have recorded 1415 million  of unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with asc 740 income taxes  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 

debt and credit sources 

as of december 31 2012  we had 5633 million  in outstanding longterm debt excluding amounts related to capital leases and unamortized discount and 1716 million  in outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees our longterm debt consisted of the following at december 31 2012  and december 31 2011  in thousands 



at december 31 2012  future principal payments on our longterm debt excluding amounts related to capital leases and 

unamortized discounts were due as follows in thousands 



the available capacity under our revolving credit facility  was 1991 million   at december 31 2012  we believe that when necessary we will have adequate access to capital markets but there may be circumstances in the future related to macroeconomic conditions or factors specific to us that could limit or increase the cost of capital from such markets 

 we were in compliance with all debt covenants at december 31 2012  and expect to remain in compliance with these covenants for at least the next twelve months 

see note 16 “debt”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further information about our longterm debt facilities 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2012

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our primary foreign currency exposures are cash flow exposure transaction exposure and earnings translation exposure 

cash flow exposure  we expect our subsidiaries to have material future cash flows including net sales and expenses that will be denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries’ functional currencies our primary cash flow exposures are cash received from customers cash paid to suppliers and associates changes in the exchange rates between our subsidiaries’ functional currencies and the other currencies in which they transact will cause fluctuations in the cash flows we expect to receive or pay when these cash flows are realized or settled accordingly we enter into foreign exchange forward and crosscurrency swap contracts to hedge the value of a portion of these forecasted cash flows these foreign exchange forward and crosscurrency swap contracts qualified as cash flow hedges in accordance with asc 815 derivatives and hedging  and we designated them as such we initially report the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss in “accumulated other comprehensive income loss” and subsequently reclassify amounts into earnings when the underlying hedged transaction is settled 

our operations in malaysia pay a portion of their operating expenses such as associate wages and utilities in malaysian ringgit exposing us to foreign currency exchange risk for those malaysian ringgit expenses as a result of our restructuring of our european operations including the closure of our frankfurt oder plant at the end of 2012 our exposure to foreign exchange risk associated with the euro is significantly reduced compared to 2011 and 2010 

for additional details on our derivative hedging instruments and activities refer to note 10 “derivative financial instruments”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

our international operations accounted for 20  55  and 87  of our net sales during the years ended december 31 2012  december 31 2011  and december 31 2010  respectively of which 18  78  and 84  of these international sales respectively were denominated in euros as a result we have exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to our net sales fluctuations in exchange rates particularly in the us dollar to euro and us dollar to malaysian ringgit affect our gross profit and could result in foreign exchange and operating losses in the past most of our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk has related to 

currency gains and losses between the time we sign and settle our sales contracts denominated in euros for the years ended december 31 2012  december 31 2011  and december 31 2010  a 10 change in the euro exchange rates would have impacted our net euro sales by 116 million  1237 million  and 1846 million  respectively excluding the effect of our hedging activities our net sales denominated in euros are expected to continue to decline and therefore our foreign currency exchange risk associated with the euro is expected to also decline 

transaction exposure many components of our business have assets and liabilities primarily receivables investments accounts payable debt and accrued liabilities and solar module collection and recycling liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the subsidiary’s functional currency changes in the exchange rates between our subsidiaries’ functional currencies and the other currencies in which these assets and liabilities are denominated can create fluctuations in our reported consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other derivative instruments to economically hedge assets and liabilities against the shortterm effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations the gains and losses on these derivative instruments will offset all or part of the transaction gains and losses that we recognize in earnings on the related foreign currency assets and liabilities these contracts typically have maturities of less than three months  

for additional details on our economic hedging instruments and activities refer to note 10 “derivative financial instruments”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

if the us dollar would have weakened by 10 against the euro malaysian ringgit and canadian dollar the impact on our loss before income taxes during the year ended december 31 2012  would have been 24 million  unfavorable if the us dollar would have weakened by 10 against the euro malaysian ringgit and canadian dollar the impact on our income loss before income taxes during the years ended december 31 2011  and december 31 2010  would have been 05 million  favorable and 66 million  unfavorable respectively 

earnings translation exposure  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to translate the financial statements of our subsidiaries that do not have a us dollar functional currency we may decide to purchase forward exchange contracts or other instruments to offset this impact from currency fluctuations these contracts would be markedtomarket on a monthly basis and any unrealized gain or loss would be recorded in earnings we do not hedge translation exposure at this time but may do so in the future 

in the past currency exchange rate fluctuations have had an impact on our business and results of operations for example currency exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted our cash flows by 63 million  214 million  and 127 million  in the years ended december 31 2012  december 31 2011  and december 31 2010  respectively although we cannot predict the impact of future currency exchange rate fluctuations on our business or results of operations we believe that we will continue to have risk associated with currency exchange rate fluctuations in the future we will continue to evaluate actions we can take to use derivative instruments to help mitigate this risk 

interest rate risk 

our primary interest rate risks are our outstanding variable rate debt our solar power system sales prices from the effect of interest rates on our customer’s financing of such solar power systems and our investments in marketable securities and restricted investments 

variable rate debt exposure we are exposed to interest rate risk because our revolving credit facility malaysian ringgit facility agreement malaysian euro facility agreement and the floating rate portion of our malaysian facility agreement have variable interest rates exposing us to variability in interest expense and cash flows we use interest rate and crosscurrency swap contracts to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated with a portion of our variable rate debt instruments we have interest rate swap contracts in place to mitigate the interest rate risk for a portion of the floating rate portion of our malaysian facility agreement we also have a crosscurrency swap contract in place to mitigate the interest rate risk of our malaysian ringgit facility agreement 

for additional details on our derivative hedging instruments and activities refer to note 10 “derivative financial instruments”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 an increase in the euro interbank offered rate “euribor” would impact our cost of borrowing under our malaysian euro facility agreement  and an increase in the london interbank offered rate “libor” would impact our cost of borrowing under our revolving credit facility  if euribor changes by 100 basis points our interest cost for the year ended december 31 2012  would have changed by 06 million  if libor changed by 100 basis points our interest cost for the year ended december 

31 2012 would have changed by 17 million  

effect of interest rates on our customer’s financing of solar power systems  we are exposed to interest rate risk because many of our systems business customers depend on debt and equity financing to purchase a solar power system from us although the useful life of a solar power system is considered to be approximately 25 years owners of our solar power systems must pay the entire cost of the solar power system by the time such system is completed as a result many of our customers rely on debt financing to fund their upfront capital expenditures an increase in interest rates available to finance such purchases could make it difficult for our customers to secure the financing and underlying interest rate necessary to purchase a system this could lower demand or the price we can charge for our solar power systems and reduce our net sales and gross profit in addition we believe that a significant percentage of our customers purchase solar power systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt an increase in interest rates could lower an investor’s return on investment in a system or make alternative investments more attractive relative to solar power systems which in each case could cause these endusers to seek alternative investments that promise higher returns 

investments in marketable securities and related investment exposure  we invest in various debt securities which exposes us to interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and provide liquidity while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the market value of the investment to fluctuate for example if we hold a security that was issued with an interest rate fixed at the thenprevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises the market value of our investment may decline 

as of december 31 2012  our marketable securities earned a pretax yield of 050  with a weighted average maturity of 8 months  if interest rates were to instantaneously change by 100 basis points the market value of our total investment portfolio would change by 07 million  the direct risk to us associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our marketable security portfolio and we do not believe that a 10 change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows as of december 31 2012  all of our marketable securities were in commercial paper corporate debt securities federal and foreign agency debt foreign government obligations supranational debt and us government obligations  

as of december 31 2012  our restricted investments earned a pretax yield of 385  with a weighted average maturity of approximately 18  years if interest rates were to instantaneously change by 100 basis points the market value of our total restricted investment portfolio would change by 554 million  the direct risk to us associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our restricted investment portfolio given that our restricted investment portfolio prefunds our estimated solar module collection and recycling obligations and given the expected holding period of these investments we believe it is unlikely that a 10 change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows as of december 31 2012  all of our restricted investments were in foreign and us government obligations 

commodity and component risk 

we are exposed to price risks for the raw materials components and energy costs used in the manufacture and transportation of our solar modules and bos parts used in solar power systems also some of our raw materials and components are sourced from a limited number of suppliers or a single supplier we endeavor to qualify multiple suppliers using a robust qualification process in some cases we also enter into longterm supply contracts for raw materials and components as a result we remain exposed to price changes in the raw materials and components used in our solar modules in addition a failure by a key supplier could disrupt our supply chain which could result in higher prices andor a disruption in our manufacturing or construction processes we may be unable to pass along changes in the cost of the raw materials and components for our products and systems to our customers and may be in default of our delivery obligations if we experience a manufacturing disruption 

credit risk 

we have certain financial and derivative instruments that subject us to credit risk these consist primarily of cash cash equivalents marketable securities restricted investments trade accounts receivable interest rate swap contracts crosscurrency swap contracts and foreign exchange forward contracts we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial and derivative instruments we place cash cash equivalents marketable securities restricted investments interest rate swap contracts crosscurrency contracts and foreign exchange forward contracts with various highquality financial institutions and limit the amount of credit risk from any one counterparty we continuously evaluate the credit standing of our counterparty financial institutions 

in addition we have certain investments in debt securities related to countries in the eurozone these investments are for 

debt securities of countries with a lower likelihood of experiencing significant economic fiscal andor political strains resulting in a default or severe decreases in fair value however such risk cannot be entirely eliminated and is reflected in the current fair value of the investments as of december 31 2012 




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and   financial disclosure 

none 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

a evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain “disclosure controls and procedures” as such term is defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met additionally in designing disclosure controls and procedures our management was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures the design of any disclosure control and procedure also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 

based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level 

b management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate “internal control over financial reporting” as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2012  based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission “coso” our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 

based on the results of our evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2012  

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2012  has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in its report which appears herein 

c changes in internal control over financial reporting 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer conducted an evaluation of our “internal control over financial reporting” as defined in exchange act rule 13a15f and rule 15d15f to determine whether any changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the year ended december 31 2012  that materially affected or are reasonably likely to material affect our internal control over financial reporting 

based on that evaluation there have been no such changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended december 31 2012  that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

d inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud control systems no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the control systems’ objectives are being met further the design of any control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of all controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within our company have been detected these inherent 

limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of error or mistake control systems can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures

 item 1 business 

overview 

we manufacture and sell solar modules with an advanced thinfilm semiconductor technology and we design construct and sell photovoltaic pv solar power systems 

in addressing overall growing global demand for pv solar electricity we have developed a differentiated fully integrated systems business that can provide a lowcost turnkey utilityscale pv system solution for system owners and low cost electricity to utility endusers our fully integrated systems business has enabled us to increase module throughput drive cost reduction across the value chain identify and break constraints to sustainable markets and deliver compelling solutions to our customers and endusers with our fully integrated systems business we believe we are in a position to expand our business in transition markets and eventually economically sustainable markets in which support programs are minimal which are expected to develop in areas with abundant solar resources and sizable electricity demand we are committed to continually lowering the cost of solar electricity and in the long term we plan to compete on an economic basis with conventional fossilfuelbased peaking power generation 

in furtherance of our goal of delivering the lowest cost of solar electricity and achieving price parity with conventional fossilfuelbased peak electricity generation we are continually focused on reducing pv solar system costs in four primary areas module manufacturing balance of systems bos costs consisting of the costs of the components of a solar power system other than the solar modules such as inverters mounting hardware grid interconnection equipment wiring and other devices and installation labor costs project development costs and the cost of capital first with respect to our module manufacturing costs our advanced technology has allowed us to reduce our average module manufacturing costs to the lowest in the world for modules produced on a commercial scale based on publicly available information in 2011  our total average manufacturing costs were 075  per watt which we believe is less than those of traditional crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers by continuing to improve conversion efficiency production line throughput and lower material costs we believe that we can further reduce our manufacturing costs per watt and maintain our cost advantage over traditional crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers second with respect to our bos costs by continuing to improve conversion efficiency leverage volume procurement around standardized hardware platforms and accelerate installation times we believe we can continue to make reductions in bos costs which represent over half of all of the costs associated with a typical utilityscale pv solar power system third with respect to our project development costs we seek optimal site locations in an effort to minimize transmission and permitting costs and to accelerate lead times to electricity generation finally with respect to our cost of capital by continuing to demonstrate the financial viability and operational performance of our utilityscale pv solar power plants and increase our pv solar power system operating experience we believe we can continue to lower the cost of capital associated with our pv solar power systems thereby further enhancing the economic viability of our projects and lowering the cost of electricity generated by pv solar power systems that incorporate our modules 

and technology 

we are the world’s largest thinfilm pv solar module manufacturer and one of the worlds largest pv solar module manufacturers we produced nearly 2  gigawatts gw of solar modules in 2011  we manufacture our solar modules on highthroughput production lines and perform all manufacturing steps ourselves in an automated proprietary and continuous process our solar modules employ a thin layer of semiconductor material to convert sunlight into electricity our manufacturing process eliminates the multiple supply chain operators and expensive and time consuming batch processing steps that are used to produce crystalline silicon solar modules currently we manufacture our solar modules at our perrysburg ohio frankfurtoder germany and kulim malaysia manufacturing facilities and we conduct our research and development activities primarily at our perrysburg ohio manufacturing facility 

  

our fully integrated pv solar power systems business includes i project development ii engineering procurement and construction epc services iii operating and maintenance om services including monitoring and diagnostics md services and iv project finance expertise all as described in more detail below 

 

 

 

 

we believe that combining our reliable lowcost module manufacturing capability with our systems business enables us to more rapidly reduce the price of solar electricity accelerate the adoption of our technology in utilityscale pv solar power systems identify and remove constraints on the successful migration to sustainable solar markets around the world and further our mission to create enduring value by enabling a world powered by clean affordable solar electricity 

long term strategic plan 

in december 2011 we announced a long term strategic plan long term strategic plan or ltsp with a goal to transition to primarily sustainable opportunities by the end of 2014 in executing the ltsp we will focus on providing solar pv generation solutions to sustainable geographic markets that we believe have a compelling need for massscale pv electricity including new 

markets throughout the americas asia the middle east and africa as part of our ltsp we expect to focus on opportunities in which our solar pv generation solutions will compete directly with fossil fuel offerings on a levelized cost of energy basis and decrease our focus on rooftop solar execution of the ltsp will entail a reallocation of resources around the globe in particular dedicating resources to regions such as latin america asia the middle east and africa where we have not traditionally conducted significant business to date we will evaluate and manage closely the appropriate level of resources required as we transition into and penetrate these specific markets we intend to dedicate significant capital and human resources to reduce the total installed cost of solar pv generation to optimize the design and logistics around our solar pv generation solutions and to ensure that our solutions integrate well into the overall electricity ecosystem of the specific region 

segment information 

  

  we operate our business in two segments our components segment involves the design manufacture and sale of solar modules which convert sunlight into electricity thirdparty customers of our components segment include project developers system integrators and operators of renewable energy projects 

our second segment is our systems business which involves the sale of our solar modules coupled with the engineering procurement and construction of the solar pv power plant as part of our systems offerings we also offer om services when applicable we sell our systems offerings primarily through two channels 1 direct to thirdparty customers such as investor owned utilities independent power developers and producers commercial and industrial companies and other system owners and 2 our inhouse project development pipeline through our inhouse project development pipeline we combine the systems offerings with the sale of the project to third parties which in certain situations include the facilitation of project finance historically the sale of projects to third parties have included but are not limited to independent power producers and financial sponsors 

our chief operating decision maker codm consisting of certain members of our senior executive staff has viewed the manufacturing and sale of solar modules from the components segment as the core driver of our resource allocation profitability and cash throughput all sales or service offerings from our systems segment are for pv solar power systems that use our solar modules which are designed and manufactured by our components segment as a result we have viewed our systems segment as an enabler to drive module throughput our systems segment enables solar module throughput by developing state of the art construction techniques and process management to reduce the installed cost of our pv systems and accordingly this business was not intended to generate profits that are independent of the underlying solar modules sold with such systems segment service offerings therefore for the fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 our codm viewed the primary objective of our systems segment to acheive breakeven results before income taxes in our operating segment financial disclosures we include all sales of solar modules manufactured by our components segment and installed in projects sold by our systems segment in “net sales” of our components business see note 24 “segment and geographical information”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

components business 

our components segment involves the design manufacture and sale of solar modules which convert sunlight into electricity 

solar modules 

each solar module is a glass laminate approximately 2ft x 4ft 60cm x 120cm in size that encapsulates a cadmium telluride cdte thinfilm semiconductor our solar modules had an average rated power of approximately 80 watts  76 watts  and 75 watts  for 2011  2010  and 2009  respectively our semiconductor structure is a singlejunction polycrystalline thinfilm that uses cadmium telluride as the absorption layer and cadmium sulfide as the window layer cadmium telluride has absorption properties that are highly matched to the solar spectrum and can deliver competitive conversion efficiencies using only about 12 of the amount of semiconductor material ie silicon that is used to manufacture traditional crystalline silicon solar modules 

manufacturing process 

we have integrated our manufacturing processes into a continuous production line with the following three stages the deposition stage the cell definition stage and the assembly and test stage in the deposition stage panels of treated glass are robotically loaded onto the production line where they are cleaned heated and coated with a layer of cadmium sulfide followed by a layer of cadmium telluride using our proprietary vapor transport deposition technology after which the semiconductorcoated plates are cooled rapidly to increase strength in the cell definition stage we use high speed lasers to transform the large single semiconductor coating on the glass plate into a series of interconnected cells that deliver the desired current and voltage output our proprietary laser scribing technology is capable of accomplishing accurate and complex scribes at high speeds finally in the 

assembly and test stage we apply busbars interlaminate material and a rear glass cover sheet that is laminated to encapsulate the semiconductor a junction box and termination wires are then applied to complete the assembly each solar module is then tested for current leakage and measured on a solar simulator the final assembly stage is the only stage in our production line that requires manual processing 

our manufacturing facilities in perrysburg ohio frankfurtoder germany and kulim malaysia have each received an iso 9001 quality system certification an iso 140012004 environmental management systems certification and the occupational health and safety standards assessment series ohsas 18001 certification an international occupational health and safety management system specification we anticipate that any future manufacturing facilities will also obtain these certifications within 24 months of production startup and qualification 

research development and engineering 

we continue to devote a substantial amount of resources to research and development with the primary objective of lowering the cost of electricity generated by pv systems using our solar modules within our components business we focus our research and development activities on among other areas continuing to increase the conversion efficiency of our solar modules and improving manufacturing efficiencies including throughput improvement volume ramp and material cost reduction we believe the most promising ways of increasing the conversion efficiency of our solar modules include maximizing the number of photons that reach the absorption layer of the semiconductor material to facilitate conversion into electrons maximizing the number of electrons that reach the surface of the semiconductor and minimizing the electrical losses between the semiconductor layer and the back metal conductor 

in the course of our research and development activities we continuously explore and research technologies in our efforts to sustain competitive differentiation in our modules we typically qualify process and product improvements for full production at our ohio plant and then use our process to propagate them to our other production lines we believe that our systematic approach to research and development will provide continuous improvements and ensure uniform adoption across our production lines in addition our production lines are replicas of each other and as a result a process or production improvement on one line can be rapidly deployed to other production lines 

in the past year we have set two new world records for cdte pv solar module efficiency achieving cdte solar cell efficiency of 173 percent and total area module efficiency of 144 percent cell efficiency measures the proportion of light converted to energy in a single solar cell whereas total area module efficiency measures light conversion across a productionsize multicell solar module providing a more realistic assessment of realworld performance than cell efficiency both the cell and module recordsetters were constructed using commercialscale manufacturing equipment and materials at our perrysburg ohio factory and both records were confirmed by the us department of energys national renewable energy lab 

customers 

  

with respect to our components business during 2011  we sold the majority of our solar modules to solar power system project developers system integrators and operators headquartered in germany france india italy and the united states which either resell our solar modules to endusers or integrate them into power plants that they own operate or sell our customers typically develop construct own and operate solar power plants or sell turnkey solar power plants to endusers that include owners of land owners of agricultural buildings owners of commercial warehouses offices and industrial buildings public agencies municipal government authorities utility companies and financial investors who desire to own largescale solar power plant projects as described above under “ business – long term strategic plan ”  we are investing in sustainable market development particularly in areas with abundant solar resources and sizable electricity demand including the americas asia and the middle east and africa mena 

as of december 31 2011  we had supply contracts for the sale of solar modules entered into in prior years and expiring at the end of 2012 with thirteen  solar power system project developers and system integrators headquartered within the european union supply contracts these supply contracts historically accounted for a significant portion of our planned module production but the committed volumes in 2012  are not expected to have as significant of an effect on our overall financial performance in 2012 compared to prior years in the past we have amended pricing volume delivery timing and other terms in our supply contracts on a prospective basis in order to remain competitive and we may decide in the future to further amend these contracts in order to address the highly competitive environment for solar modules effective september 30 2011 the rebate program under which we provided certain of our customers a price rebate for solar modules purchased from us ended we have begun early stage discussions with our customers under current supply contracts regarding replacement contracts for periods covering 2013 and beyond but such replacement contracts are not expected to be longterm in nature as we execute on our long term strategic plan we expect these supply contracts to account for a declining portion of our planned module production we 

also enter into module sales agreements with customers worldwide for specific projects or volumes of modules in watts for additional information regarding the rebate program see note 8 “consolidated balance sheet details”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

  

during 2011  the principal thirdparty customers of our components business were edf en development  and belectric  during 2011  each of these two customers individually accounted for more than 10  of our components segment’s net sales each of our other customers individually accounted for less than 10  of our components segment’s net sales during 2011  the loss of any of our major components business customers could have an adverse effect on our business as described above under “business – long term strategic plan” we are seeking to develop additional customer relationships primarily in sustainable markets and regions which would reduce our customer and geographic concentration and dependence 

while our supply contracts have certain firm purchase commitments these contracts are subject to amendments made by us or requested by our customers such as the above mentioned amendments we have historically made these amendments decreased the expected revenue under our supply contracts during 2009 2010 and 2011 in addition our supply contracts are substantially denominated in euro and therefore are subject to exchange rate fluctuations between the euro and us dollar 

competition 

the renewable energy solar energy and solar module sectors are highly competitive and continually evolving as these sector participants strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete within the larger electric power industry we face intense competition which may result in significant price reductions reduced margins or loss of market share with respect to our components business our primary sources of competition are currently crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers as well as other thinfilm module manufacturers and companies developing solar thermal and concentrated pv technologies certain of our existing or future competitors may be part of larger corporations that have greater financial resources and greater brand name recognition than we do and as a result may be better positioned to adapt to changes in the industry or the economy as a whole certain competitors may have direct or indirect access to sovereign capital which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time among pv module and cell manufacturers the principal methods of competition include price per watt production capacity conversion efficiency reliability warranty terms and payment terms in 2011 industry average module pricing declined significantly as competitors reduced prices to sellthrough inventories in europe and elsewhere if competitors reduce module pricing to levels near or below their manufacturing costs or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time our results of operations could be adversely affected at december 31 2011  the global pv industry consisted of more than  150 m anufacturers of solar modules and cells in the aggregate these manufacturers have installed production capacity that significantly exceeded global demand in 2011 we believe this structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity significantly exceeds current global demand will continue for the foreseeable future and we expect that it will continue to put pressure on pricing which could adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition we expect to compete with future entrants to the pv industry that offer new technological solutions we may also face competition from semiconductor manufacturers and semiconductor equipment manufacturers or their customers several of which have already announced their intention to start production of pv cells solar modules or turnkey production lines 

we also face competition from companies that currently offer or are developing other renewable energy technologies including wind hydropower geothermal biomass and tidal technologies and other power generation sources that burn conventional fossil fuels 

raw materials 

our manufacturing process uses approximately 30 types of raw materials and components to construct a complete solar module one critical raw material in our production process is cadmium telluride of the other raw materials and components the following eight are also critical to our manufacturing process front glass coated with transparent conductive oxide cadmium sulfide photo resist laminate material tempered back glass cord platecord plate cap lead wire and solar connectors before we use these materials and components in our manufacturing process a supplier must undergo a rigorous qualification process we continually evaluate new suppliers and currently are qualifying several new suppliers and materials when possible we attempt to use suppliers that can provide a raw material supply source that is local to our manufacturing locations reducing the cost and lead times for such m aterials a few of our critical materials or components are single sourced and most others are supplied by a limited number of suppliers we have previously explored tellurium mineral claims in various locations with the intention of developing them but after further analysis we have determined to cease such tellurium exploration and development activities 

collection and recycling program 

consistent with the environmental philosophy of extended producer responsibility we have established the solar industrys first comprehensive prefunded module collection and recycling program the program is designed to maximize the recovery of valuable materials for use in new modules or other new products and minimize the environmental impacts associated with our modules at the end of their useful life approximately 90 of each collected first solar module is recycled into materials for use in new products including new solar modules endusers can request collection and recycling of their solar modules by us at any time at no cost we fund the estimated collection and recycling cost for the prior year’s module sales within 90 days of the end of the fiscal year assuming for this purpose a minimum service life of 25 years  for our solar modules in addition to achieving substantial environmental benefits our solar module collection and recycling program may provide us the opportunity to resell or redistribute working modules or recover certain raw materials and components for reuse in our manufacturing process we currently have recycling facilities operating at each manufacturing facility for manufacturing scrap warranty returns and modules collected at the end of their useful life that produce glass suitable for use in the production of new glass products and unrefined semiconductor materials that will be further processed by a third party supplier and then used to produce semiconductor materials for use in our solar modules 

to ensure that the prefunded amounts are available regardless of our financial status in the future a trust structure has been established funds are put into custodial accounts in the name of a trustee only the trustee can distribute funds from the custodial accounts and these funds cannot be accessed for any purpose other than for administering module collection and recycling either by us or a third party executing the collection and recycling services to provide further assurance that sufficient funds will be available our module collection and recycling program including the financing arrangement is periodically reviewed by an independent auditor 

  solar module warranty 

we have historically provided a limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for 5 years following delivery to the owners of our solar modules for solar module sales made subsequent to september 30 2011 we have increased the limited warranty we provide against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions from 5 years to 10 years 

we also warrant to our owners that solar modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 90 of their power output rating during the first 10 years following their installation and at least 80 of their power output rating during the following 15 years in resolving claims under both the defects and power output warranties we have the option of either repairing or replacing the covered solar modules or under the power output warranty providing additional solar modules to remedy the power shortfall for modules sold after september 30 2011 we also have the option to make a payment for the thencurrent market module price to resolve claims our warranties are automatically transferred from the original purchasers of our solar modules to subsequent purchasers upon resale as of december 31 2011  our components business’ accrued warranty liability was 1555 million  of which 770 million  was classified as current and 785 million  was classified as noncurrent as of december 31 2010  our components business’ accrued warranty liability was 265 million of which 98 million was classified as current and 167 million was classified as noncurrent 

  

systems business 

through our fully integrated systems business we provide a complete solar power system solution using our solar modules which may include project development epc services om services when applicable and project finance when required 

our systems business has grown over the past several years through a combination of business acquisitions and organic growth in april 2009 we completed the acquisition of the project development business of optisolar inc which included a multigigawatt project pipeline in july 2010 we completed the acquisition of nextlight renewable power llc nextlight a leading developer of utilityscale solar projects in the southwestern united states the nextlight transaction expanded our pipeline of solar power projects in the southwestern united states and further expands our position in the us utilityscale power market 

our systems business is dependent upon successful completion of project development activities including site selection and securing rights to acquire or use the site obtaining in a timely manner the requisite interconnection and transmission studies executing an interconnection agreement obtaining environmental and land use permits maintaining effective site control and entering into a power purchase agreement with an offtaker of the power to be generated by the project these activities culminate in receiving the right to construct and operate a solar power system depending on the market opportunity or geographic location we may acquire projects in various stages of development or acquire project companies from developers in order to complete the development process construct a pv power plant incorporating our modules and sell the system to investors ppas or fit structures define the price and terms the utility customer or investor will pay for power produced from a project entering into a ppa generally 

provides the underlying economics needed to finalize development including permitting begin construction arrange the financing and market the project for sale to a longterm project owner depending primarily on the location stage of development upon our acquisition of the project and other site attributes the development cycle typically ranges from one to five years we may be required to incur significant costs for preliminary engineering permitting legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built if there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals we may be forced to incur additional costs or writedown capitalized investments and the right of the offtaker under the ppa to terminate may be triggered 

our systems business current and planned activities are focused on markets around the world 

in north america we have as of february 28 2012  a 27  gw ac pipeline of projects that we expect to construct we are also developing other projects in north america that do not yet have ppas see item 7 “ management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – financial operations overview – net sales – systems business” for a listing of these projects 

in europe we are engaged in project development activities with respect to certain projects in germany and italy and we are actively evaluating additional project opportunities in matured european markets and emerging eastern europe 

in asia including india china and southeast asia and the middle east and north africa mena we have been actively pursuing opportunities to offer our utilityscale pv systems solutions we expect our focus on and investment in these markets to increase as we execute our long term strategic plan 

customers 

with respect to our systems business our customers consist of investor owned utilities independent power developers and producers commercial and industrial companies and other system owners who purchase from us completed solar power plants epc services and om services when required during 2011  the substantial majority of our systems business sales were generated in north america 

during 2011  the principal customer of our systems business was nrg energy  during 2011  this customer individually accounted for the majority of our systems segment’s net sales each of our other customers individually accounted for less than 10 of our system segments net sales during 2011  

competition 

with respect to our systems business we face competition from other providers of renewable energy solutions including developers of pv solar thermal and concentrated solar power systems and developers of other forms of renewable energy projects including wind hydropower geothermal biomass and tidal projects to the extent other solar module manufacturers become more vertically integrated we expect to face increased competition from such companies as well we also face competition from other epc companies and joint ventures between epc companies and solar companies 

epc warranty 

in addition to our solar module warranty described above for solar power plants built by our systems business we typically provide a limited warranty against defects in workmanship engineering design and installation services under normal use and service conditions for a period of one to two years following the energizing of a section of a solar power plant or upon substantial completion of the entire solar power plant in resolving claims under the workmanship design and installation warranties we have the option of either remedying the defect to the warranted level through repair refurbishment or replacement as of december 31 2011  our systems business’ accrued warranty liability was 22 million  of which 16 million  was classified as current and 06 million  was classified as noncurrent as of december 31 2010  our systems business’ accrued warranty liability was 14 million all of which was classified as current 

support programs 

support programs for pv solar electricity generation depending on the jurisdiction include feedin tariffs fits quotas including renewable portfolio standards and tendering systems and net metering programs in addition to these financial incentives for renewables include tax incentives grants loans rebates and production incentives although we expect to become less impacted by and less dependent on support programs as we execute on our long term strategic plan and transition into sustainable markets support programs will continue to play varying roles in accelerating adoption of our pv solar systems around 

the world 

under a basic fit program producers of renewable energy are paid a set rate for their electricity usually differentiated according to the technology used and size of the installation for pv solar the rate has historically been set above market rates and is fixed for a period of up to 25 years in most countries with fits grid operators are obliged to provide priority and guaranteed access to the grid for renewable energy installations the additional costs of these schemes are generally passed through to the electricity consumers by way of a premium on the kilowatt hour kwh enduser price these fit subsidies have been critical for the development of the solar industry because they provided the demand visibility required for module manufacturers and other participants in the solar value chain to reduce costs and drive scale prior to 2011 the majority of our module sales had been for gridconnected ground or commercial roof mounted solar power systems in germany and other european union countries with fit subsidies 

whereas fit laws set the price and let the market determine capacity and generation quota systems work in reverse in general governments mandate a minimum share of capacity or gridconnected generation of electricity to come from renewable energy sources this share often increases over time with a specific final target and enddate the mandate can be placed on producers distributors or consumers 

there are two main types of quota systems used obligationcertificate and tendering systems a renewable portfolio standard rps is in the former category under an rps regulated utilities are required to procure a specified percentage of their total electricity sales to enduser customers from eligible renewable resources such as solar generating facilities by a specified date some programs further require that a specified portion of the total percentage of renewable energy must come from solar generating facilities the majority of states in the us have enacted legislation adopting rps mechanisms rps legislation and implementing regulations vary significantly from state to state particularly with respect to the percentage of renewable energy required to achieve the state’s rps mandate the definition of eligible renewable energy resources and the extent to which renewable energy credits paper certificates representing the generation of renewable energy qualify for rps compliance currently there is no federal rps mandate or clean energy standard although the obama administration has called upon the united states congress to create one measured in terms of the volume of renewable electricity required to meet its rps mandate california’s rps program is the most significant in the us and the california market for renewable energy dominates the western us region first enacted in 2002 california’s rps statute has been amended several times to increase the overall percentage requirement as well as to accelerate the target date for program compliance pursuant to amendments enacted by the california legislature in april 2011 the california rps program now requires obligated load serving entities to procure 33 of their retail electricity demand from eligible renewable resources by 2020 

in contrast to an rps system tendering systems of procurement such as those used in south africa and india are focused on specific targets for new capacity in south africa for example the government is procuring bids under a competitive tender with solicitation dates spread over about two years the request for proposal rfp is the first major solicitation in support of a target of over 8 gw of renewable energy in south africa’s integrated resource plan project proponents bid competitively at each solicitation date until all the capacity has been allocated the tender solicitation approach allows governments or utilities to proscribe project construction time frames to achieve specific generation targets for the electricity system 

net energy metering programs enable endusers to install renewable systems and to offset their retail energy consumption with production from onsite facilities and in some cases to sell excess solar electricity to their retail electricity provider because the bundled cost of retail electricity usually exceeds the cost of unbundled electricity net metering programs provide an incentive to the enduser based on the savings for the electricity system the policies governing net energy metering vary by state and utility some utilities pay the enduser in advance while others credit the enduser’s bill 

tax incentive programs exist in the united states at both the federal and state level and can take the form of investment and production tax credits accelerated depreciation and sales and property tax exemptions at the federal level investment tax credits for business and residential solar systems have gone through several cycles of enactment and expiration since the 1980’s in october 2008 the united states congress extended the 30 federal investment tax credit itc for both residential and commercial solar installations for eight years through december 31 2016 the itc is a primary economic driver of solar installations in the united states its extension through 2016 has contributed to greater medium term demand visibility in the us however its expiration at the end of 2016 unless extended underscores the need for the levelized cost of electricity from solar systems to continue to decline toward grid parity two federal programs related to renewable energy ended in 2011 i the department of energy section 1705 loan guarantee program for renewable energy projects renewable energy manufacturing facilities and electric power transmission projects and ii the department of the treasury section 1603 cash grant program which provided cash grants equal to 30 of the cost of the system for solar installations that were placed into service during 2009 2010 and 2011 and for certain solar installations for which construction began prior to december 31 2011 this cash grant was available in lieu of receiving the 30 federal investment tax credit the intent of this program was to ensure that investors who had historically 

supported the renewable energy programs would not be constrained from investing in these transactions by tax losses they may have suffered during the recent credit crisis 

in europe renewable energy targets in conjunction with fits have contributed to the growth in pv solar markets renewable energy targets prescribe how much energy consumption must come from renewable sources while fit policies are intended to support new supply development by providing investor certainty a 2001 european union eu directive for promoting renewable energy use in electricity generation directive 200177ec set varying national indicative targets for renewable energy production from individual member states a 2009 eu directive on renewable energy directive 200928ec which replaced the 2001 directive sets varying targets for all eu member states in support of the directives goal of a 20 share of energy from renewable sources in the eu by 2020 and requires national action plans that establish clear pathways for the development of renewable energy sources the following is a description of fit policies adopted in certain critical markets in support of renewable energy targets 

germany which accounted for approximately 23  of our 2011  net sales will account for a declining percentage of our net sales over the next three years due to changing levels of policy support and demand the german government continues to evaluate changes to the german renewable energy law or the eeg and recently proposed significant and accelerated fit reductions for projects up to 10 mw and an elimination of fits for projects over 10 mw these proposed fit changes if adopted would particularly impact the competitiveness in germany of our core offering of largescale free field pv systems and modules to be installed in such systems if these policy changes proposed by the german environment and economy ministers are approved without change by the german parliament they will negatively affect longterm demand and price levels for our pv products in germany which could adversely impact our results of operations 

in france which accounted for approximately 15  of our 2011  net sales the government adopted a decree introducing a new market support framework in the first quarter of 2011 the new framework foresees a tender process for large rooftop and freefield systems and is expected to have a negative effect on the total volumes of pv deployed in france in 2012 as previously announced we have postponed the construction of our previously announced 2line plant in france until global supply and demand dynamics support the additional manufacturing capacity 

in ontario canada a fit program was introduced in september 2009 and replaced the renewable energy standard offer program resop as the primary subsidy program for renewable energy projects in order to participate in the ontario fit program certain provisions relating to minimum required domestic content and agricultural land use restrictions for solar installations must be satisfied the domestic content and land restriction rules do not apply to our solar projects governed by resop contracts however pv solar power systems incorporating our modules do not presently satisfy the domestic content requirement under the fit program currently in effect trade challenges have been initiated at the world trade organization wto to contest the ontario fit’s domestic content requirements it is possible that such requirements could be removed from the program in response to a wto decision 

in australia which accounted for less than 1 of our 2011  net sales the solar industry is driven by several regulatory initiatives that support the installation of solar pv modules in both rooftop and freefield applications including the federal government’s nationwide renewable energy target which has set a renewable energy goal for australia of 20 by 2020 australia’s recently legislated clean energy future package results in a carbon pricing mechanism commencing on july 1 2012 with a fixed carbon price that will transition to a flexibleprice capandtrade scheme on july 1 2015 this will support the creation of the aud 10 billion clean energy finance corporation cefc a commercially orientated fund established to drive the deployment of nonwind renewable energy in addition the australian government has legislated the establishment of a new independent statutory body the australian renewable energy agency arena to manage over aud 32 billion in renewable energy investments 

in india which accounted for nearly 8  of our 2011 net sales the national solar mission includes a goal of installing 22 gw of solar power generation capability by 2022 india also announced a fit policy for the first phase of the national solar mission in 2010 in addition some states including gujarat rajasthan and karnataka have developed or are developing statelevel solar procurement programs 150 mws of ppas were signed under the national solar mission phase 1 batch 1 and 933 mws of ppas were signed under gujarat state’s program an estimated 400 mws of these ppas were installed in 2011 

in china governmental authorities recently adopted a national fit policy for large scale projects china also expanded the golden sun program an upfront cost subsidy program aimed primarily at distributed generation in addition according to the current draft of the 12th 5year plan for solar energy the government intends to raise the 2015 goal for total cumulative solar energy capacity to 15 gw and 50 gw by 2020 in 2011 we executed two small demonstration projects with key chinese generating companies to test module performance in china in 2009 we entered into a memorandum of understanding with the ordos china city government relating to the construction of a utility scale pv power plant located within the ordos new energy industry demonstration zone in china and are in the process of completing a feasibility study for the first 30 mw phase 

  

in the middle east and north africa mena several countries have announced sizeable solar targets although policy mechanisms are not yet firmly established in the kingdom of saudi arabia a solar policy with targets and incentives is expected in 2012 the size of the program is expected to be tens of gigawatts of solar by 2030 or as early as 2020 in the united arab emirates abu dhabi has set a target of sourcing 7 of electricity supply from renewables by 2020 and in 2011 issued a tender for the first of three 100 mw pv projects in january 2012 dubai announced plans for a 1 gw solar farm by 2030 in morocco the government has set a 2 gw solar goal by 2020 other markets such as algeria egypt jordan kuwait oman qatar and tunisia are also actively promoting solar and issuing tenders 

while the potential of the abovereferenced mena markets are significant policy promulgation and market development are especially vulnerable to governmental inertia political instability geopolitical risk fossil fuel subsidization andor potentially stringent localization requirements 

for more information about risks related to economic incentives please see item 1a “risk factors — reduced growth in or the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives and other support for ongrid solar electricity applications including potential midyear fit reductions or other program changes in germany and certain other core markets could reduce demand andor price levels for our solar modules and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales and adversely impact our operating results” 

intellectual property 

our success depends in part on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technology and to conduct our business without infringing on the proprietary rights of others we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks and trade secrets as well as associate and third party confidentiality agreements to safeguard our intellectual property we regularly file patent applications to protect inventions arising from our research and development and are currently pursuing patent applications in the us and worldwide our patent applications and any future patent applications might not result in a patent being issued with the scope of the claims we seek or at all and any patents we may receive may be challenged invalidated or declared unenforceable in addition we have registered andor have applied to register trademarks and service marks in the us and a number of foreign countries for “first solar” and “first solar and design” 

with respect to proprietary knowhow that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce we rely on among other things trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests we believe that many elements of our pv manufacturing process including our unique materials sourcing involve proprietary knowhow technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications including technical processes equipment designs algorithms and procedures we have taken security measures to protect these elements all of our research and development personnel have entered into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us these agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our associates to assign to us all of the inventions designs and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us we also require our customers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our modules technology or business plans 

we have not been subject to any material intellectual property claims 

environmental health and safety matters 

our operations include the use handling storage transportation generation and disposal of hazardous materials and hazardous wastes we are subject to various national state local and international laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the use management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes occupational health and safety and the cleanup of contaminated sites therefore we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions and costs arising from third party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations or noncompliance with environmental permits required for our operations we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety requirements and do not expect to incur material expenditures for environmental and occupational health and safety controls in the foreseeable future however future developments such as more aggressive enforcement policies the implementation of new more stringent laws and regulations or the discovery of unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition see item 1a “ risk factors  environmental obligations and liabilities could have a substantial negative impact on our financial condition cash flows and profitability”

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the following information together with the other information in this annual report on form 10k before buying shares of our stock if any of the following risks or uncertainties occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our stock could decline 

  

risks related to our markets and customers 

an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may continue to cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

solar manufacturers have installed production capacity that significantly exceeded global demand in 2011 we believe this structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity significantly exceeds current global demand will continue for the foreseeable future and we expect that it will continue to put pressure on pricing in light of the increase in global production capacity we recently decided not to proceed any further with the development of our previously announced 4line plant in vietnam and have also postponed the commissioning of our previously announced 4line plant in mesa arizona and the construction of our previously announced 2line plant in france until such time as global supply and demand dynamics support the additional manufacturing capacity there can be no assurance that we will not be required to take further actions to address global production supply and demand in those geographic areas additionally in 2011 industry average sales prices per watt asps declined significantly as competitors reduced asps to sellthrough inventories in europe and elsewhere if our competitors reduce module pricing to levels near or below their manufacturing costs or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time or if demand for pv modules does not grow sufficiently to justify the current production supply our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

if pv technology is not suitable for widespread adoption at economically attractive rates of return or if sufficient additional demand for solar modules does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate our net sales and profit may flatten or decline and we may be unable to sustain profitability 

the solar energy market is at a relatively early stage of development in comparison to fossil fuelbased electricity generation if pv technology proves unsuitable for widespread adoption at economically attractive rates of return or if additional demand for solar modules fails to develop sufficiently or takes longer to develop than we anticipate we may be unable to grow our business or generate sufficient net sales to sustain profitability in addition demand for solar modules in our targeted markets including north america europe india china the middle east australia and other foreign jurisdictions may develop to a lesser extent than we anticipate many factors may affect the viability of widespread adoption of pv technology and demand for solar systems and modules including the following

thermal concentrated pv and biomass 

 

 

 

reduced growth in or the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives and other support for ongrid solar electricity applications including recently announced midyear feedintariff reductions or other program changes in germany and certain other core markets could reduce demand andor price levels for our solar modules and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales and adversely impact our operating results 

although our long term strategic plan provides for first solar to transition over time toward operating in sustainable markets in the nearterm our net sales and profits remain subject to variability based on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives federal state and local governmental bodies in many countries have provided subsidies in the form of fit rebates tax incentives and other incentives to endusers distributors systems integrators and manufacturers of pv products many of these jurisdictions including the majority of us states and numerous european union countries have adopted renewable portfolio standards in which the government requires jurisdictions or regulated utilities to supply a portion of their total electricity from specified sources of renewable energy such as solar wind and hydroelectric power many of these government incentives expire phase out over time require renewal by the applicable authority or may be amended a summary of recent developments in the major government subsidy programs that can impact our business appears under item 1 “business – support programs” to the extent these government incentives are reduced earlier than previously expected or freefield or conversion land applications are disadvantaged such changes could reduce demand andor price levels for our solar modules lead to a reduction in our net sales and adversely impact our operating results 

germany which accounted for approximately 23  of our 2011  net sales will account for a declining percentage of our net sales over the next three years due to changing levels of policy support and demand the german government continues to evaluate changes to the german renewable energy law or the eeg and recently proposed significant and accelerated fit reductions for projects up to 10 mw and an elimination of fits for projects over 10 mw these proposed fit changes if adopted would particularly impact the competitiveness in germany of our core offering of largescale free field pv systems and modules to be installed in such systems if these policy changes proposed by the german environment and economy ministers are approved without change by the german parliament they will negatively affect longterm demand and price levels for our pv products in germany which could adversely impact our results of operations 

in france the government introduced a new market support framework during the first quarter of 2011 the level of this new market support framework is inadequate for us to pursue an expansion strategy in france as a result we have postponed the construction of our previously announced 2line plant in france until global supply and demand dynamics support the additional manufacturing capacity 

the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 arra and the 2010 tax act provide for certain measures intended to benefit ongrid solar electricity generation and other renewable energy initiatives the expiration of the department of treasury’s section 1603 cash grant program on december 31 2011 may adversely affect our ability to arrange financing for utilityscale projects by forcing reliance on less abundant tax equity financing and may otherwise adversely affect the attractiveness of the us solar market the expiration of the department of energy section 1705 loan guarantee program for renewable energy projects renewable energy manufacturing facilities and electric power transmission projects may adversely affect our ability to arrange financing in the future for utilityscale projects by increasing our cost of capital and may also otherwise affect the attractiveness of the us solar market 

in ontario canada a fit program was introduced in september 2009 and replaced the renewable energy standard offer program resop as the primary subsidy program for renewable energy projects in order to participate in the ontario fit program certain provisions relating to minimum required domestic content and agricultural land use restrictions for solar installations must be satisfied the domestic content and land restriction rules do not apply to our solar projects governed by resop contracts however pv solar power systems incorporating our modules do not presently satisfy the domestic content requirement under the fit program currently in effect and thus projects incorporating our modules would not qualify for the ontario fit in the event the ontario domestic content requirement rules are not eliminated we will not be able to participate in the ontario fit program 

and thus our ability to pursue an expansion strategy in ontario canada beyond our remaining resop projects would be adversely affected 

in australia the solar industry is driven by several regulatory initiatives that support the installation of solar pv modules in both rooftop and freefield applications including the federal government’s nationwide renewable energy target which has set a renewable energy goal for australia of 20 by 2020 the creation of the clean energy finance corporation cefc and the establishment of the australian renewable energy agency arena also occurred in 2011 and will begin implementation in 2012 if such programs or other initiatives are not successfully executed in addressing australia’s renewable energy goals the size and attractiveness of australia’s solar market may be limited and we may be unable to sell modules or systems in australia at an attractive price limiting one of our anticipated growth markets 

in india the national solar mission includes a goal of installing 22 gw of solar by 2022 there is no guarantee that india will maintain this goal or adopt the required policies to meet that goal without which the size and attractiveness of india’s solar market may be limited and we may be unable to sell modules or systems in india at an attractive price limiting one of our anticipated growth markets 

in china governmental authorities recently adopted a national fit but the specific terms and future of the program are unclear it is currently assumed that the term is 25 years and the fit will be in place in 2012 but not clear if there will be a digression beyond that the fit is economically viable given local generation company low return requirements but project costs are depressed given high competition in component manufacturing ie over 400 local module manufacturers are selling into the market participation in the golden sun program for distributed generation also includes an implicit requirement for local manufacturing 

in the middle east and north africa mena several countries have announced sizeable solar targets although policy mechanisms are not yet firmly established policy promulgation and market development are especially vulnerable to governmental inertia political instability geopolitical risk fossil fuel subsidization and potentially stringent localization requirements this vulnerability may adversely affect our ability to expand in or enter into such markets or may otherwise affect the attractiveness of such solar markets 

reduced growth in or the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar energy applications could limit our growth or cause our net sales to decline and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could be adversely affected by any violations of the us foreign corrupt practices act “fcpa” and foreign antibribery laws  

the fcpa generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to nonus government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business other countries in which we operate also have antibribery laws some of which prohibit improper payments to government and nongovernment persons and entities our policies mandate compliance with these antibribery laws we currently operate in and pursuant to our long term strategic plan intend to further expand into many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances strict compliance with antibribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices in addition due to the level of regulation in our industry our entry into new jurisdictions including india china and the middle east requires substantial government contact where norms can differ from us standards although we implement policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these antibribery laws our employees subcontractors and agents may take actions in violation of our policies and antibribery laws any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could subject us to criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition cash flows and reputation 

  

we may be unable to fully execute on our long term strategic plan which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we face numerous difficulties in executing our long term strategic plan particularly in new foreign jurisdictions including each of the risks described in the risk factors entitled “our substantial international operations subject us to a number of risks including unfavorable political regulatory labor and tax conditions in foreign countries” and “reduced growth in or the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives and other support for ongrid solar electricity applications including recently announced midyear feedintariff reductions or other program changes in germany and certain other core markets could reduce demand andor price levels for our solar modules and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales and adversely impact our operating results” as well as the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

an increase in interest rates or lending rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets including a reduction in total tax equity availability could make it difficult for endusers to finance the cost of a pv system and could reduce the demand for our solar systems or modules andor lead to a reduction in the average selling price for pv modules 

many of our customers and our systems business depend on debt andor equity financing to fund the initial capital expenditure required to develop build and purchase a pv system as a result an increase in interest rates or lending rates or a reduction in the supply of project debt financing or tax equity investments could reduce the number of solar projects that receive financing or otherwise make it difficult for our customers or our systems business to secure the financing necessary to develop build purchase or install a pv system on favorable terms or at all and thus lower demand for our solar modules which could limit our growth or reduce our net sales in addition we believe that a significant percentage of our endusers install pv systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt an increase in interest rates andor lending rates could lower an investor’s return on investment in a pv system increase equity return requirements or make alternative investments more attractive relative to pv systems and in each case could cause these endusers to seek alternative investments as described above under item 1 “business — support programs” the 30 grant in lieu of the federal investment tax credit under the arra expired december 31 2011 and unless extended will not be available for solar installations that begin construction on or after january 1 2012 if such program is not extended total tax equity availability could be reduced which may adversely affect our ability to arrange financing for utilityscale projects and may adversely affect the attractiveness of the us solar market 

we currently depend on a limited number of customers within our components business the loss of or a significant reduction in orders from any of these customers could significantly reduce our net sales and negatively impact our operating results 

within our components business we continue to sell a sizeable portion of our solar modules to customers headquartered throughout the european union although this portion is expected to continue to decline as we execute our long term strategic plan during 2011  our two largest customers for our components business each accounted for more than 10 of our components business’ net sales our customer base within our components business is still concentrated to a significant extent in germany and therefore additional german fit reductions could reduce demand andor price levels for our modules sold to these customers the loss of any of our large customers their inability to perform under their contracts or their default in payment could significantly reduce our net sales and adversely impact our operating results our customers may face significant challenges under current economic conditions including lack of capital to finance solar projects and rising costs associated with leasing or otherwise acquiring land and rooftops for solar projects although we believe that we can mitigate this risk in part by reallocating modules 

to other customers if the need arises we may be unable in whole or in part to mitigate the reduced demand for our modules further in the event that we determine that our planned production of solar modules exceeds the demand we anticipate we may decide to reduce or halt production of solar modules in our manufacturing facilities however we may incur costs in doing so and we may be unable to anticipate and respond to the oversupply of solar modules because we have limited visibility into our customers’ inventories 

  

risks related to regulations 

existing regulations and policies and changes to these regulations and policies may present technical regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of pv products which may significantly reduce demand for our solar modules 

the market for electricity generation products is heavily influenced by foreign federal state and local government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry as well as policies promulgated by electric utilities these regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customerowned electricity generation in the united states and in a number of other countries these regulations and policies have been modified in the past and may be modified again in the future these regulations and policies could deter enduser purchases of pv products and investment in the research and development of pv technology for example without a mandated regulatory exception for pv systems utility customers are often charged interconnection or standby fees for putting distributed power generation on the electric utility grid if these interconnection standby fees were applicable to pv systems it is likely that they would increase the cost of using pv systems to our endusers which could make them less desirable thereby adversely affecting our business prospects results of operations and financial condition in addition with respect to utilities that utilize a peak hour pricing policy or timeofuse pricing methods whereby the price of electricity is adjusted based on electricity supply and demand electricity generated by pv systems currently benefits from competing primarily with expensive peak hour electricity rather than the less expensive average price of electricity modifications to the peak hour pricing policies of utilities such as to a flat rate for all times of the day would require pv systems to achieve lower prices in order to compete with the price of electricity from other sources 

we anticipate that our solar systems and modules will be subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with national and local ordinances relating to building codes safety environmental protection utility interconnection and metering and other matters it is difficult to track the requirements of individual jurisdictions and design equipment to comply with the varying standards any new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to our solar modules may result in significant additional expenses to us or our customers and as a result could cause a significant reduction in demand for our solar systems and modules 

environmental obligations and liabilities could have a substantial negative impact on our financial condition cash flows and profitability 

our operations involve the use handling generation processing storage transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations at the national state local and international levels these environmental laws and regulations include those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the use management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites and occupational health and safety we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs and capital expenditures in complying with these laws and regulations in addition violations of or liabilities under environmental laws or permits may result in restrictions being imposed on our operating activities or in our being subjected to substantial fines penalties criminal proceedings third party property damage or personal injury claims cleanup costs or other costs such solutions could also result in substantial delay or termination of projects under construction within our systems business which could adversely impact our results of operations while we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements future developments such as more aggressive enforcement policies the implementation of new more stringent laws and regulations or the discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition our solar modules contain cadmium telluride and cadmium sulfide elemental cadmium and certain of its compounds are regulated as hazardous material due to the adverse health effects that may arise from human exposure although the risks of exposure to cadmium telluride are not believed to be as serious as those relating to exposure to elemental cadmium the toxicological properties of cadmium telluride have not been thoroughly investigated and reported in our manufacturing operations we maintain engineering controls to minimize our associates’ exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds and require our associates who handle cadmium compounds to follow certain safety procedures including the use of personal protective equipment such as respirators chemical goggles and protective clothing in addition we believe the risk of exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds from our endproducts is limited by the encapsulated nature of these materials in our products and the physical properties of cadmium compounds used in our products and further minimized by the voluntary implementation in 2005 of our collection and recycling program for our solar modules while we believe that these factors and procedures are sufficient 

to protect our associates endusers and the general public from adverse health effects that may arise from cadmium exposure we cannot ensure that human or environmental exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds used in our products will not occur any such exposure could result in future third party claims against us as well as damage to our reputation and heightened regulatory scrutiny of our products which could limit or impair our ability to sell and distribute our products the occurrence of future events such as these could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

the use of cadmium in various products is also subject to governmental regulation in several countries more restrictive regulation in this area andor expansion of such regulation to additional countries could impact the manufacture sale collection and recycling of solar modules and could require us to make unforeseen environmental expenditures or limit our ability to sell and distribute our products 

  

risks related to our operations manufacturing and technology 

our operating history to date may not serve as an adequate basis to judge our future prospects and results of operations 

our historical operating results may not provide a meaningful basis for evaluating our business financial performance and prospects we may be unable to achieve similar growth or grow at all in future periods our ability to achieve similar growth in future periods is also affected by current economic conditions our past results occurred in an environment where among other things capital was at times more accessible to our customers to finance the cost of developing solar projects and economic incentives for solar power in certain core markets such as the german fit were more favorable accordingly you should not rely on our results of operations for any prior period as an indication of our future performance 

we face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules as well as thinfilm solar modules and solar thermal and concentrated pv systems if global supply exceeds global demand it could lead to a reduction in the average selling price for pv modules  which could reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations 

the solar energy and renewable energy industries are highly competitive and continually evolving as participants strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete with the larger electric power industry within the global pv industry we face competition from crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers other thinfilm solar module manufacturers and companies developing solar thermal and concentrated pv technologies existing or future solar manufacturers might be acquired by larger companies with significant capital resources thereby intensifying competition with us in addition the introduction of a low cost disruptive technology could adversely affect our ability to compete which could reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations 

even if demand for solar modules continues to grow the rapid manufacturing capacity expansion undertaken by many solar module manufacturers particularly manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules has created and may continue to cause periods of structural imbalance during which supply exceeds demand see “an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may continue to cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations” in addition we believe a significant decrease in the cost of silicon feedstock would provide significant reductions in the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules and lead to further pricing pressure for solar modules and potentially the oversupply of solar modules 

  

during any such period our competitors could decide to reduce their sales prices in response to competition even below their manufacturing costs in order to generate sales other competitors may have direct or indirect access to sovereign capital which could enable such competitors to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time as a result we may be unable to sell our solar modules at attractive prices or for a profit during any period of excess supply of solar modules which would reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations also we may decide to lower our average selling price to certain customers in certain markets in response to competition 

thinfilm technology has a short history and our thinfilm technology and solar modules and systems may perform below expectations problems with product quality or performance may cause us to incur significant andor unexpected warranty and related expenses damage our market reputation and prevent us from maintaining or increasing our market share 

researchers began developing thinfilm semiconductor technology over 25 years ago but were unable to integrate the technology into a solar module production line until about a decade ago our thinfilm technology and solar modules may not have a sufficient operating history to confirm how our solar modules will perform over their estimated 25year useful life we perform a variety of quality and life tests under different conditions however if our thinfilm technology and solar modules perform below expectations we could lose customers and face substantial warranty expense 

we have historically provided a limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for 5 years following delivery to the owners of our solar modules for solar module sales made subsequent to september 30 2011 we have increased the limited warranty we provide against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions from 5 years to 10 years 

we also warrant to our owners that solar modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 90 of their power output rating during the first 10 years following their installation and at least 80 of their power output rating during the following 15 years as a result we bear the risk of extensive warranty claims long after we have sold our solar modules and recognized net sales as of december 31 2011  our accrued warranty liability was 1577 million  of which 786 million  was classified as current and 791 million  was classified as noncurrent 

  

during the period from june 2008 to june 2009 a manufacturing excursion occurred whereby certain modules manufactured during that time period may experience premature power loss once installed in the field the root cause of the manufacturing excursion was identified and addressed in june 2009 beginning in 2009 we initiated a voluntary remediation program beyond our standard warranty pursuant to which we made commitments to customers with systems containing modules affected by the manufacturing excursion that we would cover certain costs of remediation efforts we have expensed 2157 million total todate for the estimated costs of remediating systems affected by modules manufactured during the relevant period including 1456 million for remediation expenses beyond our limited warranty obligations and 701 million in product warranty expense reflecting the net increase in the expected number of replacement modules required in connection with our remediation efforts this estimate is based on our evaluation and consideration of the currently available information including the estimated number of affected modules in the field historical experience related to our remediation efforts customerprovided data related to potentially affected systems and the estimated costs of performing the logistical services covered under our remediation program in addition to those customers with systems affected by modules manufactured during the relevant period that we have already identified we are working with a number of additional customers who may have affected modules to complete our analysis of their claims based upon our experience to date with our remediation approach together with the data currently available we estimate that if we ultimately remediate these systems under our current remediation program we could incur additional costs related to our voluntary remediation program of up to approximately 44 million  this includes approximately 24 million  beyond our limited warranty obligations in connection with these claims including the costs of actual remediation and the costs of additional compensation payments to customers under certain circumstances and approximately 20 million  related to additional product warranty liability 

if any of our estimates related to the above referenced manufacturing excursion prove incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses which could adversely impact our financial position operating results and cash flows although we believe we have taken corrective actions to avoid similar manufacturing excursions in the future we cannot guarantee that our internal quality and testing programs will prevent a future manufacturing excursion from occurring any future manufacturing excursions including any commitments made by us to take remediation actions in respect of affected modules beyond our limited warranty could adversely impact our financial position operating results and cash flows 

although our power output warranty extends for 25 years our oldest solar modules manufactured during the qualification of our pilot production line have only been in use since 2001 because of the limited operating history of our solar modules we have been required to make assumptions regarding the durability and reliability of our solar modules our assumptions could prove to be materially different from the actual performance of our solar modules causing us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective solar modules in the future for example our glassonglass solar modules could break delaminate or experience power degradation in excess of expectations and our manufacturing operations could be subject to process variations that could cause affected modules to underperform compared to our expectations these risks could be amplified as we implement design and process changes in connection with our efforts to accelerate module conversion efficiency improvement and manufacturing production throughput as part of our long term strategic plan in addition as we increase the number of installations in nontemperate climates in accordance with our long term strategic plan we may experience increased failure rates due to deployment into such hot climates any widespread product failures may damage our market reputation cause our sales to decline require us to repair or replace the defective modules and cause us to take voluntary remedial measures beyond warranty terms to enhance customer satisfaction which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

in addition to our solar module warranty described above for solar power plants built by our epc team we currently typically provide a limited epc warranty against defects in workmanship engineering design and installation services under normal use and service conditions for a period of one to two years following the substantial completion of a solar power plant or an energized section of a solar power plant in resolving claims under both the workmanship and design warranties we have the option of either remedying the defect to the warranted level through repair refurbishment or replacement any widespread failures of solar power plants built by us could damage our market reputation cause our sales to decline cause us to incur unexpected costs to remedy defects or otherwise negatively affect our results of operations 

if our estimates regarding the future cost of collecting and recycling our solar modules are incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses at and from the time we realize our estimates are incorrect and face a significant unplanned cash burden 

we prefund our estimated future obligation for collecting and recycling our solar modules based on the present value of the expected future cost of collecting and recycling the modules which includes the cost of packaging the solar modules for transport the cost of freight from the solar module’s installation site to a recycling center the material labor and capital costs of the recycling process and an estimated third party profit margin and return on risk for collection and recycling we base our estimate on our experience collecting and recycling solar modules that do not pass our quality control tests and solar modules returned under our warranty and on our expectations about future developments in recycling technologies and processes and economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled if our estimates prove incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses at and from the time we realize our estimates are incorrect and also face a significant unplanned cash burden at the time we realize our estimates are incorrect or endusers return their solar modules which could harm our operating results in addition our endusers can return their solar modules at any time as a result we could be required to collect and recycle our solar modules earlier than we expect 

our failure to further refine our technology and develop and introduce improved pv products could render our solar modules or systems uncompetitive and reduce our net sales profitability andor market share 

we need to continue to invest significant financial resources in research and development to continue to improve our module conversion efficiency lower the levelized cost of electricity lcoe of our pv systems and otherwise keep pace with technological advances in the solar energy industry however research and development activities are inherently uncertain and we could encounter practical difficulties in commercializing our research results we seek to continuously improve our products and processes and the resulting changes carry potential risks in the form of delays additional costs or other unintended contingencies in addition our significant expenditures on research and development may not produce corresponding benefits other companies are developing a variety of competing pv technologies including copper indium gallium diselenide and amorphous silicon which could produce solar modules or systems that prove more costeffective or have better performance than our solar modules or systems in addition other companies could potentially develop a highly reliable renewable energy system that mitigates the intermittent power production drawback of many renewable energy systems or offers other valueadded improvements from the perspective of utilities and other system owners in which case such companies could compete with us even if the lcoe associated with such new system is higher than that of our systems as a result our solar modules or systems may be negatively differentiated or rendered obsolete by the technological advances of our competitors which would reduce our net sales profitability andor market share 

in addition we often forward price our products and services in anticipation of future cost reductions and thus an inability to further refine our technology and execute our longterm manufacturing cost and lcoe reduction objectives could adversely affect our margins and operating results 

our failure to protect our intellectual property rights may undermine our competitive position and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against third party allegations of infringement may be costly 

protection of our proprietary processes methods and other technology is critical to our business failure to protect and monitor the use of our existing intellectual property rights could result in the loss of valuable technologies we rely primarily on patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property we regularly file patent applications to protect inventions arising from our research and development and are currently pursuing such patent applications in the us and worldwide our existing patents and future patents could be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents or if patents are issued to us such patents may not be sufficient to provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies 

we also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position although we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our associates and third parties to protect our intellectual property such confidentiality agreements are limited in duration and could be breached and may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary manufacturing expertise adequate remedies may not be available in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise in addition others may obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or legal means the failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes equipment technology trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise methods and compounds could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries especially any developing countries into which we may expand our operations in some countries we have not applied for patent trademark or copyright protection 

  

third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary technologies or other intellectual property rights which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology can be difficult and expensive also litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others we cannot assure you that the outcome of such potential litigation will be in our favor such litigation may be costly and may divert management attention and other resources away from our business an adverse determination in any such litigation may impair our intellectual property rights and may harm our business prospects and reputation in addition we have no insurance coverage against litigation costs and would have to bear all costs arising from such litigation to the extent we are unable to recover them from other parties 

some of our key raw materials and components are either singlesourced or sourced from a limited number of third party suppliers and their failure to perform could cause manufacturing delays and impair our ability to deliver solar modules to customers in the required quality and quantities and at a price that is profitable to us 

our failure to obtain raw materials and components that meet our quality quantity and cost requirements in a timely manner could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture our solar modules or increase our manufacturing cost some of our key raw materials and components are either singlesourced or sourced from a limited number of third party suppliers as a result the failure of any of our suppliers to perform could disrupt our supply chain and impair our operations in addition some of our suppliers are small companies that may be unable to supply our increasing demand for raw materials and components as we continue to expand rapidly we may be unable to identify new suppliers or qualify their products for use on our production lines in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms a constraint on our production may cause us to be unable to meet our capacity ramp plan andor our obligations under our customer contracts which would have an adverse impact on our financial results 

a disruption in our supply chain for cadmium telluride our semiconductor material could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture solar modules and could adversely impact our profitability and longterm growth prospects 

a key raw material we use in our production process is a cadmium telluride compound tellurium one of the main components of cadmium telluride is mainly produced as a byproduct of copper refining and therefore its supply is largely dependent upon demand for copper our supply of cadmium telluride could be limited if any of our current suppliers or any of our future suppliers are unable to acquire an adequate supply of tellurium in a timely manner or at commercially reasonable prices if our competitors begin to use or increase their demand for cadmium telluride supply could be reduced and prices could increase if our current suppliers or any of our future suppliers cannot obtain sufficient tellurium they could substantially increase prices or be unable to perform under their contracts we may be unable to pass increases in the cost of our raw materials through to our customers because our customer contracts do not adjust for raw material price increases and are generally for a longer term than our raw material supply contracts a substantial increase in tellurium prices could adversely impact our profitability and longterm growth objectives 

  

our future success depends on our ability to effectively balance manufacturing production with market demand and when necessary continue to build new manufacturing plants over time in response to such demand and add production lines in a costeffective manner all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties 

our future success depends on our ability to effectively balance manufacturing production with market demand and increase both our manufacturing capacity and production throughput over time in a costeffective and efficient manner if we cannot do so we may be unable to expand our business decrease our manufacturing cost per watt maintain our competitive position satisfy our contractual obligations or sustain profitability see “an increased global supply of pv modules has caused and may continue to cause structural imbalances in which global pv module supply exceeds demand which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations” our ability to expand production capacity is subject to significant risks and uncertainties including the following 

 

 

 

 21 

 

 

 

 

 

if our future production lines are not built in line with our committed schedules it may impair our growth plans if our future production lines do not achieve operating metrics similar to our existing production lines our solar modules could perform below expectations and cause us to lose customers 

if we are unable to systematically replicate our production lines as necessary over time and achieve and sustain similar operating metrics in our future production lines as we have achieved at our existing production lines our manufacturing capacity could be substantially constrained our manufacturing costs per watt could increase and this may impair our growth plans andor cause us to lose customers resulting in lower net sales higher liabilities and lower net income than we anticipate for instance future production lines could produce solar modules that have lower conversion efficiencies higher failure rates and higher rates of degradation than solar modules from our existing production lines and we could be unable to determine the cause of the lower operating metrics or develop and implement solutions to improve performance in addition we might be unable to produce enough solar modules to satisfy our contractual requirements under our customer contracts 

some of our manufacturing equipment is customized and sole sourced if our manufacturing equipment fails or if our equipment suppliers fail to perform under their contracts we could experience production disruptions and be unable to satisfy our contractual requirements 

some of our manufacturing equipment is customized to our production lines based on designs or specifications that we provide to the equipment manufacturer which then undertakes a specialized process to manufacture the custom equipment as a result the equipment is not readily available from multiple vendors and would be difficult to repair or replace if it were to become damaged or stop working if any piece of equipment fails production along the entire production line could be interrupted in addition the failure of our equipment suppliers to supply equipment in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms could delay our expansion plans and otherwise disrupt our production schedule or increase our manufacturing costs all of which would adversely impact our financial results 

if we are unable to further increase the number of sellable watts per solar module and reduce our manufacturing cost per watt our profitability could decline 

our profitability could decline if we are unable to continue to reduce our manufacturing cost per watt furthermore our failure to reduce cost per watt by increasing our efficiency may impair our ability to enter new markets that we believe will require lower cost per watt for us to be competitive and may impair our growth plans 

we may be unable to manage the expansion of our operations effectively 

we expect to continue to expand our business in order to provide utilityscale pv generation to existing and new geographic markets and to maintain or increase market share to manage the continued expansion of our operations we will be required to continue to improve our operational and financial systems procedures and controls and expand train and manage our growing associate base our management will also be required to maintain and expand our relationships with customers suppliers and other third parties and attract new customers and suppliers in addition our current and planned operations personnel systems and internal controls and procedures might be inadequate to support our future growth if we cannot manage our growth effectively we may be unable to take advantage of market opportunities execute our business strategies or respond to competitive pressures 

implementing a new enterprise resource planning system could interfere with our business or operations and could adversely impact our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

we are in the process of implementing a new enterprise resource planning erp system phase 1 of this implementation was completed in the second half of 2010 and the second phase of this implementation was completed in the second half of 2011 this project requires significant investment of capital and human resources the reengineering of many processes of our business and the attention of many associates and managers who would otherwise be focused on other aspects of our business any disruptions delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of the new erp system could result in potentially much higher costs than we had anticipated and could adversely affect our ability to process customer orders ship products provide services and support to customers bill and track our customers fulfill contractual obligations file sec reports in a timely manner andor otherwise operate our business or otherwise impact our controls environment and any of these consequences could have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

our substantial international operations subject us to a number of risks including unfavorable political regulatory labor and tax conditions in foreign countries 

we have significant marketing distribution and manufacturing operations both within and outside the united states in 2011  43  of our net sales were generated from customers headquartered in the european union we expect to continue to expand our operations into china india other countries in europe asia the middle east and elsewhere as a result we will be subject to the legal political social tax and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions risks inherent to international operations include but are not limited to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

our business in foreign markets requires us to respond to rapid changes in market conditions in these countries our overall success as a global business depends in part on our ability to succeed in differing legal regulatory economic social and political conditions we may not be able to develop and implement policies and strategies that will be effective in each location where we 

do business 

risks related to our systems business 

project development or construction activities may not be successful and projects under development may not receive required permits real property rights power purchase agreements ppas interconnection and transmission arrangements or financing or construction may not commence or proceed as scheduled which could increase our costs and impair our ability to recover our investments 

the development and construction of solar power electric generation facilities and other energy infrastructure projects involve numerous risks we may be required to spend significant sums for land and interconnection rights preliminary engineering permitting legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built success in developing a particular project is contingent upon among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

successful completion of a particular project may be adversely affected by numerous factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if we are unable to complete the development of a solar power facility we fail to meet one or more agreed target construction milestone dates any agreed upon systemlevel capacity or energy output guarantees or warranties including for some projects twentyfive year energy performance or systemlevel module degradation warranties and guarantees or other contract terms or our projects cause grid interference or other damage we may be subject to forfeiture of significant deposits under power purchase agreements or interconnection agreements or termination of such agreements significant liquidated damages penalties andor other obligations under the epc agreement or other agreements relating to the project including obligations to repair replace andor supplement additional modules and balance of system materials for the project particularly if our liabilities are not capped under the terms of such agreement and we typically will not be able to recover our investment in the project some of these penalties might require us to repurchase the project from the buyer or to downsize the project under certain circumstances if we were required to repurchase a project we may have insufficient cash or capital resources necessary to make the repurchase payment or we may be unable to resell the project in a timely manner or on terms commercially satisfactory to us which would adversely impact our results of operations some of these investments are included as assets on our consolidated balance sheet under the line item “project assets” if we are unable to complete the development of a solar power project we may writedown or writeoff some or all of these capitalized investments which would have an adverse impact on our net income in the period in which the loss is recognized in 2012 we expect to invest a significant amount of capital to develop projects owned by us or third parties which may limit the availability of capital to use for other purposes such as contract damages or repurchase payments 

we may enter into fixedprice epc contracts in which we act as the general contractor for our customers in connection with the installation of their solar power systems all essential costs are estimated at the time of entering into the epc contract for a particular project and these are reflected in the overall fixedprice that we charge our customers for the project these cost estimates are preliminary and may or may not be covered by contracts between us or the subcontractors suppliers and other parties to the project in addition we require qualified licensed subcontractors to install most of our systems shortages of such skilled labor could significantly delay a project or otherwise increase our costs should miscalculations in planning a project occur including those due to unexpected increases in inflation commodity prices or labor costs or delays in execution occur and we are unable to increase commensurately the epc sales price we may not achieve our expected margins or we may be required to record a loss in the relevant fiscal period 

we may be unable to acquire or lease land obtain necessary interconnection and transmission rights andor obtain the approvals licenses permits and electric transmission grid interconnection and transmission rights necessary to build and operate pv power plants in a timely and cost effective manner and regulatory agencies local communities labor unions or other third parties may delay prevent or increase the cost of construction and operation of the pv plants we intend to build 

in order to construct and operate our pv plants we need to acquire or lease land and rights of way obtain interconnection rights and obtain all necessary local county state federal and foreign approvals licenses and permits as well as rights to interconnect the plants to the transmission grid and transmit energy generated from the plant we may be unable to acquire the land or lease interests needed may not obtain satisfactory interconnection rights may not receive or retain the requisite approvals permits licenses and interconnection and transmission rights or may encounter other problems which could delay or prevent us from successfully constructing and operating pv plants 

  

many of our proposed pv plants are located on or require access through public lands administered by federal and state agencies pursuant to competitive public leasing and rightofway procedures and processes the authorization for the use construction and operation of pv plants and associated transmission facilities on federal state and private lands will also require the assessment and evaluation of mineral rights private rightsofway and other easements environmental agricultural cultural recreational and aesthetic impacts and the likely mitigation of adverse impacts to these and other resources and uses the inability to obtain the required permits and potentially excessive delay in obtaining such permits due for example to litigation or third party appeals could prevent us from successfully constructing and operating pv plants in a timely manner and could result in a potential forfeiture of any deposit we have made with respect to a given project moreover project approvals subject to project modifications and conditions including mitigation requirements and costs could affect the financial success of a given project 

in addition local labor unions may increase the cost of andor lower the productivity of project development in canada california and elsewhere we may also be subject to labor unavailability andor increased union labor requirements due to multiple simultaneous projects in a geographic region 

lack of transmission capacity availability potential upgrade costs to the transmission grid and other systems constraints could significantly impact our ability to build pv plants and generate solar electricity power sales 

  

in order to deliver electricity from our pv plants to our customers our projects need to connect to the transmission grid the lack of available capacity on the transmission grid could substantially impact our projects and cause reductions in project size delays in project implementation increases in costs from transmission upgrades and potential forfeitures of any deposit we have made with respect to a given project these transmission issues as well as issues relating to the availability of large systems such as transformers and switch gear could significantly impact our ability to build pv plants and generate solar electricity sales 

  

our systems business is largely dependent on us and third parties arranging financing from various sources which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms or in insufficient amounts 

  

the construction of the large utilityscale solar power projects under development by us is expected in many cases to require project financing including nonrecourse project debt financing in the bank loan market and institutional debt capital markets uncertainties exist as to whether our projects will be able to access the debt markets in a magnitude sufficient to finance their construction if we are unable to arrange such financing or if it is only available on unfavorable terms we may be unable to fully execute our systems business plan in addition we generally expect to sell our projects by raising project equity capital from tax oriented strategic industry and other equity investors such equity sources may not be available or may only be available in insufficient amounts in which case our ability to sell our projects may be delayed or limited and our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected even if such financing sources are available the counterparty to many of our fixedprice epc contracts which own the project we are constructing are often special purpose vehicles that do not have significant assets other than their interests in the project and have pledged all or substantially all of these assets to secure the projectrelated debt and certain other sources of financing if the owner defaults on its payment or other obligations to us we may face difficulties in collecting payment of amounts due to us for the costs previously incurred or for the amounts previously expended or committed to be expended to purchase equipment or supplies including intercompany purchases of pv modules or for termination payments we are entitled to under the terms of the related epc contract if we are unable to collect the amounts owed to us or are unable to complete the project because of an owner default we may be required to record a charge against earnings related to the project which could result in a material loss 

  

in addition for projects to which we provide epc services but are not the project developer our epc activities are in many cases dependent on the ability of third parties to finance their pv plant projects which in turn is dependent on their ability to obtain financing for such purchases on acceptable terms depending on prevailing conditions in the credit markets interest rates and other factors such financing may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms or in insufficient amounts if third parties are limited in their ability to access financing to support their purchase of pv power plant construction services from us we may not realize the cash flows that we expect from such sales and this could adversely affect our ability to invest in our business andor generate revenue see also the risk factor above entitled “an increase in interest rates or lending rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets including a reduction in total tax equity availability could make it difficult for endusers to finance the cost of a pv system and could reduce the demand for our solar modules andor lead to a reduction in the average selling price for pv modules  ” 

  

developing solar power projects may require significant upfront investment prior to the signing of an epc contract and commencing construction which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

our solar power project development cycles which span the time between the identification of land and the commercial operation of a pv power plant project vary substantially and can take many months or years to mature as a result of these long project cycles we may need to make significant upfront investments of resources including for example payments for land rights large transmission and ppa deposits or other payments which may be nonrefundable in advance of the signing of epc contracts and commencing construction and the receipt of any revenue much of which is not recognized for several additional months or years following contract signing our potential inability to enter into sales contracts with potential customers after making such upfront investments could adversely affect our business and results of operations furthermore we may become constrained in our ability to simultaneously fund our other business operations and these systems investments through our long project development cycles 

our liquidity may be adversely affected to the extent the project sale market weakens and we are unable to sell our solar projects on pricing terms and timing commercially acceptable to us 

we may not be able to obtain longterm contracts for the sale of power produced by our projects at prices and on other terms favorable to attract financing and other investments 

obtaining longterm contracts for the sale of power produced by the projects at prices and on other terms favorable to us is essential for obtaining financing and commencing construction of our projects we must compete for power purchase agreements 

against other developers of solar and renewable energy projects further other sources of power such as natural gasfired power plants have historically been cheaper than the cost of solar power and power from certain types of projects such as natural gasfired power plants can be delivered on a firm basis the inability to compete successfully against other power producers or otherwise enter into ppas favorable to us would negatively affect our ability to develop and finance our projects and negatively impact our revenue in addition the availability of power purchase agreements is a function of a number of economic regulatory tax and public policy factors 

we may be subject to unforeseen costs liabilities or obligations when providing om services 

for solar power plants which we have developed and built we may provide ongoing om services to the system owner under fixedprice longterm service agreements pursuant to which we generally perform all scheduled and unscheduled maintenance for the system perform operating and other asset management services for the system and provide an availability guarantee for the system our costs to perform these services are estimated at the time of entering into the om agreement for a particular project and these are reflected in the fixedprice that we charge our customers under the om agreement we do not have extensive experience in performing om services for pv solar power plants and estimating actual costs to serve under our om agreements relative to the price that we charge our customers particularly in foreign jurisdictions in which we plan to offer pv systems solutions as part of our long term strategic plan should miscalculations in estimating these costs occur including those due to unexpected increases in inflation or labor or bos costs our growth strategy and results of operations could be adversely affected because of the longterm nature of these om agreements such as 25 years such adverse impacts on results of operations could be significant particularly if our liabilities are not capped or subject to an abovemarket liability cap under the terms of the om agreement we also could be subject to substantial costs liabilities or obligations in the event our solar systems do not meet any agreedupon systemlevel availability energy or performance guarantees or warranties 

other risks 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions and integration of these acquisitions may disrupt our business and management 

we have made several acquisitions in the last several years and in the future we may acquire additional companies project pipelines products or technologies or enter into joint ventures or other strategic initiatives we may not realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition and each acquisition has numerous risks these risks include the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 27 

 

 

mergers and acquisitions of companies are inherently risky and ultimately if we do not complete the integration of acquired businesses successfully and in a timely manner we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions to the extent anticipated which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our future success depends on our ability to retain our key associates and to successfully integrate them into our management team 

we are dependent on the services of our executive officers and other members of our senior management team the loss of one or more of these key associates or any other member of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on us we may not be able to retain or replace these key associates and we may not have adequate succession plans in place several of our current key associates including our executive officers are subject to employment conditions or arrangements that contain postemployment noncompetition provisions however these arrangements permit the associates to terminate their employment with us upon little or no notice and the enforceability of the noncompetition provisions is uncertain 

our current chief executive officer has been serving on an interim basis since october 2011 we could be subject to management disruptions or distractions resulting from any extended delay in hiring a new chief executive officer or from such new chief executive officer’s integration into the company 

if we are unable to attract train and retain key personnel our business may be materially and adversely affected 

our future success depends to a significant extent on our ability to attract train and retain management operations and technical personnel recruiting and retaining capable personnel particularly those with expertise in the pv industry and thinfilm technology are vital to our success there is substantial competition for qualified technical personnel and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain our technical personnel if we are unable to attract and retain qualified associates or otherwise experience labor disruptions our business may be materially and adversely affected 

certain types of services provided by onsite workers are subject to the davisbacon act the davisbacon act requires that a contractor pay all personnel assigned to the contract at least the prevailing wage and fringe benefits as established by and in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the department of labor we have an established policy pursuant to which we evaluate davisbacon act requirements and ensure our compliance with these requirements if the department of labor were to determine that anyone working under such contracts were not properly classified or were being paid the incorrect prevailing wage we could incur additional liability with respect to such workers any such liability incurred above our anticipated costs for these services could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we may be exposed to infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties which if determined adversely to us could cause us to pay significant damage awards or prohibit us from the manufacture and sale of our solar modules or the use of our technology 

our success depends largely on our ability to use and develop our technology and knowhow without infringing or misappropriating the intellectual property rights of third parties the validity and scope of claims relating to pv technology patents involve complex scientific legal and factual considerations and analysis and therefore may be highly uncertain we may be subject to litigation involving claims of patent infringement or violation of intellectual property rights of third parties the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits patent opposition proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings can be both costly and time consuming and may significantly divert the efforts and resources of our technical and management personnel an adverse determination in any such litigation or proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liability to third parties require us to seek licenses from third parties which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all or pay ongoing royalties require us to redesign our solar module or subject us to injunctions prohibiting the manufacture and sale of our solar modules or the use of our technologies protracted litigation could also result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of our solar modules until the resolution of such litigation 

currency translation and transaction risk may negatively affect our net sales cost of sales and gross margins and could result in exchange losses 

although our reporting currency is the us dollar we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most countries in which we operate as a result we are subject to currency translation and transaction risk for example 43  and 73  of our net sales were denominated in euros for the years ended december 31 2011  and december 31 2010  respectively and we expect a large percentage of our net sales to be outside the united states and denominated in foreign currencies in the future in addition our operating expenses for our manufacturing plants located outside the us and our operations for our systems business in foreign countries will generally be denominated in the local currency changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar could affect our net sales and cost of sales and could result in exchange gains or losses for example during 2011 our net sales was reduced by 63 million  due to a decrease in the blended exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar in addition we incur currency translation risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from our reporting currency for example our supply contracts specify pricing in euros through 2012 and do not adjust for changes in the us dollar to euro exchange rate we cannot accurately predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations 

we could also expand our business into emerging markets many of which have an uncertain regulatory environment relating to currency policy conducting business in such emerging markets could cause our exposure to changes in exchange rates to increase 

our ability to hedge foreign currency exposure is dependent on our credit profile with the banks that are willing and able to do business with us deterioration in our credit position or a significant tightening of the credit market conditions could limit our ability to hedge our foreign currency exposure and therefore result in exchange gains or losses 

the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in europe could adversely impact our business 

the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in europe and its impact on the balance sheets and lending practices of european banks in particular could negatively impact our access to and cost of capital and therefore could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and competitive position it could also similarly affect our customers and therefore limit the sales of our modules and demand for our systems business as well the european sovereign debt crisis may also cause european governments to reduce eliminate or allow to expire government subsidies and economic incentives for solar energy which could limit our growth or cause our net sales to decline and materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

the estate of john t walton and its affiliates have significant control over us and their interests may conflict with or differ from interests of other stockholders 

our largest stockholder the estate of john t walton and its affiliates including jcl holdings llc and jtw trust no 1 uad 91902 collectively the estate owned approximately 31  of our outstanding common stock at december 31 2011  as a result the estate has substantial influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of our directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions such as mergers tender offers and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets the interests of the estate could conflict with or differ from interests of other stockholders for example the concentration of ownership held by the estate could delay defer or prevent a change of control of our company or impede a merger takeover or other business combination which a majority of stockholders may view favorably 

if our goodwill or project assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 

we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements should we determine that our goodwill or project assets are impaired such a charge might have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations during the fourth quarter of 2011 we recorded goodwill impairment expense of 3934 million  related to our components reporting unit as discussed further in note 5 “goodwill and intangible assets”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2011  included in this annual report on form 10k 

  

as required by accounting rules we review our goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill is less than its carrying value factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill might not be recoverable include a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant decline in projections of future cash flows and lower future growth rates in our industry 

we review project assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable we consider a project commercially viable and recoverable if it is anticipated to be saleable for a profit once it is either fully developed or fully constructed if our projects are not considered commercially viable we would be required to 

impair the respective project assets 

unanticipated changes in our tax provisions the adoption of a new us tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge for inventory services licenses funding and other items in intercompany transactions we are subject to potential tax examinations in these various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges crossjurisdictional transfer pricing or other tax positions and assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these examinations in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision in accordance with asc 740 income taxes  however there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these potential examinations and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of examinations could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows in addition our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure loss of our malaysian tax holiday changes in the mix of earnings in countries with tax holidays or differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process in addition recently announced proposals for new us tax legislation could have a material effect on the results of our operations if enacted 

our credit agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business 

we may be unable to respond to changes in business and economic conditions engage in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us and obtain additional financing if needed because our revolving credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent and our malaysian and german facility agreements contain and any of our other future debt agreements may contain covenant restrictions that limit our ability to among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

under our revolving credit agreement and our malaysian and german facility agreements we are also subject to certain financial condition covenants our ability to comply with covenants under our credit agreements is dependent on our future performance which will be subject to many factors some of which are beyond our control including prevailing economic conditions in addition our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under these agreements and any of our other future debt agreements which if not cured or waived could permit the holders thereof to accelerate such debt and could cause crossdefaults under our other facility agreements and the possible acceleration of debt under such other facility agreements as well as crossdefaults under certain of our key project and operational agreements in addition we cannot assure you that events that occur within the company or in the industry or the economy as a whole will not constitute material adverse effects under these agreements if it is determined that a material adverse effect has occurred the lenders can under certain circumstances restrict future borrowings or accelerate the due date of outstanding loan balances if any of our debt is accelerated we may in the future not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt and we may experience crossdefaults under our other debt agreements or project and key operational agreements which could materially and negatively affect our business financial condition and results of operations 




 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

none 




 item 2 properties 

our principal properties consisted of the following 



 

 

 

in addition we lease small amounts of office and warehouse space in several other us and international locations

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of   operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements   and the related notes thereto included in this annual report on   form 10k in addition to historical consolidated financial information   the following discussion and analysis contains forwardlooking statements that   involve risks uncertainties and assumptions as described under the “note regarding   forwardlooking statements” that appears earlier in this annual report on   form 10k our actual results could differ materially from those   anticipated by these forwardlooking statements as a result of many factors   including those discussed under item 1a “risk factors” and elsewhere in this   annual report on form 10k 

overview 

we manufacture and sell solar modules with an advanced thinfilm semiconductor technology and we design construct and sell photovoltaic pv solar power systems 

in furtherance of our goal of delivering the lowest cost of solar electricity and achieving price parity with conventional fossilfuelbased peak electricity generation we are continually focused on reducing pv solar system costs in four primary areas module manufacturing balance of systems bos costs consisting of the costs of the components of a solar power system other than the solar modules such as inverters mounting hardware grid interconnection equipment wiring and other devices and installation labor costs project development costs and the cost of capital first with respect to our module manufacturing costs our advanced technology has allowed us to reduce our average module manufacturing costs to the lowest in the world for modules produced on a commercial scale based on publicly available information in 2011  our total average manufacturing costs were 075  per watt which we believe is less than those of traditional crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers by continuing to improve conversion efficiency and production line throughput lower material costs and drive volume scale to further decrease overhead costs we believe that we can further reduce our manufacturing costs per watt and maintain our cost advantage over traditional crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers second with respect to our bos costs by continuing to improve conversion efficiency leverage volume procurement around standardized hardware platforms and accelerate installation times we believe we can continue to make reductions in bos costs which represent over half of all of the costs associated with a typical utilityscale pv solar power system third with respect to our project development costs we seek optimal site locations in an effort to minimize transmission and permitting costs and to accelerate lead times to electricity generation finally with respect to our cost of capital by continuing to strengthen our financial position demonstrate the financial viability and operational performance of our utilityscale pv solar power plants and increase our pv solar power system operating experience we believe we can continue to lower the cost of capital associated with our pv solar power systems thereby further enhancing the economic viability of our projects and lowering the cost of electricity generated by pv solar power systems that incorporate our modules and technology 

we believe that combining our reliable lowcost module manufacturing capability with our systems business enables us to 

more rapidly reduce the price of solar electricity accelerate the adoption of our technology in utilityscale pv solar power systems identify and remove constraints on the successful migration to sustainable solar markets around the world and further our mission to create enduring value by enabling a world powered by clean affordable solar electricity 

  

we operate our business in two segments our components segment designs manufactures and sells solar modules primarily to solar project developers and system integrators through our systems segment we have the capability to provide a complete pv solar power system using our solar modules for utilityscale or large commercial systems providing a complete pv solar power system includes project development engineering procurement and construction epc operating and maintenance om services and monitoring and diagnostics md services when applicable and facilitating project finance when required we view the sale of solar modules from the components segment as the core driver of our profitability return on net assets and cash throughput we view our systems segment as an enabler to drive module throughput for our components business with the objective of achieving breakeven results before income taxes for our systems segment see also note 24 “segment and geographical information”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

market overview 

the solar industry experienced a challenging environment in 2011 the year was categorized by intense pricing competition bankruptcies of several solar companies many solar companies with little or no operating income and toward the end of the year announcements of manufacturing shutdowns or slowdowns at december 31 2011 the global pv industry consisted of more than 150 manufacturers of solar modules and cells in the aggregate these manufactuers have installed production capacity that significantly exceeded global demand in 2011 as a result industry average module pricing declined significantly as competitors reduced prices to sellthrough inventories in europe and elsewhere we believe this structural imbalance between supply and demand ie where production capacity significantly exceeds current global demand may continue for the foreseeable future and we expect it will continue to put pressure on pricing and our results of operations in 2012 in light of such market realities we have begun to execute our long term strategic plan under which we are focusing on our competitive strengths notably providing utilityscale pv generation solutions to sustainable geographic markets that have an immediate need for massscale pv electricity 

in addressing overall growing global demand for pv solar electricity we have developed a differentiated fully integrated systems business that can provide a lowcost turnkey utilityscale pv system solution for system owners and low cost electricity to utility endusers our fully integrated systems business has enabled us to increase module throughput drive cost reduction across the value chain identify and break constraints to sustainable markets and deliver the most compelling solutions to our customers and endusers with our fully integrated systems business we believe we are in a position to expand our business in transition markets and eventually economically sustainable markets in which support programs are minimal which are expected to develop in areas with abundant solar resources and sizable electricity demand we are committed to continually lowering the cost of solar electricity and in the long term we plan to compete on an economic basis with conventional fossilfuelbased peaking power generation 

  

the major european governments continue to seek to balance subsidy costs with their commitment to the eu directive’s goal of a 20 share of energy from renewable sources in the eu by 2020 governments in germany france and italy continue to evaluate changes to their fit structures market caps andor tender processes in many instances such proposed fit structures would particularly impact the competitiveness of our core offering of largescale free field pv systems and modules to be installed in such systems for instance the german government recently proposed significant and accelerated fit reductions for projects up to 10 mw and an elimination of fits for projects over 10 mw the resulting market uncertainties together with increased european financing environment constraints have contributed to demand pauses and increased customer difficulties in 2011 which in conjunction with increased industrywide manufacturing capacity have contributed to excess industry channel inventories in 2011 industry average module pricing declined significantly as competitors reduced prices to sellthrough inventories in europe and elsewhere in light of these factors lower industry module pricing while currently challenging for solar manufacturers in particular those with high cost structures is expected to continue to contribute to global market diversification and volume elasticity over time declining average selling prices are consistent with the erosion of one of the primary historical constraints to widespread solar market penetration namely its overall affordability in the near term however in light of continually evolving fit structures in our core european markets and increased industrywide manufacturing capacity it is uncertain whether growing demand from other countries and markets could absorb industrywide module supply without further inventory buildup andor price reductions which could adversely affect our results of operations if competitors reduce module pricing to levels below their manufacturing costs or are able to operate at minimal or negative operating margins for sustained periods of time our results of operations could be further adversely affected we continue to mitigate this uncertainty in part by executing on and building our north american utilityscale systems pipeline as a buffer against demand fluctuations in europe and elsewhere by accelerating our thinfilm module efficiency improvements and cost reduction roadmaps to increase our competitive advantage profitability and capital efficiency by adjusting our production plans and capacity utilization to match expected demand and by 

continuing the development of other geographic markets including those in india australia the middle east south america and china 

the development of market demand outside of the european union continued during 2011 in part aided by demand elasticity resulting from declining industry average selling prices which make solar power more affordable to new markets in india we entered into a 100 mw direct current dc module supply agreement the largest pv module supply agreement in india to date with one of india’s leading power generation companies in australia we were contracted to provide our modules epc and om services for australias first utilityscale solar power project a 10 mw alternating current ac solar farm that will help power the southern seawater desalination plant in western australia 

in north america we have continued to execute on our utilityscale systems pipeline we made substantial construction progress on the 290 mw ac agua caliente project in arizona during 2011 the financial impact of which is reflected below under “results of operations” on september 30 2011 we announced the sales and construction plans for what will be two of the world’s largest solar pv facilities both in california the two projects sold in the third quarter are the 550 mw ac desert sunlight solar farm located west of blythe california and the 230 mw ac antelope valley solar ranch one project located just north of los angeles california in january 2012 we announced completion of the sale of the 550 mw ac topaz solar farm located in san luis obispo county california 

in the pv module segment we continue to face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules and other types of solar modules and pv systems solar module manufacturers compete with one another in several product performance attributes including reliability and module cost per watt and with respect to solar power systems return on equity roe and levelized cost of electricity lcoe meaning the net present value of total life cycle costs of the solar power project divided by the quantity of energy which is expected to be produced over the system’s life the ability to expand manufacturing capacity quickly is another source of differentiation among solar module manufacturers and certain of our competitors may have a faster response time to capacity expansion than we do andor an ability to expand capacity in finer increments than we can we are the lowest cost pv module manufacturer in the solar industry for modules produced on a commercial scale based on publicly available information and our average manufacturing cost per watt declined from 077  during 2010  to 075  during 2011  this cost advantage is reflected in the price at which we sell our modules or fully integrated systems and enables our systems to compete favorably in respect of their roe or lcoe our cost competitiveness is based in large part on our proprietary technology which enables conversion efficiency improvements and enables us to produce a module in less than 25 hours using a continuous and highly automated industrial manufacturing process as opposed to a batch process our scale and our operational excellence in addition our modules use approximately 12 of the amount of semiconductor material ie silicon that is used to manufacture traditional crystalline silicon solar modules the cost of polysilicon is a significant driver of the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules and the timing and rate of change in the cost of silicon feedstock and polysilicon could lead to changes in solar module pricing levels polysilicon costs declined in 2011 contributing to a decline in our manufacturing cost advantage over crystalline silicon module manufacturers although we are not a crystalline silicon module manufacturer we estimate based on industry research and public disclosures of our competitors that a 10 per kg increase or decrease in the price of polysilicon could increase or decrease respectively our competitors’ manufacturing cost per watt by approximately 005  to 008  over time given the lower conversion efficiency of our modules compared to crystalline silicon modules there may be higher bos costs associated with systems using our modules thus to compete effectively on the basis of lcoe our modules need to maintain a certain cost advantage per watt compared to crystalline siliconbased modules during 2011  we reduced our manufacturing cost per watt by 3  from our cost per watt in 2010  and continued to reduce bos costs associated with systems using our modules 

while our modules currently enjoy competitive advantages in these product performance attributes there can be no guarantee that these advantages will continue to exist in the future to the same extent or at all any declines in the competitiveness of our products could result in additional margin compression further declines in the average selling prices of our solar modules erosion in our market share for modules decreases in the rate of revenue growth andor declines in overall revenues we have taken and continue to take various actions to mitigate the potential impact resulting from competitive pressures including adjusting our pricing policies as necessary in core market segments to drive module volumes accelerating progress along our module and bos cost reduction roadmaps and focusing our research and development on increasing the conversion efficiency of our solar modules 

  

as we expand our systems business into transition and sustainable markets we can offer value beyond the pv module reduce our exposure to moduleonly competition provide differentiated offerings to minimize the impact of solar module commoditization and provide comprehensive utilityscale pv systems solutions that significantly reduce solar electricity costs thus our systems business allows us to play a more active role than many of our competitors in managing the demand for our solar modules finally we seek to form and develop strong partner relationships with our customers and continue to develop our range of offerings including epc capabilities and om or md services in order to enhance the competitiveness of systems using our solar modules 

long term strategic plan 

   in december 2011 we announced a long term strategic plan long term strategic plan or ltsp with a goal to transition to primarily sustainable opportunities by the end of 2014 in executing the ltsp we will focus on providing solar pv generation solutions to sustainable geographic markets that we believe have a compelling need for massscale pv electricity including new markets throughout the americas asia the middle east and africa as part of our ltsp we expect to focus on opportunities in which our solar pv generation solutions will compete directly with fossil fuel offerings on a levelized cost of energy basis and decrease our focus on rooftop solar execution of the ltsp will entail a reallocation of resources around the globe in particular dedicating resources to regions such as latin america asia the middle east and africa where we have not traditionally conducted significant business to date we will evaluate and manage closely the appropriate level of resources required as we transition into and penetrate these specific markets we intend to dedicate significant capital and human resources to reduce the total installed cost of solar pv generation to optimize the design and logistics around our solar pv generation solutions and to ensure that our solutions integrate well into the overall electricity ecosystem of the specific region 

manufacturing capacity 

as of december 31 2011  we operated 36  production lines with an annual global manufacturing capacity of approximately 24  gw at our manufacturing plants in perrysburg ohio frankfurtoder germany and kulim malaysia in order to better align production with expected market demand we expect to produce between approximately 15 gw to 18 gw of solar modules in 2012 reflecting a manufacturing capacity utilization rate of approximately 60 to 70 compared to an expected manufacturing capacity of approximately 25 gw at the end of 2012 we expect to adjust such production plans in the future to match the then current expected market demand we plan to idle half of our production capacity in our frankfurtoder manufacturing facility for a period of time beginning in march 2012 we also plan to strategically idle additional production capacity to implement upgraded process technologies across existing manufacturing lines as part of our accelerated conversion efficiency improvement initiatives we plan to take the kulim production lines down on a rolling schedule for maintenance and equipment upgrades during 2012 the balancing of our production capabilities with market demand is a core component of our manufacturing capacity expansion strategy and our long term strategic plan to that end in february 2012 we decided not to proceed with our previously announced 4line plant in vietnam see note 4 “restructuring and acquisitions”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k we have also postponed the commissioning of our previously announced 4line plant in mesa arizona and the construction of our previously announced 2line plant in france until such time as global supply and demand dynamics support the additional manufacturing capacity in such geographic areas 

20082009 manufacturing excursion 

during the period from june 2008 to june 2009 a manufacturing excursion occurred whereby certain modules manufactured during that time period may experience premature power loss once installed in the field the root cause of the manufacturing excursion was identified and addressed in june 2009 beginning in 2009 we initiated a voluntary remediation program beyond our standard limited warranty pursuant to which we made commitments to customers with systems containing modules manufactured during the relevant period that we would cover certain costs of remediation efforts these remediation efforts included module removal replacement and logistical services and additional compensation payments to customers under certain circumstances our best estimate for costs of our voluntary remediation program as of and in each fiscal period in question has been based on evaluation and consideration of the thencurrently available information including the estimated number of affected modules in the field historical experience related to our voluntary remediation efforts customerprovided data related to potentially affected systems and the estimated costs of performing the logistical services covered under our remediation program 

as part of our voluntary remediation program we have worked with our customers to identify systems that are potentially affected by modules manufactured during the relevant period although we have been able to identify potentially affected systems the logistics costs of identifying testing and replacing individual affected modules within a site once they have been installed renders searching for and replacing individual affected modules impracticable for us when we are not the owner or operator of the site in many cases we elected to remediate our customers sites such that their overall site performance matched the customers expectations and in doing so we determined that it was more efficient to either replace all modules within a site for certain smaller sites below a size threshold or for larger sites to identify groups or strings of modules that are underperforming and replace the entire group or string with new modules the additional information provided from sites that we have already remediated and modules we have removed and tested permits us to identify the expected total number of modules necessary to remediate sites with potentially affected modules to match customers expectations and to refine the cost estimates for our voluntary remediation program as we have continued remediation efforts under our voluntary remediation program we have learned that in light of the impracticality of identifying and replacing individual affected models in order to remediate the energy loss impact at a system level we are required to remove and replace several modules in the aggregate including modules that might not have been affected by the manufacturing excursion removed modules are returned to us and are further tested to determine if the module can be resold or whether the module requires recycling under our solar module collection and recycling program 

in the fourth quarter of 2011 we accrued additional expenses in excess of standard product warranty liability relating to our voluntary remediation program a principal driver behind such additional accrual was our greater understanding as of yearend obtained through the processing of thousands of claims as described below of the number of modules not affected in the manufacturing excursion that needed to be removed and subsequently replaced in order for us to be able to identify and remedy the number of modules actually affected by the manufacturing excursion for additional information regarding accrued expenses in excess of standard product warranty liability relating to our voluntary remediation program see note 8 “consolidated balance sheet details”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k our voluntary remediation program and the related manufacturing excursion also resulted in changes in estimates to our product warranty liability for additional information regarding these changes see note 16 “commitments and contingencies”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

in response to our communications to customers regarding our intent to undertake a voluntary remediation program we received more than five thousand customer claims which covered an installed base greater than our entire production output during the june 2008  june 2009 timeframe in our processing of these claims to date we have determined that we will take remediation actions in accordance with our voluntary remediation program with respect to approximately 1100 of such claims approximately an additional 200 claims could pending receipt of additional information qualify for remediation and the balance of approximately 4000 claims have been or will be rejected as they did not meet the criteria for participation in our voluntary remediation program including claims containing insufficient data necessary to evaluate them we have expensed 2157 million total todate for the estimated costs of remediating systems affected by modules manufactured during the relevant period including 1456 million for remediation expenses beyond our limited warranty obligations and 701 million in product warranty expense reflecting the net increase in the expected number of replacement modules required in connection with our remediation efforts as described in more detail under “results of operationsfiscal years ended december 31 2011 and december 31 2010cost of sales” and “results of operationsfiscal years ended december 31 2011 and december 31 2010selling general and administrative” 

in addition to those customers with systems containing modules affected by the manufacturing excursion that we have already identified we are working with a number of additional customers who have made claims and may have affected modules we are in the process of gathering information to complete our analysis of these remaining claims based upon our experience to date with our remediation approach together with the data currently available we estimate that if we ultimately remediate these systems under our current remediation program we could incur additional costs of up to approximately 44 million  this includes approximately 24 million  beyond our limited warranty obligations in connection with these claims including the costs of actual remediation and the costs of additional compensation payments to customers under certain circumstances and approximately 20 million  related to additional product warranty liability 

module installation in nontemperate climates 

we believe our pv modules are potentially subject to increased failure rates in hot climates this assumption is based on technical literature data that we have developed internally including through acceleratedlife testing our analysis of modules returned under warranty and our analysis of performance data from systems that we monitor under om agreements processes that are accelerated by higher ambient temperatures include stress corrosion cracking in glass polymer creepage and impurity diffusion processes for more information about risks related to thin film module product performance please see item 1a “ thinfilm technology has a short history and our thinfilm technology and solar modules and systems may perform below expectations problems with product quality or performance may cause us to incur significant andor unexpected warranty and related expenses damage our market reputation and prevent us from maintaining or increasing our market share ” first solar has an extensive deployment history in temperate climates such as europe our deployed volume into hot climates such as the southwestern united states is mostly recent we have increased our warranty reserve by 378 million to reflect our exposure to this shift in the mix of geographic regions where our modules are installed as we execute on our long term strategic plan we expect to install higher volumes in nontemperate climates as part of our utilityscale offerings in asia the middle east africa australia and the southwestern united states accordingly we will continue to review our warranty reserve in the future to reflect actual installations in such nontemperate climates and adjust such reserve as appropriate for additional information regarding changes in estimates to our product warranty liability see note 16 “commitments and contingencies”    to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

financial operations overview 

the following describes certain line items in our statement of operations and some of the factors that affect our operating results 

net sales 

components business 

during 2011 the majority of our net sales were generated from the sale of solar modules we generally price and sell our solar modules per watt of power during 2011  we sold the majority of our solar modules to solar power system project developers system integrators and operators headquartered in germany france india italy and the united states which either resell our solar modules to endusers or integrate them into power plants that they own operate or sell 

as of december 31 2011  we had supply contracts for the sale of solar modules with thirteen  solar power system project developers and system integrators headquartered within the european union expiring at the end of 2012 supply contracts our sales prices under the supply contracts are primarily denominated in euros exposing us to risks from currency exchange rate fluctuations during the year ended december 31 2011  78  of our components business net sales were denominated in euros and were subject to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and us dollar in the past we have amended pricing volume and other terms in our supply contracts on a prospective basis in order to remain competitive and we may decide in the future to further amend these contracts in order to address the highly competitive environment for solar modules effective september 30 2011 the rebate program where we provided certain of our customers a price rebate for solar modules purchased from us ended we have begun early stage discussions with our customers under current supply contracts regarding replacement contracts for periods covering 2013 and beyond but such replacement contracts are not expected to be longterm in nature for additional information regarding the rebate program see note 8 “consolidated balance sheet details”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

we also enter into onetime module sales agreements with customers for specific projects 

  

under our customer contracts we transfer title and risk of loss to the customer and recognize revenue upon shipment our customers do not have extended payment terms or rights of return under these contracts 

during 2011  the principal third party customers of our components business were edf en development  and belectric  during 2011  each of these two customers individually accounted for more than 10  of our components segment’s net sales each of our other customers individually accounted for less than 10  of our net sales during 2011  

systems business 

through our fully integrated systems business we provide a complete solar power system solution using our solar modules which may include project development epc services om services when applicable and project finance when required 

net sales from our systems segment may include the following types of transactions 



net sales from our systems segment are impacted by numerous factors including the magnitude and effectiveness of renewable portfolio standards economic incentives the competitiveness of our systems offering in comparison to our competitors solar systems and other forms of electricity generation and other pv system demand drivers 

during 2011  the majority of our systems business sales were generated in north america net sales from our systems business during 2010 resulted primarily from revenue recognition for utility scale solar power projects in north america and europe during 2009 net sales from our systems business resulted primarily from the sale of two utilityscale solar power systems in the fourth fiscal quarter to utilities in the united states and canada 

we recognize revenue for arrangements entered into by the systems business generally using two revenue recognition models following the guidance in asc 605 accounting for longterm construction contracts  or for arrangements which include land or land rights asc 360 accounting for sales of real estate 

for construction contracts that do not include land or land rights and thus are accounted for under asc 605 we use the percentageofcompletion method using actual costs incurred over total estimated costs to complete a project including module costs as our basic accounting policy unless we cannot make reasonably dependable estimates of the costs to complete the contract in which case we would use the completed contract method we periodically revise our contract cost and profit estimates and we immediately recognize any losses that we identify on such contracts incurred costs include all direct materials costs for solar modules labor subcontractor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance such as indirect labor supplies and tools we recognize direct material costs and costs for solar modules as incurred costs when the direct materials and solar modules have been installed when construction contracts or other agreements specify that title to direct materials and solar modules transfers to the customer before installation has been performed we defer revenue and associated costs and recognize revenue once those materials are installed and have met all other revenue recognition requirements we consider direct materials to be installed when they are permanently attached or fitted to the solar power systems as required by engineering designs 

  

for arrangements recognized under asc 360 typically when we have gained control of land or land rights we record the sale as revenue using one of the following revenue recognition methods based upon the substance and the terms and conditions of such arrangements 

we apply the percentageofcompletion method to certain arrangements covered under asc 360 when the sale has been consummated when we have transferred the usual risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer the initial or continuing investment criteria have been met we have the ability to estimate our costs and progress toward completion and other revenue recognition criteria have been met depending on the value of the initial and continuing payment commitment by the buyer we may align our revenue recognition and release of project assets to cost of sales with the receipt of payment from the buyer for sales arrangements accounted for under asc 360 

we record revenue for certain other arrangements covered under asc 360 after construction of a project is complete we have transferred the usual risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer and we have received payment from the buyer 

the below tables summarize as of february 28 2012  our 27  gw ac utility systems advanced project pipeline as of december 31 2011 for such pipeline we have recognized revenue with respect to the equivalent of approximately180 mw ac such amount refers to the total cumulative revenue recognized with respect to projects in our pipeline divided by total contracted revenue for such projects multiplied by the total mw ac for such projects

cost of sales 

components business 

our cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials and components for manufacturing solar modules such as tempered back glass transparent conductive oxide coated front glass cadmium telluride laminate connector assemblies laminate edge seal and other items our cost of sales also includes direct labor for the manufacturing of solar modules and manufacturing overhead such as engineering equipment maintenance environmental health and safety quality and production control and procurement costs cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing plant and equipment and facilityrelated expenses in addition we accrue warranty and solar module collection and recycling costs to our cost of sales 

overall we expect our cost of sales per watt to continue to decrease over the next several years due to an increase in sellable 

watts per solar module an increase in unit output per production line and more efficient absorption of fixed costs driven by economies of scale this expected decrease in cost per watt would be partially offset during periods in which we underutilize manufacturing capacity 

systems business 

within our systems business projectrelated costs include standard epc costs consisting primarily of bos costs for inverters electrical and mounting hardware project management and engineering costs and installation labor costs site specific costs and development costs including transmission upgrade costs interconnection fees and permitting costs as further described in note 24 “segment and geographical information”  to our consolidated financial statements included within this annual report on form 10k at the time when all revenue recognition criteria are met we include the sale of our solar modules manufactured by our components business and used by our systems business excluding intercompany profit as net sales of our components business therefore the related cost of sales are also included within our components business at that time 

deferred project costs represent i costs that we capitalize for arrangements that we account for as real estate transactions after we have entered into a definitive sales arrangement but before we have met all criteria to recognize the sale as revenue ii recoverable precontract costs that we capitalize for arrangements accounted for as longterm construction contracts prior to entering into a definitive sales agreement or iii costs that we capitalize for arrangements accounted for as longterm construction contracts after we have signed a definitive sales agreement but before all revenue recognition criteria have been met as of december 31 2011  deferred project costs capitalized on our balance sheet were 3204 million  of which 1977 million  was classified as current and 1227 million  was classified as noncurrent as of december 31 2010  our deferred project costs were 144 million  all of which was classified as current

gross profit is affected by numerous factors including our module average selling prices foreign exchange rates the existence and effectiveness of subsidies and other economic incentives competitive pressures market demand market mix our manufacturing costs bos costs project development costs the effective utilization of our production facilities and the ramp of production on new plants due to a reduced ability to absorb fixed costs until full production volumes are reached gross profit is also subject to competitive pressures most notably pressures resulting from declines in industry average selling prices gross profit margin is also affected by the mix of net sales generated by our components and systems businesses our systems business generally operates at a lower gross profit margin due to the passthrough nature of certain bos components procured from third parties gross profit for our systems business excludes the sales and cost of sales for solar modules which we include in the gross profit of our components business 

research and development 

research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and personnelrelated costs the cost of products materials and outside services used in our process and product research and development activities we acquire equipment for general use in further process developments and record the depreciation of this equipment as research and development expense currently the majority of our research and development expenses are attributable to our components segment 

see note 4 “restructuring and acquisitions”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

we maintain a number of programs and activities to improve our technology and processes in order to enhance the performance and reduce the costs of our solar modules and pv systems using our modules 

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated costs professional fees insurance costs travel expenses and other selling expenses we expect selling expenses to increase in the near term in order to support the planned growth of our business as we expand our sales and marketing efforts over time we expect selling general and administrative expense to decline as a percentage of net sales as our net sales increase 

  

our systems business has certain of its own dedicated administrative key functions such as accounting legal finance project finance human resources procurement and marketing costs for such functions are recorded and included within selling general and administrative costs for our systems segment our corporate key functions consist primarily of companywide corporate tax corporate treasury corporate accountingfinance corporate legal investor relations corporate communications and executive 

management functions based primarily on the significant growth of the systems business we have concluded the corporate functions benefit both the components and systems segments we allocate corporate costs to the components or systems segment as part of selling general and administrative costs based upon the estimated benefits to each segment from the corporate functions 

production startup 

production startup expense consists primarily of salaries and personnelrelated costs and the cost of operating a production line before it has been qualified for full production including the cost of raw materials for solar modules run through the production line during the qualification phase it also includes all expenses related to the selection of a new site and the related legal and regulatory costs and the costs to maintain our plant replication program to the extent we cannot capitalize these expenditures we incurred production startup expense of 139 million  during the year ended december 26 2009  related to plant four of our malaysian manufacturing center and our ohio plant expansion we incurred production startup expense of 194 million  during the year ended december 31 2010  related to our eightline malaysian fourline german oneline ohio and twoline france manufacturing expansions including legal regulatory and personnel costs production startup expense for the year ended december 31 2011  was 336 million  related to our eightline malaysian fourline german twoline france fourline vietnam and fourline arizona manufacturing expansions including legal regulatory and personnel costs in general we expect production startup expense per production line to be higher when we build an entirely new manufacturing facility compared with the addition of new production lines at an existing manufacturing facility primarily due to the additional infrastructure investment required when building an entirely new facility production startup expense is attributable to our components segment the balancing of our production capabilities with market demand is a core component of our manufacturing capacity expansion strategy and our long term strategic plan to that end in february 2012 we decided not to proceed with our previously announced 4line plant in vietnam see note 4 “restructuring and acquisitions”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k we have also postponed the commissioning of our previously announced 4line plant in mesa arizona and the construction of our previously announced 2line plant in france until such time as global supply and demand dynamics support the additional manufacturing capacity in those geographic areas 

goodwill impairment 

during the fourth quarter of 2011 we determined that goodwill related to our components segment was impaired and recorded expense of 3934 million 

restructuring 

in december 2011 executive management approved a set of restructuring initiatives intended to accelerate operating cost reductions and improve overall operating efficiency in connection with these restructuring initiatives we incurred total charges of 604 million  in the fourth quarter of 2011 and we expect to incur an additional 16 million  in 2012 related to such restructuring initiatives these charges consisted primarily of i 536 million  of asset impairment and related charges due to a significant reduction in certain research and development activities that had been focused on an alternative pv product and ii 68 million  in severance benefits to terminated employees as described below most of which is expected to be paid out by the end of 2012 

we are refocusing our research and development center in santa clara california on the development of advanced cdte pv technologies compared to a broader research and development effort up until now we eliminated 101  positions companywide as part of the restructuring initiatives 

         in february 2012 executive management completed an evaluation of and approved a set of manufacturing capacity and other initiatives primarily intended to adjust our previously planned manufacturing capacity expansions and global manufacturing footprint the primary goal of these initiatives is to better align production capacity and geographic location of such capacity with expected geographic market requirements and demand in connection with these initiatives we expect to incur total charges to operating expense of up to 135 million  during the first half of 2012 and up to 140 million  in total by the time such initiatives are complete which is expected to be by the end of 2012 these expected charges consist primarily of i between 60 million  to 100 million  of asset impairment and related charges due to our decision in february 2012 not to proceed with our 4line manufacturing plant under construction in vietnam carrying value of 1344 million  as of december 31 2011 ii between 20 million  and 30 million  of asset impairment and related charges due to our decision in february 2012 to cease the use of certain manufacturing machinery and equipment intended for use in the production of certain components of our solar modules carrying value of 285 million  as of december 31 2011 and iii between 5 million  to 10 million  of asset impairment and related charges primarily due to our decision in february 2012 to cease use of certain other longlived assets carrying value of 72 million  as of december 31 2011 

based upon expected future market demand and our focus on providing utilityscale pv generation solutions primarily to 

sustainable geographic markets we have decided not to proceed with our previously announced 4line plant in vietnam we expect to actively market the plant for sale after all necessary construction has been completed which is currently expected to occur in the first half of 2012 once certain criteria are met including the completion of all necessary construction activities and active marketing of the vietnam plant we expect to meet the “held for sale” criteria at which time we expect to record an impairment charge based primarily upon the thencurrent fair value of the vietnam plant 

foreign currency gain loss 

foreign currency gain loss consists of gains and losses resulting from holding assets and liabilities and conducting transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies 

interest income 

interest income is earned on our cash cash equivalents marketable securities and restricted cash and investments interest income also includes interest received from notes receivable and interest collected for late customer payments 

interest expense net 

interest expense net of amounts capitalized is incurred on various debt financings we capitalize interest expense into our property plant and equipment project assets and deferred project costs when such costs qualify for interest capitalization 

income tax expense 

  

income taxes are imposed on our income by taxing authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate principally the united states germany and malaysia the statutory federal corporate income tax rate in the united states is 350  while the tax rates in germany and malaysia are approximately 285  and 250  respectively in malaysia we have been granted a longterm tax holiday scheduled to expire in 2027  pursuant to which substantially all of our income earned in malaysia is exempt from income tax 

critical accounting estimates 

in preparing our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap we make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts of reported assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities in our financial statements and the related notes thereto some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in the selection of the appropriate assumptions for making these estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty we base our judgments and estimates on our historical experience our forecasts and other available information as appropriate our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2011  included in this annual report on form 10k 

our critical accounting estimates which require the most significant management estimates and judgment in determining amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k are as follows 

revenue recognition  percentage of completion method we recognize revenue for arrangements entered into by the systems business generally using two revenue recognition models following the guidance in asc 605 accounting for longterm construction contracts  or for arrangements which include land or land rights asc 360 accounting for sales of real estate we use the percentageofcompletion method using actual costs incurred over total estimated costs to complete a project including module costs for our construction contracts that do not include land or land rights and thus are accounted for under asc 605 as our basic accounting policy unless we cannot make reasonably dependable estimates of the costs to complete the contract in which case we would use the completed contract method we periodically revise our contract cost and profit estimates and we immediately recognize any losses that we identify on such contracts such estimates include significant judgment incurred costs include all direct materials costs for solar modules labor subcontractor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance such as indirect labor supplies and tools we recognize direct material costs and costs for solar modules as incurred costs when the direct materials and solar modules have been installed when construction contracts or other agreements specify that title to direct materials and solar modules transfers to the customer before installation has been performed we defer revenue and associated costs and recognize revenue once those materials are installed and have met all other revenue recognition requirements we consider direct materials to be installed when they are permanently attached or fitted to the solar power systems as required by engineering designs 

  

we also apply the percentageofcompletion method to certain arrangements covered under asc 360 when the sale has been consummated when we have transferred the usual risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer the initial or continuing investment criteria have been met we have the ability to estimate our costs and progress toward completion and other revenue recognition criteria have been met such estimates include significant judgment depending on the value of the initial and continuing payment commitment by the buyer we may align our revenue recognition and release of project assets to cost of sales with the receipt of payment from the buyer for sales arrangements accounted for under asc 360 

accrued solar module collection and recycling liability at the time of sale we recognize an expense for the estimated fair value of our future obligation for collecting and recycling the solar modules that we have sold when they have reached the end of their useful lives we base our estimate of the fair value of our collection and recycling obligations on the present value of the expected probability weighted future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules which includes the cost of packaging the solar modules for transport the cost of freight from the solar module installation sites to a recycling center the material labor and capital costs of the recycling process and an estimated thirdparty profit margin and return on risk for collection and recycling services we base this estimate on our experience collecting and recycling our solar modules and on our expectations about future developments in recycling technologies and processes about economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled and about the expected timing of when our solar modules will be returned for recycling in the periods between the time of our sales and our settlement of the collection and recycling obligations we accrete the carrying amount of the associated liability by applying the discount rate used for its initial measurement during the fourth quarter of 2011 we completed an annual cost study and updated our estimates for the expected future recycling costs as a result we adjusted our module collection and recycling liability accordingly at december 31 2011  our estimate of the fair value of our liability for collecting and recycling solar modules was 1674 million  a 10 decrease in our estimate of the future cost of collecting and recycling a solar module would reduce this estimated liability by 167 million to 1507 million a 10 increase in our estimate of the future cost of collecting and recycling a solar module would increase this estimated liability by 167 million to 1841 million 

product warranties and manufacturing excursion  we have historically provided a limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for 5 years following delivery to the owners of our solar modules for solar module sales made subsequent to september 30 2011 we have increased the limited warranty we provide against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions from 5 years to 10 years 

we also warrant to the owners of our solar modules that solar modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 90  of their power output rating during the first 10 years following their installation and at least 80  of their power output rating during the following 15 years in resolving claims under both the defects and power output warranties we have the option of either repairing or replacing the covered solar module or under the power output warranty providing additional solar modules to remedy the power shortfall for modules sold after september 30 2011 we also have the option to make a payment for the then current market module price to resolve claims our warranties are automatically transferred from the original purchasers of our solar modules to subsequent purchasers upon resale when we recognize revenue for module sales we accrue a liability for the estimated future costs of meeting our limited warranty obligations for those modules we make and revise this estimate based on the number of our solar modules under warranty at customer locations our historical experience with warranty claims our monitoring of field installation sites our inhouse testing of and the expected future performance of our solar modules and our estimated permodule replacement cost such estimates have changed and may in the future change based primarily upon additional information received from completed voluntary remediation efforts at certain sites and from the evaluation of information available after completion of the analysis on certain outstanding claims such additional information provides further understanding of and additional data regarding the number of replacement modules expected to be required in connection with our voluntary remediation efforts 

we must also make an estimate for the cost of the remediation program described further in “—20082009 manufacturing excursion” our estimates for the remediation program have changed and may in the future change significantly in light of our ongoing remediation efforts and our continued analysis of remaining claims in the fourth quarter of 2011 we processed approximately 40 of the claims related to the manufacturing excursion that we received in light of the additional data we gained from processed claims as well as experience from our remediation efforts our estimates have been subject to change 

our estimate for such remediation costs is based on evaluation and consideration of currently available information including the estimated number of affected modules in the field historical experience related to our remediation efforts customerprovided data related to potentially affected systems the estimated costs of performing the removal replacement and logistical services and the postsale expenses covered under our remediation program 

accounting for income taxes  we are subject to the income tax laws of the united states and its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations these tax laws are complex and subject 

to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining our provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit we regularly assess the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and subsequent years’ examinations and we record tax liabilities as appropriate 

 we establish liabilities for potential additional taxes that may arise out of tax audits in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification topic asc 740 income taxes  once established we adjust the liabilities when additional information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring an adjustment significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the actual cost of a legal claim tax assessment or regulatory fine or penalty may ultimately be materially different from our recorded liabilities if any 

 in preparing our consolidated financial statements we calculate our income tax expense based on our interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business this requires us to estimate our current tax obligations and the realizability of uncertain tax positions and to assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities the net current amount of which we show as a component of current assets or current liabilities and the net noncurrent amount of which we show as other assets or other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 

we must also assess the likelihood that each of our deferred tax assets will be realized to the extent we believe that realization of any of our deferred tax assets is not more likely than not we establish a valuation allowance when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a reporting period we generally record a corresponding tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations conversely to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed which generally reduces our overall income tax expense 

we also consider the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and determine whether such amounts are indefinitely reinvested outside the united states we have concluded that except for the earnings of our canadian subsidiary and with respect to previously taxed income all such accumulated earnings are currently indefinitely reinvested accordingly no additional taxes have been accrued that might be incurred if such amounts were repatriated to the united states if our intention to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries changes additional taxes may be required to be accrued see note 20 “income taxes”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

longlived asset impairment  we are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of longlived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified we review our longlived assets each quarter to assess whether impairment indicators are present we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred 

for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss a longlived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities we must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 

for longlived assets when impairment indicators are present we compare undiscounted future cash flows including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value to the asset groups carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable this assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the assets to be held and used assessments also consider changes in asset group utilization including the temporary idling of capacity and the expected timing of placing this capacity back into production 

for an asset group that fails the test of recoverability described above the estimated fair value of longlived assets may be determined using an “income approach” “market approach” “cost approach” or a combination of one or more of these approaches as appropriate for the particular asset group being reviewed all of these approaches start with the forecast of expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of longlived assets if there is an impairment a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the asset groups fair value and carrying value this may require judgment in estimating future cash flows and relevant discount rates and residual values applied in the income approach used in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used 

our estimates are based upon our historical experience our commercial relationships and available information about future trends we believe fair value assessments are most sensitive to market changes and the corresponding impact on volume and average selling prices and that these are more subjective than manufacturing cost and other assumptions we believe our current 

assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate 

goodwill  goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the estimated fair value assigned to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed we do not amortize goodwill but instead are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter and if necessary we would record any impairment in accordance with asc 350 intangibles   goodwill and other  we will perform an impairment test between scheduled annual tests if facts and circumstances indicate that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill is less than its carrying value 

  

         we may first make a qualitative assessment of whether it is morelikelythannot that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying value to determine whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test the qualitative impairment test includes considering various factors including macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions cost factors a sustained share price or market capitalization decrease and any reporting unit specific events if it is determined through the qualitative assessment that a reporting units fair value is morelikelythannot greater than its carrying value the twostep impairment test is not required if the qualitative assessment indicates it is morelikelythannot that a reporting units fair value is not greater than its carrying value we must perform the twostep impairment test we may also elect to proceed directly to the twostep impairment test without considering such qualitative factors 

the first step in a twostep impairment test is the comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill our two reporting units are the components and systems reporting units which are the same as our reportable segments as described in note 24 “segment and geographical information” to our consolidated financial statements in accordance with the authoritative guidance over fair value measurements we define the fair value of a reporting unit as the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date we primarily use the income approach methodology of valuation which includes the discounted cash flow method and the market approach methodology of valuation which considers values of comparable businesses to estimate the fair values of our reporting units we do not believe that a cost approach is relevant to measuring the fair values of our reporting units 

significant management judgment is required when estimating the fair value of our reporting units including the forecasting of future operating results the discount rates and expected future growth rates that we use in the discounted cash flow method of valuation and in the selection of comparable businesses that we use in the market approach if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value assigned to that unit goodwill is not impaired and no further analysis is required 

if the carrying value assigned to a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value in the first step then we are required to perform the second step of the impairment test in this step we assign the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in step one to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit as if a market participant just acquired the reporting unit in a business combination the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit determined in the first step of the impairment test over the total amount assigned to the assets and liabilities in the second step of the impairment test represents the implied fair value of goodwill if the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference if there is no such excess then all goodwill for a reporting unit is considered impaired 

during the fourth quarter of 2011 we determined through a twostep goodwill impairment test that the 3934 million in goodwill for our components reporting unit was fully impaired as discussed further in note 5 “goodwill and intangible assets” to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2011 included in this annual report on form 10k 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december 31 2011  december 31 2010  and december 26 2009  



fiscal years ended december 31 2011  and december 31 2010   

  

net sales 



the 8  increase in net sales for 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to an 85 increase in net sales by our systems business and a 7 increase in the volume in watts of solar modules sold partially offset by a 10 decrease in our module average selling price asp 

the 10 decline in our module asp was attributable to a 15 decrease of our nonsystems module asp due to competitive pressures and geographic mix partially offset by a 5 increase of our systems module asp driven primarily by the mix of systems projects 

  

net sales for our systems business increased by 3200 million during 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase in the number and size of the various utilityscale solar power systems under construction by us in 2011 

cost of sales 



the increase in cost of sales was primarily due to increases of 2189 million in bos and other construction costs from an increase in the number and size of the various utilityscale solar power systems under construction by us in 2011 712 million in personnel and other manufacturing costs related to the increase in volume of modules sold 316 million of expense from voluntary remediation efforts for module removal replacement and logistical services related to the manufacturing excursion discussed in “—20082009 manufacturing excursion” above 701 million of expense due to an increase in the expected number of replacement modules required for such remediation efforts 378 million for an increase in the expected number of warranty claims primarily related to potential module performance in certain climates as described in “module installation in nontemperate climates” above and 138 million for certain inventory writedowns primarily related to refurbished modules returned under the voluntary remediation efforts as a result of asp declines during the fourth quarter of 2011 these increases were partially offset by continuous cost reductions in our manufacturing operations 

we expensed 997 million totaltodate in connection with our voluntary remediation efforts for module removal replacement and logistical services related to the manufacturing excursion and 701 million in warranty expense accruals related to an increase in the expected number of required replacement modules in connection with our remediation efforts such amounts include 1323 million of expense in 2011 and 940 million in expenses in the fourth quarter of 2011 reflecting our most recent best estimate for these remediation efforts see note 8 “consolidated balance sheet details”  and note 16 “commitments and contingencies”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2011  included in this annual report on form 10k 

our average manufacturing cost per watt declined by 002  per watt or 3  from 077  in 2010  to 075  in 2011  and included 001  of noncash stock based compensation 

gross profit 



  

gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased by 111 percentage points in 2011 compared with 2010 this decrease was attributable to the followi ng a 61 percentage point reduction due to a decline in our module asp a 15 percentage point reduction relating to voluntary remediation efforts for affected module removal replacement and logistical services related to the manufacturing excursion discussed in item 7 “20082009 manufacturing excursion” in this annual report on form 10k a 33 percentage point reduction due to an increase in the expected number of required replacement modules for such excursion related remediation efforts a 18 percentage point reduction due to an increase in expected warranty claims for potential module performance in certain climates and a 06 percentage point reduction due to inventory writedowns these decreases were partially offset by a 19 percentage point increase attributable to continued manufacturing scale and reductions in our manufacturing cost per watt a 02 percentage point increase due to segment mix between our components and systems businesses and a 01 percentage point increase due to the weakening of the euro against the us dollar exchange rate we expect that gross profit will continue to be impacted in future periods by the product mix between our components and systems busine sses 

  

research and development 



the increase in research and development expense was primarily due to a 193 million increase in personnelrelated expenses including a 45 million increase in sharebased compensation expense resulting from hiring for increased investment in various research and development projects a 256 million increase in testing and qualification material cost and a 23 million increase in facilities and utilities expenses these increases were partially offset by a decrease in other expenses of 15 million during 2011 we continued the development of our solar module technology by increasing the conversion efficiency of our modules by approximately 5 compared to 2010 from 113 to 119 

selling general and administrative 



the increase in selling general and administrative expense was primarily due to 348 million in estimated compensation payments to customers under certain circumstances for power lost prior to the remediation of the customers system under our voluntary remediation program discussed above in —20082009 manufacturing excursion” a 152 million increase in infrastructure spending partially related to the implementation of a new erp system 145 million increase in salaries and personnelrelated expenses including a 15 million increase in sharebased compensation expense a 105 million allowance for doubtful accounts concerning the collectability of past due accounts receivable for a certain customer an 86 million increase in expenses related to the development of systems projects and new markets and a 73 million increase in expenses related to professional fees facilities and other operating expenses 

we expensed 459 million totaltodate for compensation payments to customers for power lost prior to the remediation of the customer’s system under our voluntary remediation program discussed above in —20082009 manufacturing excursion” such amounts include 403 million of expense in 2011 and 318 million in expenses in the fourth quarter of 2011 reflecting our most recent best estimate 

  production startup 



during 2011  we incurred 336 million  of production startup expenses primarily due to manufacturing expansion activity in germany malaysia vietnam france and arizona including legal regulatory and personnel costs compared with 194 million  of production startup expenses for manufacturing expansion activity in malaysia france ohio and germany during 2010  production startup expenses are comprised of the cost of labor and material and depreciation expense to run and qualify the production lines related facility expenses management of our replication process and legal and regulatory costs 

goodwill impairment 



as of december 31 2010  the 3934 million  in goodwill related to our components reporting unit primarily represented goodwill originally allocated from the acquisitions of optisolar in 2009 and nextlight in 2010 the allocation of substantially all the goodwill from these acquisitions to our components reporting unit represented the expected synergies economies of scale and vertical integration our components business would realize from using our solar modules in the project pipelines obtained from these acquisitions the goodwill allocation to our components business was consistent with our historical view that the systems business functioned as an enabler for the components business to drive module throughput once goodwill has been assigned to a reporting unit for accounting purposes the goodwill is no longer associated with the underlying acquisitions that the goodwill originated from 

we determined the implied fair value of goodwill in the components reporting unit to be zero as of december 31 2011  as a result we impaired all of the goodwill in the components reporting unit and recorded 3934 million  of impairment expense 

see note 5 “goodwill and intangible assets”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2011  included in this annual report on form 10k 

restructuring 



during 2011 we incurred 604 million  of restructuring expenses due to charges relating to a series of initiatives to accelerate operating cost reductions and improve overall operating efficiency see note 4 “restructuring and acquisitions”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2011  included in this annual report on form 10k 

foreign currency gain loss   



foreign exchange gain increased during 2011  compared with 2010  primarily due to a decrease in our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities in 2011 

  

interest income 



interest income decreased during 2011  compared with 2010  primarily as a result of interest received from notes receivable and penalties for late customer payments during 2010 partially offset by interest received on longterm investments during 2011 

interest expense net 



interest expense net of amounts capitalized remained consistent during 2011  compared with 2010  as a result of substantially all interest expense being capitalized during both periods see note 8 “consolidated balance sheet details”  to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2011  included in this annual report on form 10k 

other income expense net 



other income net decreased during 2011  compared with 2010  primarily as a result of a realized gain associated with the sale of our equity investment in a related party in 2010 and changes in fair value of certain foreign exchange contracts in 2011 partially offset by realized gains on the sale of fixed income investments in 2011 

income tax benefit expense 



income tax benefit expense decreased by 1121 million  during 2011  compared with 2010  the reduction in income tax expense in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily attributable to the reduction in pretax profits during such periods and a greater percentage of profits earned in lower tax jurisdictions offset by an increase in tax expense related to the impairment of nondeductible goodwill see note 20 “income taxes”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

fiscal years ended december 31 2010  and december 26 2009   

  

net sales 



the increase in net sales was primarily driven by strong demand from german customers in advance of further fit reductions an increase in revenue from our systems business and an increase in production volume resulting in a 28 increase in megawatts sold during 2010 compared with 2009 these increases were partially offset by a decrease in our module asp the increase in megawatts sold was attributable to the full production ramp of our fourplant malaysian manufacturing center in 2009 full 

production ramp of our perrysburg ohio expansion in 2010 continued improvements to our manufacturing process and line throughput and growth in our systems business in addition we increased the average conversion efficiency of our modules by approximately 3 during 2010 compared with 2009 our module asp excluding the impact of systems segment breakeven reporting decreased by approximately 10 during 2010 compared with 2009 the decline in our module average selling price was attributable to the following a 5 decrease due to market price declines driven by fit reductions in europe a 5 decrease due to annual contractual agreements and a 2 decrease due to the weakening of the euro against the us dollar exchange rate partially offset by a 2 increase due to a shift in customer mix revenue recognized by our systems business during 2010 was 3784 million and resulted primarily from the sale of utilityscale solar power systems in europe and north america and from percentageofcompletion revenue recognition for utilityscale solar power systems in north america during 2010 and 2009 46 and 65 respectively of our net sales resulted from solar module sales to customers headquartered in germany

 the increase in cost of sales was due to higher sales volumes including an increase in the completion and sale of utilityscale solar power projects by our systems business the full production ramp of our first four plants at our malaysian manufacturing center in 2009 and the full production ramp of our perrysburg ohio expansion in 2010 the increased production and sales volumes in our components business and increased volume sold through our systems business had the following effects a 2254 million increase in direct material expense a 792 million increase in manufacturing overhead costs an 180 million increase in sales freight a 182 million increase in warranty expense and a 163 million net increase in other costs 

  

the 792 million increase in manufacturing overhead costs for 2010 was due to a 329 million increase in salaries and personnelrelated expenses including a 108 million increase in sharebased compensation expense a 170 million increase in depreciation and equipment expenses a 20 million increase in facility related expenses and a 273 million increase in incremental systems costs each of these manufacturing overhead cost increases primarily resulted from increased production capacity resulting from the full ramp of our malaysian manufacturing center expansion of our perrysburg ohio plant and ramp of our systems business 

  

the net increase in other costs for 2010 includes 237 million related to an increase in estimated expenses for certain module replacement efforts beyond normal warranty related to the manufacturing excursion described above under —20082009 manufacturing excursion accordingly we accrued additional expenses of 308 million in 2010 and 379 million in totaltodate to cover the replacement of the anticipated affected module population in the field such amounts include 85 million in expenses accrued during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010 reflecting updated best estimates of the total replacement costs based on our field data and execution to date of the module replacement program 

  

our average manufacturing cost per watt declined by 010 per watt or 11 from 087 in 2009 to 077 in 2010 and included 002 of noncash stock based compensation 

gross profit 



  

gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased by 44 percentage points in 2010 compared with 2009 this decrease was attributable to the following a 40 percentage point reduction due to a decline in our module asp a 39 percentage point reduction due to segment mix between our components and systems businesses a 11 percentage point reduction relating to the manufacturing excursion discussed above under “—20082009 manufacturing excursion” and a 06 percentage point reduction due to the weakening of the euro against the us dollar exchange rate partially offset by a 52 percentage point margin improvement attributable to continued manufacturing scale and reductions in our manufacturing cost per watt we expect that gross profit will be impacted in future periods by the volatility of the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro and product mix between our components and systems businesses 

research and development 



the increase in research and development expense was due to a 106 million increase in personnelrelated expenses including a 22 million increase in sharebased compensation expense resulting from increased headcount devoted to working on various projects to increase the efficiency of our modules at converting sunlight into electricity and a 96 million increase in depreciation testing and qualification material costs partially offset by a 36 million decrease in other expenses during 2010 we continued the development of solar modules with increased efficiencies at converting sunlight into electricity and increased the conversion efficiency of our modules by approximately 3 compared with 2009 

selling general and administrative 



the increase in selling general and administrative expense was due to a 27 million increase in salaries and personnelrelated expenses due to growth after giving effect to a 25 million decrease in sharebased compensation expense due to onetime charges associated with our executive management team in 2009 a 176 million increase in expenses related to our systems business a 148 million increase in facility and depreciation expenses a 63 million increase in professional fees and expenses associated with the implementation of a new erp system and a 74 million increase in other expenses selling general and administrative expense also included 53 million of other operating expenses related to impairment charges of certain project assets 

production startup 



during 2010 we incurred 194 million of production startup expenses for our eightline malaysian fourline german oneline perrysburg ohio and twoline blanquefort france manufacturing expansions including legal regulatory and personnel costs compared with 139 million of production startup expenses for our malaysian and perrysburg ohio manufacturing expansions during 2009 production startup expenses are composed of the cost of labor and material and depreciation expense to run and qualify the production lines related facility expenses management of our replication process and legal and regulatory costs 

foreign currency gain loss 



foreign exchange gain decreased during 2010 compared with 2009 due to an increase in our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and volatility of the us dollar relative to other currencies in particular the euro 

interest income 



interest income increased during 2010 compared with 2009 primarily as a result of an increase in the average interest bearing cash and investment balances year over year and interest earned from notes receivable 

interest expense net 



interest expense net of amounts capitalized decreased during 2010 compared with 2009 primarily as a result of higher amounts of interest expense capitalized during 2010 in addition interest expense net for 2009 included a 24 million expense related to the termination of the interest rate swaps for our german debt facility we fully repaid this facility on june 30 2009 

other income expense net 



other income during 2010 primarily resulted from a realized gain associated with the sale of our equity investment in a related party partially offset by other expenses other expense during 2009 primarily resulted from nonrecurring expenses associated with our credit default swaps 

income tax benefit expense 



income tax expense increased by 517 million during 2010 compared with 2009 of this increase 138 million related to a onetime noncash tax charge in connection with our decision to repatriate approximately 300 million of earnings from certain of our foreign subsidiaries prior to january 1 2011 when recently enacted us international tax legislation became effective in addition 115 million related to a onetime tax benefit recorded in 2009 in connection with the pullforward of the malaysian tax holiday from 2008 substantially all of the remainder of the increase related to a 758 million increase in pretax income and a greater percentage of profits earned in higher tax jurisdictions see note 20 “income taxes”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

business segment review 



our chief operating decision maker codm consisting of certain members of senior executive staff has viewed the manufacturing and sale of solar modules from the components segment as the core driver of our resource allocation profitability and cash throughput all sales or service offerings from our systems segment are for pv solar power systems that use our solar modules which are designed and manufactured by our components segment as a result we have viewed our systems segment 

as an enabler to drive module throughput our systems segment enables solar module throughput by developing state of the art construction techniques and process management to reduce the installed cost of our pv systems and accordingly this business was not intended to generate profits that are independent of the underlying solar modules sold with such systems segment service offerings therefore for the fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 our codm viewed the primary objective of our systems segment to be achieving breakeven results before income taxes we include all sales of our solar modules manufactured by our components segment and installed in projects sold by our systems segment in “net sales” of our components business see note 24 “segment and geographical information”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

components segment 



components segment net sales decreased by 5  during 2011  compared with 2010  primarily due to lower asp due to competitive pressure our module asp excluding the impact of systems segment breakeven reporting decreased by approximately 10 during 2011  compared with 2010  the decline in our module asp was attributable to a 15 decrease of our nonsystems module asp due to competitive pressures and geographic mix the decrease was partially offset by a 5 increase of our systems module asp driven primarily by the mix of systems projects recognized in revenue the effect of our segment reporting adjustments to achieve breakeven results before income taxes for our systems segment decreased the module average selling price by an additional 1 

  

components segment net sales increased by 11  during 2010  compared with 2009  primarily driven by price elasticity that resulted in strong demand for our solar modules as prices declined increased net sales attributable to modules installed in utilityscale solar power systems for which we have recognized revenue an increase in production volume as a result of bringing additional manufacturing lines into full production and continued improvements to our manufacturing process 

  

components segment cost of sales increased by 18  during 2011  compared with 2010  and by 16  during 2010  compared with 2009  primarily due to higher production and sales volumes in addition cost of sales increased in 2011 compared to 2010 due to increased expense from voluntary remediation efforts related to the manufacturing excursion costs discussed above under —20082009 manufacturing excursion 

components segment profit decreased by 107  during 2011  compared with 2010  primarily due to goodwill impairment lower average selling price and higher costs resulting from the manufacturing excursion and related remediation program discussed above under —20082009 manufacturing excursion” partially offset by an increase in the mw volume of solar modules sold components segment profit increased by 11  during 2010  compared with 2009  primarily due to an increase in the mw volume of solar modules sold reductions in our manufacturing cost per watt and by increased throughput partially offset by a decline in our module average selling price and certain manufacturing excursion and warranty related expenses 

  

systems segment 



systems segment net sales increased from 3784 million  during 2010  to 6983 million  during 2011  reflecting primarily the completion and sale of or percentageofcompletion revenue recognition for various utilityscale solar power systems in north america 

  

systems segment net sales increased from 1008 million  during 2009  to 3784 million  during 2010  reflecting primarily the sale of or percentageofcompletion recognition for various utilityscale solar power systems in north america and europe 

  

systems segment cost of sales increased from 3001 million  in 2010  to 5190 million  in 2011  and from 936 million  in 2009  to 3001 million  in 2010  primarily due to the increase in construction activities for various utilityscale solar power projects in north america during these periods 

systems segment profit was zero for 2011  2010  and 2009  as noted above we operate our systems segment with the objective to achieve breakeven results before income taxes see note 24 “segment and geographical information”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for more information 

product revenue 

  

the following table sets forth the total amounts of solar modules and solar power systems revenue recognized for the years ended december 31 2011  december 31 2010  and december 26 2009  for the purposes of the following table a “solar module revenue” is composed of total revenues from the sale of solar modules to third parties and b “solar power systems revenue” is composed of total revenues from the sale of complete solar power systems and related services including the solar modules installed in the solar power systems 



liquidity and capital resources 

we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents marketable securities cash flows from operating activities revolving credit facility and access to the capital markets will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months we intend to continue to carefully execute our long term strategic plan and manage credit and market risk however if our financial results or operating plans change from our current assumptions we may not have sufficient resources to support the execution of our long term strategic plan 

      cash generated from operations is our primary source of operating liquidity and we believe that internally generated cash flows combined with our existing cash and cash equivalents marketable securities and availability under our revolving credit facility are sufficient to support daytoday business operations our treasury department monitors the efficiency of our balance sheet to ensure we have adequate liquidity both domestically and internationally to support the execution of our long term strategic plan 

       as of december 31 2011  we had 7880 million  in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities compared with 11138 million  as of december 31 2010  as of december 31 2011  and december 31 2010  6389 million  and 6840 million  respectively of our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in euros and us dollardenominated holdings we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed 

we intend to maintain appropriate debt levels based upon cash flow expectations the overall cost of capital and cash requirements for operations capital expenditures and discretionary strategic spending we believe that when necessary we will have adequate access to capital markets although our ability to raise capital on terms commercially acceptable to us could be constrained if there is insufficient investor interest due to industrywide or companyspecific concerns we have an active shelf registration statement filed with the sec for the issuance of debt or equity securities if needed 

our expanding systems business required increased liquidity in 2011 and is expected to continue to have significant liquidity requirements in the future solar power project development cycles which span the time between the identification of a site location to the commercial operation of a pv power plant vary substantially and can take many years to mature as a result of these long project cycles we may need to make significant upfront investments of resources in advance of the receipt of any cash flows from the sale of or payments for such systems projects these amounts include payment of interconnection and other deposits some of which are nonrefundable posting of letters of credit and incurring engineering permitting legal and other expenses additionally we may have to use our working capital or the availability under our revolving credit facility to finance the construction of our systems projects if such projects cannot be sold before construction begins depending upon the size and 

number of projects that we are developing and selffinancing the construction of the systems business may require significant liquidity for example we may have to substantially complete the construction of a systems project before such project is sold we have historically financed these upfront investments for project development and when necessary construction primarily using working capital 

in the future we may also engage in one or more debt or equity financings such financings could result in increased expenses or dilution to our existing stockholders if we are unable to obtain debt or equity financing on reasonable terms we may be unable to execute our long term strategic plan 

the following significant developments in 2011 have impacted or are expected to impact our liquidity

to terminated employees and other costs that could substantially reduce our liquidity position to the point where we need to pursue additional sources of financing assuming such sources are available to us   

 

the unprecedented disruption in the credit markets that began in 2008 and the current instability in the euro zone have had a significant adverse impact on a number of financial institutions the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in europe and its impact on the balance sheets and lending practices of european banks in particular could negatively impact our access to and cost of capital and therefore could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and competitive position it could also similarly affect our customers and therefore limit the sales of our modules and demand for our systems business as well as of december 31 2011  our liquidity and investments have not been materially adversely impacted by the current credit environment and we believe that they will not be materially adversely impacted in the near future we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity and the credit markets however we cannot predict with any certainty the impact to us of any further disruption in the credit environment 

cash flows 

the following table summarizes the key cash flow metrics for the years ended december 31 2011  december 31 2010  and december 26 2009  in thousands 



operating activities 

cash used by operating activities was 335 million  during 2011  compared with cash provided by operating activities of 7055 million  during 2010  and 6752 million during 2009 the decrease in operating cash flows during 2011  was primarily due to the difference between net cash received from customers and net cash paid to suppliers being significantly less than in 2010 and 2009 this disparity was primarily the result of an increase in accounts receivable unbilled which represents revenue that has been recognized in advance of billing the customer this is common for construction contracts although such construction work did not result in cash received from customers the underlying cost of construction activities resulted in cash paid to suppliers creating a timing difference for cash flows from operating activities accounts receivable unbilled as of december 31 2011 is expected to be billed and collected within the next 12 months another significant driver of the decrease was the increase from 2010 in inventories and bos parts which resulted in an increase in cash paid to suppliers but as such inventories and bos parts were not yet sold there was no corresponding cash received from customers the remaining decrease in cash provided by operating activities was the result of net differences in excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation arrangements income taxes paid interest received and interest paid in 2011 compared to 2010 and 2009 

  investing activities 

cash used in investing activities was 6765 million  during 2011  compared with 7421 million  during 2010  and 7017 million during 2009 the decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily the result of less acquisition activity in 2011 compared to 2010 and a larger net inflow from sales maturities and purchases of marketable securities in 2011 than in 2010 and 2009 those increases were primarily offset by more capital expenditures during 2011 compared to 2010 and 2009 due to completion of two new plants in malaysia completion of expansions in frankfurtoder germany and perrysburg ohio and construction of new plants in vietnam and mesa arizona 

during 2011 we made significant capital expenditures related to the construction of manufacturing plants in vietnam and mesa arizona including expenditures for machinery and equipment for eight manufacturing lines the balancing of our production capabilities with market demand is a core component of our manufacturing capacity expansion strategy and our long term strategic 

plan as discussed above we will not construct our previously announced 4line plant in vietnam and have indefinitely postponed the commissioning of our previously announced 4line plant in mesa arizona and the construction of our previously announced 2line plant in france until global supply and demand dynamics support the additional manufacturing capacity although the timing for production from these plants is uncertain we expect to continue to make any necessary capital expenditures for these capacity expansions during 2012 to continue construction and to acquire the underlying machinery and equipment 

financing activities 

cash provided by financing activities was 5712 million  during 2011 compared with cash provided by financing activities of 1505 million  during 2010 and cash used in financing of 220 million during 2009 

cash provided by financing activities resulted primarily from proceeds of 3701 million  from borrowings on our malaysian ringgit facility agreement german facility agreement and malaysian euro facility along with 1000 million of net proceeds from drawdowns on our revolving credit facility additionally we recorded excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation arrangements of 1108 million  and received cash from employee stock option exercises of 83 million  we used 338 million  of cash for the repayment of longterm debt 

  

cash provided by financing activities during 2010 resulted primarily from proceeds received from draw downs on our revolving credit facility of 1000 million excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation arrangements of 694 million as described below and by cash received from employee stock option exercises of 94 million partially offset by the repayment of longterm debt of 279 million 

  

during the year ended december 31 2010 we realized 694 million of excess tax benefits related to sharebased compensation arrangements from the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards comprised of excess tax deductions primarily as a result of our decision to repatriate approximately 300 million of earnings from certain of our foreign subsidiaries 

  

cash used in financing activities during 2009 resulted primarily from the repayment of longterm debt of 782 million partially offset by draw downs on our prior malaysian facility agreement net of issuance costs of 447 million related to the equipment export financing agreement for our malaysian manufacturing center proceeds from the issuance of employee stock options during 2009 were 60 million excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation arrangements during 2009 were 49 million 

contractual obligations 

the following table presents our contractual obligations as of december 31 2011  which consists of legal commitments requiring us to make fixed or determinable cash payments we purchase raw materials for inventory services and manufacturing equipment from a variety of vendors we also enter into construction contracts for the construction of new or expansion of existing manufacturing plants during the normal course of business in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help assure adequate supply we enter into agreements with suppliers that either allow us to procure goods and services when we choose or that establish purchase requirements 



 61 

 

 

in addition to the amounts shown in the table above we have recorded 829 million  of unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with asc 740 income taxes  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 

debt and credit sources 

as of december 31 2011  we had 6675 million  in outstanding longterm debt excluding amounts related to capital leases and 1967 million in outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees our longterm debt consisted of the following at december 31 2011  and december 31 2010  in thousands 



at december 31 2011  future principal payments on our longterm debt were due as follows in thousands 



the available capacity under our longterm debt facilities was primarily related to our revolving credit facility  which had 2513 million  in available capacity at december 31 2011  we believe that when necessary we will have adequate access to capital markets but there may be circumstances in the future related to macroeconomic conditions or factors specific to us that could limit or increase the cost of capital from such markets we have an active shelf registration statement filed with the sec for the issuance of debt or equity securities 

       we were in compliance with all debt covenants at december 31 2011  and expect to remain in compliance with these covenants for at least the next twelve months 

       see note 15 “debt”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further information about our longterm debt facilities 

capital expenditures 

we expect to spend up to 425 million for capital expenditures during 2012 including expenditures for machinery and equipment which we believe will increase our solar module efficiencies and the necessary expenditures to continue certain construction activities and to acquire the underlying machinery and equipment for our manufacturing plants in vietnam and mesa arizona a majority of our capital expenditures for 2012 will be incurred in foreign currencies and are therefore subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2011  

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 3 “recent accounting pronouncements”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for a summary of recent accounting pronouncements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our primary foreign currency exposures are cash flow exposure transaction exposure and earnings translation exposure 

cash flow exposure  we expect our subsidiaries to have material future cash flows including revenues and expenses that will be denominated in currencies other than the components functional currency our primary cash flow exposures are cash received from customers and cash paid to suppliers and associates changes in the exchange rates between our components’ functional currencies and the other currencies in which they transact will cause fluctuations in the cash flows we expect to receive or pay when these cash flows are realized or settled accordingly we enter into foreign exchange forward or crosscurrency swap contracts to hedge the value of a portion of these forecasted cash flows these foreign exchange forward and crosscurrency swap contracts qualified as cash flow hedges in accordance with asc 815 derivatives and hedging  and we designated them as such we initially report the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss in “accumulated other comprehensive income loss” and subsequently reclassify amounts into earnings when the underlying hedged transaction is settled 

most of our german plant’s operating expenses are denominated in euros creating natural hedges against the currency risk in our net sales during the first half of 2011  we purchased foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of the exchange risk on forecasted cash flows denominated in euros 

our operations in malaysia pay a portion of their operating expenses such as associate wages and utilities in malaysian ringgit exposing us to foreign currency exchange risk for those expenses 

for additional details on our hedging instruments and activities refer to note 9 “derivative financial instruments”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

our international operations accounted for 55  87  and 93  of our net sales during the years ended december 31 2011  december 31 2010  and december 26 2009  respectively of which 78  84  and 92  of these international sales respectively were denominated in euros as a result we have exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to our net sales fluctuations in exchange rates particularly in the us dollar to euro exchange rate and us dollar to malaysian ringgit affect our gross and net profit margins and could result in foreign exchange and operating losses in the past most of our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk has related to currency gains and losses between the time we sign and settle our sales contracts denominated in euros for example our supply contracts obligate us to deliver solar modules at a fixed price in euros per watt and do not adjust for fluctuations in the us dollar to euro exchange rate for the years ended december 31 2011  december 31 2010  and december 26 2009  a 10 change in the euro exchange rates would have impacted our net euro sales by 1237 million  1846 million  and 1777 million  respectively excluding the effect of our hedging activities our net sales denominated in euros are expected to continue to decline and therefore our foreign currency exchange risk associated with the euro is expected to also decline 

transaction exposure many components of our business have assets and liabilities primarily receivables investments accounts payable debt and solar module collection and recycling liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the component’s functional currency changes in the exchange rates between our components functional currencies and the other currencies in which these assets and liabilities are denominated can create fluctuations in our reported consolidated financial 

position results of operations and cash flows we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other derivative instruments to economically hedge assets and liabilities against the shortterm effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations the gains and losses on these derivative instruments will offset all or part of the transaction gains and losses that we recognize in earnings on the related foreign currency assets and liabilities these contracts typically have maturities of less than three months  

for additional details on our economic hedging instruments and activities refer to note 9 “derivative financial instruments”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

if the us dollar would have weakened by 10 against the euro malaysian ringgit japanese yen canadian dollar and australian dollar the impact on our income before income taxes during the year ended december 31 2011  would have been 05 million  favorable if the us dollar would have weakened by 10 against the euro malaysian ringgit japanese yen and canadian dollar the impact on our income before income taxes during the years ended december 31 2010  and december 26 2009  would have been 66 million  unfavorable and 05 million  favorable respectively 

earnings translation exposure  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to translate the financial statements of our subsidiaries that do not have a us dollar functional currency we may decide to purchase forward exchange contracts or other instruments to offset this impact from currency fluctuations these contracts would be markedtomarket on a monthly basis and any unrealized gain or loss would be recorded in earnings we do not hedge translation exposure at this time but may do so in the future 

in the past currency exchange rate fluctuations have had an impact on our business and results of operations for example currency exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted our cash flows by 214 million  127 million  and 32 million  in the years ended december 31 2011  december 31 2010  and december 26 2009  respectively although we cannot predict the impact of future currency exchange rate fluctuations on our business or results of operations we believe that we will continue to have risk associated with currency exchange rate fluctuations in the future we will continue to evaluate actions we can take to use derivatives to help mitigate this risk 

interest rate risk 

our primary interest rate risks are our outstanding variable rate debt our solar power system sales prices from the effect of interest rates on our customer’s financing of such solar power systems and our investments in debt securities 

variable rate debt exposure we are exposed to interest rate risk because our revolving credit facility german facility agreement malaysian ringgit facility agreement malaysian euro facility agreement and the floating rate portion of our malaysian facility agreement have variable interest rates exposing us to variability in interest expense and cash flows we use interest rate swap contracts and crosscurrency swap contracts to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated with a portion of our variable rate debt instruments we have interest rate swap contracts in place to mitigate the interest rate risk for a portion our german facility agreement and the floating rate portion of our malaysian facility agreement we also have a crosscurrency swap contract in place to mitigate the interest rate risk of our malaysian ringgit facility agreement 

for additional details on our hedging instruments and activities refer to note 9 “derivative financial instruments”  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

 an increase in the euro interbank offered rate euribor would impact our cost of borrowing under the unhedged portion of our german facility agreement  and our entire malaysian euro facility agreement  and an increase in the london interbank offered rate libor would impact our cost of borrowing under our revolving credit facility  if euribor increased or decreased by 100 basis points our interest cost for the year ended december 31 2011 would have increased or decreased 06 million respectively if libor increased or decreased by 100 basis points our interest cost for the year ended december 31 2011 would have increased or decreased 10 million respectively 

effect on customers financing of solar power systems  we are exposed to interest rate risk because many of our systems business customers depend on debt and equity financing to purchase a solar power system from us although the useful life of a solar power system is considered to be approximately 25 years endusers of our solar power systems must pay the entire cost of the solar power system by the time such system is completed as a result many of our customers rely on debt financing to fund their upfront capital expenditures an increase in interest rates could make it difficult for our endusers to secure the financing necessary to purchase a system this could lower demand or the price we can charge for our solar power systems and reduce our net sales in addition we believe that a significant percentage of our endusers install solar power systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt an increase in interest rates could lower an investor’s return on investment in a system or make alternative investments more attractive relative to solar power systems which in each 

case could cause these endusers to seek alternative investments that promise higher returns 

investments in debt securities exposure  we invest in debt securities which exposes us to interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and provide liquidity on demand while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the market value of the investment to fluctuate for example if we hold a security that was issued with an interest rate fixed at the thenprevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises the market value of our investment may decline 

as of december 31 2011  our marketable securities earned a pretax yield of 048  with a weighted average maturity of 11 months  if interest rates were to instantaneously increase decrease by 100 basis points the market value of our total investment portfolio could decrease increase by 19 million  the direct risk to us associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and we do not believe that a 10 change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows as of december 31 2011  all of our marketable securities were in commercial paper corporate debt securities federal and foreign agency debt foreign government obligations supranational debt and us government obligations  

as of december 31 2011  our restricted investments earned a pretax yield of 585  with a weighted average maturity of approximately 20  years if interest rates were to instantaneously increase decrease by 100 basis points the market value of our total restricted investment portfolio could decrease increase by 347 million  the direct risk to us associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our restricted investment portfolio given that our restricted investment portfolio is intended to prefund our estimated solar module collection and recycling costs and given the expected holding period of these investments we believe it is unlikely that a 10 change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows as of december 31 2011  all of our restricted investments were in foreign and us government obligations

we are exposed to price risks for the raw materials components and energy costs used in the manufacture and transportation of our solar modules and bos parts used in solar power systems also some of our raw materials and components are sourced from a limited number of suppliers or a single supplier we endeavor to qualify multiple suppliers using a robust qualification process in some cases we also enter into longterm supply contracts for raw materials and components as a result we remain exposed to price changes in the raw materials and components used in our solar modules in addition a failure by a key supplier could disrupt our supply chain which could result in higher prices andor a disruption in our manufacturing process we may be unable to pass along changes in the cost of the raw materials and components for our products and systems to our customers and may be in default of our delivery obligations if we experience a manufacturing disruption 

credit risk 

we have certain financial and derivative instruments that subject us to credit risk these consist primarily of cash cash equivalents marketable securities restricted investments trade accounts receivable interest rate swap contracts crosscurrency swap contracts and foreign exchange forward contracts we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial and derivative instruments we place cash cash equivalents marketable securities restricted investments interest rate swap contracts crosscurrency contracts and foreign exchange forward contracts with various highquality financial institutions and limit the amount of credit risk from any one counterparty we continuously evaluate the credit standing of our counterparty financial institutions 

in addition we have certain investments in debt securities related to countries in the eurozone these investments are for debt securities of countries with a lower likelihood of experiencing significant economic fiscal andor political strains such that default or severe decreases in fair value would occur however such risk cannot be eliminated and is reflected in the current fair value of the investments as of december 31 2011

 item 9a controls and procedures 

a evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain “disclosure controls and procedures” as such term is defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are 

met additionally in designing disclosure controls and procedures our management was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures the design of any disclosure control and procedure also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 

based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level 

b management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate “internal control over financial reporting” as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011  based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework  issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 

based on the results of our evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2011  

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011  has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in its report which appears herein 

c changes in internal control over financial reporting 

we completed phase ii of our enterprise resource planning erp system implementation during 2011 for a discussion of risks relating to the implementation of a new erp system please see the risk factor entitled “ implementing a new enterprise resource planning system could interfere with our business or operations and could adversely impact our financial position results of operations and cash flows ” in item 1a “risk factors” in this annual report on form 10k the implementation of our erp system represents a change in our internal control over financial reporting 

  

there have been no material changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter ended december 31 2011  covered by this annual report on form 10k that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

d inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within our company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

 item 1 business 

  

overview 

  

we manufacture and sell solar modules with an advanced thinfilm semiconductor technology and we design construct and sell photovoltaic pv solar power systems 

  

in addressing a growing global demand for pv solar electricity we target markets with varying approaches depending on the underlying economics market requirements and distribution channels in subsidized feedin tariff fit markets such as germany we have historically sold most of our solar modules to solar project developers system integrators and independent power producers in other markets such as the united states the demand for solar electricity has been primarily driven by renewable portfolio standards requiring regulated utilities to supply a portion of their total electricity from renewable energy sources such as solar power to meet the needs of these markets and enable balanceofsystem bos cost reductions we have developed a fully integrated systems business that can provide turnkey utilityscale pv system solutions for system owners and low cost solar electricity to utility endusers our fully integrated systems business has enabled us to increase module throughput drive cost reduction across the value chain identify and break constraints to sustainable markets and deliver the most compelling solutions to our customers and endusers with our fully integrated systems business we believe we are in a position to continue to expand our business in transition markets and eventually economically sustainable markets in which subsidies or incentives are minimal which are expected to develop in areas with abundant solar resources and sizable electricity demand we are committed to continually lowering the cost of solar electricity and in the long term we plan on competing on an economic basis with conventional fossilfuelbased peaking power generation 

  

in furtherance of our goal of delivering the lowest cost of solar electricity and achieving price parity with conventional fossilfuelbased peak electricity generation we are continually focused on reducing pv solar system costs in four primary areas module manufacturing bos costs consisting of the costs of the components of a solar power system other than the solar modules such as inverters mounting hardware grid interconnection equipment wiring and other devices and installation labor costs project development costs and the cost of capital first with respect to our module manufacturing costs our advanced technology has allowed us to reduce our average module manufacturing costs to the lowest in the world based on publicly available information in 2010  our total average manufacturing costs were 077 per watt which we believe is significantly less than those of traditional crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers by continuing to improve conversion efficiency and production line throughput lower material costs and drive volume scale to further decrease overhead costs we believe that we can further reduce our manufacturing costs per watt and maintain our cost advantage over traditional crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers second by continuing to improve conversion efficiency leverage volume procurement around standardized hardware platforms and accelerate installation time we believe we can continue to make reductions in bos costs which represent over half of all of the costs associated with a typical utilityscale pv solar power system third with respect to project development costs we seek optimal site locations in an effort to minimize transmission and permitting costs and to accelerate lead time to 

  

electricity generation finally we believe that continuing to strengthen our financial position including our balance sheet and credit profile together with increasing our solar power system operating experience will enable us to continue to lower the cost of capital associated with our solar power systems thereby further enhancing the economic viability of our projects and lowering the cost of electricity generated by solar power systems that incorporate our modules and technology 

  

we are one of the worlds largest pv solar module manufacturers and produced nearly 14 gigawatts gw of solar modules in 2010  we are the worlds largest thinfilm pv solar module manufacturer we manufacture our solar modules on highthroughput production lines and perform all manufacturing steps ourselves in an automated proprietary and continuous process our solar modules employ a thin layer of semiconductor material to convert sunlight into electricity our manufacturing process eliminates the multiple supply chain operators and expensive and time consuming batch processing steps that are used to produce a crystalline silicon solar module currently we manufacture our solar modules at our perrysburg ohio frankfurtoder germany and kulim malaysia manufacturing facilities with additional manufacturing facilities under construction or planned for construction in kulim malaysia frankfurtoder germany blanquefort france vietnam and the united states and we conduct our research and development activities primarily at our perrysburg ohio manufacturing facility 

  

our fully integrated solar power systems business includes i project development ii engineering procurement and construction epc services iii operating and maintenance om services and iv project finance expertise all as described in more detail below 

  

   

   

   

   

we believe that combining our reliable low cost module manufacturing capability coupled with our systems business enables us to more rapidly reduce the price of solar electricity accelerate the adoption of our technology in largescale systems identify and break constraints to the successful migration to sustainable solar markets and further our mission to create enduring value by enabling a world powered by clean affordable solar electricity 

  

segment information 

  

  we operate our business in two segments our components segment is our principal business and involves the design manufacture and sale of solar modules which convert sunlight into electricity customers of our components segment include project developers system integrators and operators of renewable energy projects 

  

  

our other segment is our fully integrated systems business through which we provide a complete pv solar power system which includes project development epc services om services when applicable and project finance when required our systems segment sells solar power systems all of which use our solar modules directly to investor owned utilities independent power developers and producers commercial and industrial companies and other system owners who purchase completed solar power plants epc services andor om services from us 

  

our chief operating decision maker codm consisting of our senior executive staff views the sale of solar modules from the components segment as the core driver of our profitability return on net assets and cash throughput and as a result we view our systems segment as an enabler to drive module throughput our epc business is intended to enable sales throughput by developing state of the art construction techniques and process management to reduce the installed cost of our pv systems and accordingly this business is not intended to generate a standalone construction profit margin therefore we operate our systems segment with the objective to achieve breakeven results before income taxes in our operating segment financial disclosures we include the sale of our solar modules manufactured by our components segment and installed in projects sold by our systems segment in “net sales” of our components business see note 23 segment and geographical information to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

  

components business 

  

our components segment which is our principal business involves the design manufacture and sale of solar modules which convert sunlight into electricity 

  

  solar modules 

  

each solar module is a glass laminate approximately 2ft x 4ft 60cm x 120cm in size that encapsulates a cadmium telluride thinfilm semiconductor our solar modules had an average rated power of approximately 76 watts 75 watts and 73 watts for 2010  2009  and 2008  respectively our thinfilm technology also has relatively high energy performance in low light and high temperature environments compared with traditional crystalline silicon solar modules our semiconductor structure is a singlejunction polycrystalline thinfilm that uses cadmium telluride as the absorption layer and cadmium sulfide as the window layer cadmium telluride has absorption properties that are highly matched to the solar spectrum and can deliver competitive conversion efficiencies using only about 12 of the semiconductor material used by traditional crystalline silicon solar modules 

  

  manufacturing process 

  

we have integrated our manufacturing processes into a continuous production line with the following three stages the “deposition” stage the “cell definition” stage and the “assembly and test” stage in the deposition stage panels of treated glass are robotically loaded onto the production line where they are cleaned heated and coated with a layer of cadmium sulfide followed by a layer of cadmium telluride using our proprietary vapor transport deposition technology after which the semiconductorcoated plates are cooled rapidly to increase strength in our cell definition stage we use high speed lasers to transform the large single semiconductor coating on the glass plate into a series of interconnected cells that deliver the desired current and voltage output our proprietary laser scribing technology is capable of accomplishing accurate and complex scribes at high speeds finally in the assembly and test stage we apply busbars interlaminate material and a rear glass cover sheet that is laminated to encapsulate the semiconductor a junction box and termination wires are then applied to complete the assembly each solar module is then tested for current leakage and measured on a solar simulator the final assembly stage is the only stage in our production line that requires manual processing 

  

our manufacturing facilities in perrysburg ohio frankfurtoder germany and kulim malaysia have each received an iso 9001 quality system certification an iso 140012004 environmental system certification and the occupational health and safety standards ohsas 18001 certification an international occupational health and safety management system specification we anticipate that our additional manufacturing facilities under construction or planned for construction in kulim malaysia frankfurtoder germany blanquefort france vietnam and the united states will also obtain these certifications within 24 months of production startup 

  

research development and engineering 

  

we continue to devote a substantial amount of resources to research and development with the primary objective of lowering the cost of electricity generated by pv systems using our solar modules within our components business we focus our research and development activities on among other areas continuing to increase the conversion efficiency of our solar modules and improving manufacturing efficiencies including volume ramp throughput improvement and material cost reduction we believe the most promising ways of increasing the conversion efficiency of our solar modules include maximizing the number of photons 

  

that reach the absorption layer of the semiconductor material to facilitate conversion into electrons maximizing the number of electrons that reach the surface of the semiconductor and minimizing the electrical losses between the semiconductor layer and the back metal conductor 

  

in the course of our research and development activities we continuously explore and research new technologies in our efforts to sustain competitive differentiation in our modules we typically qualify process and product improvements for full production at our ohio plant and then use our “copy smart” process to propagate them to our other production lines we believe that this systematic approach to research and development will provide continuous improvements and ensure uniform adoption across our production lines in addition our production lines are replicas of each other using our “copy smart” process and as a result a process or production improvement on one line can be rapidly deployed to other production lines 

  

  customers 

  

with respect to our components business during 2010  we sold most of our solar modules to solar project developers system integrators and operators headquartered in germany italy france spain and the united states our customers typically develop construct own and operate solar power plants or sell turnkey solar power plants to endusers that include owners of land owners of agricultural buildings owners of commercial warehouses offices and industrial buildings public agencies municipal government authorities utility companies and financial investors who desire to own largescale solar power plant projects we continually seek to geographically diversify our customer base and are investing in market development particularly in areas with abundant solar resources and sizable electricity demand including other parts of europe china india australia and the middle east 

  

as of december 31 2010  we had supply contracts for the sale of solar modules with fourteen principal customers supply contracts headquartered throughout the european union these contracts account for a significant portion of our planned module production over the period from 2011 through 2012 and therefore will significantly affect our overall financial performance in the past we have amended pricing and other terms in our supply contracts on a prospective basis in order to remain competitive as described below and we may decide in the future to further amend such contracts in order to address the highly competitive environment for solar modules in addition we enter into module sales agreements or standard purchase orders with customers for specific projects 

  

during 2009 we amended our supply contracts with certain of our customers to implement a program which provided a price rebate to these customers for solar modules purchased from us the intent of this program was to enable our customers to successfully compete in our core german market and to adjust for eligible customers the sales price which was documented in framework agreements entered into several years ago in light of market conditions the rebate program is offered for a defined period during which customers may apply and claim such rebate the most recent rebate offering for all solar modules sold through november 30 2010 will terminate on february 28 2011 beginning march 1 2011 we will offer customers a slightly modified rebate program for solar modules sold on or after december 1 2010 including applicability to certain european geographic areas in addition to germany the rebate amounts continue to be established so as to enable the sellthrough of our products at competitive prices the amount of rebate earned during a fiscal quarter is based on i the volume of solar modules shipped to a customer measured in watts ii the volume of solar modules registered for eligible projects measured in watts provided that those solar modules were invoiced by the buyer to an enduser and iii the rebate rate the rebate program applies a specified rebate rate to solar modules sold for solar power projects in certain geographic areas customers need to meet certain requirements in order to be eligible for and benefit from this program as of december 31 2010  we have experienced approximately 81 participation in this program by eligible customers 

  

during 2010  the principal customers of our components business were edf en development  juwi solar gmbh  and phoenix solar ag  during 2010  each of these three customers individually accounted for between 10 and 20 of our components segment’s net sales all of our other customers individually accounted for less than 10 of our net sales during 2010  the loss of any of our major customers could have an adverse effect on our business as we expand our manufacturing capacity we are seeking to develop additional customer relationships in other markets and regions which would reduce our customer and geographic concentration and dependence 

  

while our supply contracts have certain firm purchase commitments these contracts are subject to amendments made by us or requested by our customers such as the above mentioned amendments entered into since 2009 these amendments decreased the expected revenue under our supply contracts during 2009 and 2010 in addition our supply contracts are substantially denominated in euros and therefore are subject to exchange rate fluctuations between the euro and us dollar 

  

as of december 31 2010  the supply contracts in the aggregate allowed for approximately 24 billion  €21 billion denominated in euro at an assumed exchange rate of 115 €100 in sales from 2011 to 2012  as of december 26 2009  the supply 

  

contracts in the aggregate allowed for approximately 40 billion  €33 billion denominated in euro at an assumed exchange rate of 115 €100 and 02 billion denominated in usd in sales from 2010 to 2013  the abovereferenced dollar amounts relating to the supply contracts decreased from 2009 to 2010  primarily due to revenue recognized for contracted volumes sold in 2010 module pricing adjustments the impact of the rebate program implemented in 2009 as described above preset price reductions under the terms of the supply contracts and the termination of a fiveyear agreement through 2013 with a solar power system project developer and system integrator in the united states which was a related party 

  

we anticipate that approximately 36 of the aggregate contracted revenue under the supply contracts as of december 31 2010 will not be fulfilled in 2011 because it is associated with deliveries to be made in 2012 we believe that the aggregate dollar amount associated with the supply contracts at any particular date is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future revenue for any particular period because the fulfillment of such amount is subject to a variety of factors including the factors described above 

  

competition 

  

the renewable energy solar energy and solar module sectors are highly competitive and continually evolving as participants strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete within the larger electric power industry we face continued competition which may result in price reductions reduced margins or loss of market share with respect to our components business we believe that our main sources of competition are crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers silicon and nonsilicon based thinfilm module manufacturers and companies developing solar thermal and concentrated pv technologies among pv module and cell manufacturers the principal methods of competition are price per watt production capacity conversion efficiency reliability warranty terms and finance ability at december 31 2010  the global pv industry consisted of more than 150 manufacturers of solar cells and modules 

  

in addition we expect to compete with future entrants to the pv industry that offer new technological solutions we may also face competition from semiconductor manufacturers and semiconductor equipment manufacturers or their customers several of which have already announced their intention to start production of pv cells solar modules or turnkey production lines some of these competitors may be part of larger corporations and have greater financial resources and greater brand name recognition than we do and as a result may be better positioned to adapt to changes in the industry or the economy as a whole 

  

we also face competition from companies that currently offer or are developing other renewable energy technologies including wind hydropower geothermal biomass and tidal technologies and other power generation sources that burn conventional fossil fuels 

  

raw materials 

  

our manufacturing process uses approximately 30 types of raw materials and components to construct a complete solar module one critical raw material in our production process is cadmium telluride of the other raw materials and components the following eight are also critical to our manufacturing process front glass coated with transparent conductive oxide cadmium sulfide photo resist laminate material tempered back glass cord platecord plate cap lead wire and solar connectors before we use these materials and components in our manufacturing process a supplier must undergo a rigorous qualification process we continually evaluate new suppliers and currently are qualifying several new suppliers and materials a few of our critical materials or components are single sourced and most others are supplied by a limited number of suppliers we are exploring a variety of tellurium mineral claims in various locations and expect to develop some of these tellurium resources in the future 

  

collection and recycling program 

  

consistent with the environmental philosophy of extended producer responsibility we have established the solar industrys first comprehensive prefunded module collection and recycling program the program is designed to maximize the recovery of valuable materials for use in new modules or other new products and minimize the environmental impacts associated with our modules at the end of their useful life approximately 90 of each collected first solar module is recycled into materials for use in new products including new solar modules endusers can request collection and recycling of their solar modules by us at any time at no cost we prefund the estimated collection and recycling cost at the time of sale assuming for this purpose a minimum service life of approximately 25 years for our solar modules in addition to achieving substantial environmental benefits our solar module collection and recycling program may provide us the opportunity to resell or redistribute working modules or recover certain raw materials and components for reuse in our manufacturing process we currently have recycling facilities operating at each manufacturing facility for manufacturing scrap warranty returns and modules collected at the end of their useful life that produce glass suitable for use in the production of new glass products and unrefined semiconductor materials that will be further processed by a third party supplier and then used to produce semiconductor materials for use in our solar modules 

  

  

to ensure that the prefunded amounts are available regardless of our financial status in the future a trust structure has been established funds are put into custodial accounts in the name of a trustee only the trustee can distribute funds from the custodial accounts and these funds cannot be accessed for any purpose other than for administering module collection and recycling either by us or a third party executing the collection and recycling services to provide further assurance that sufficient funds will be available our module collection and recycling program including the financing arrangement is audited periodically by an independent third party auditor 

  

  solar module warranty 

  

we provide a limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for five years following delivery to the owners of our solar modules we also warrant to the owners of our solar modules that solar modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 90 of their power output rating during the first 10 years following their installation and at least 80 of their power output rating during the following 15 years in resolving claims under both the defects and power output warranties we have the option of either repairing or replacing the covered solar module or under the power output warranty providing additional solar modules to remedy the power shortfall our warranties are automatically transferred from the original purchasers of our solar modules to subsequent purchasers as of december 31 2010  our components business accrued warranty liability was 265 million  of which 98 million was classified as current and 167 million was classified as noncurrent as of december 26 2009  our components business accrued warranty liability was 219 million  of which 76 million was classified as current and 144 million was classified as noncurrent 

  

systems business 

  

through our fully integrated systems business we provide a complete solar power system solution using our solar modules which may include project development epc services om services when applicable and project finance when required 

  

our systems business has grown over the past several years through a combination of business acquisitions and organic growth on november 30 2007 we completed the acquisition of turner renewable energy llc a privately held company which provided epc services for commercial solar power projects in the united states on april 3 2009 we completed the acquisition of the project development business of optisolar inc which included a multigigawatt project pipeline in january 2010 we completed the acquisition of certain assets from edison mission groups solar project development pipeline consisting of utilityscale solar projects located primarily on private land in california and the southwestern united states in july 2010 we completed the acquisition of nextlight renewable power llc a leading developer of utilityscale solar projects in the southwestern united states this transaction expanded our pipeline of solar power projects in the southwestern united states and supports our expansion in the us utilityscale power market 

  

project development 

  

our systems business is dependent upon successful completion of project development activities including site selection and acquisition obtaining in a timely manner the requisite interconnection and transmission studies obtaining environmental and land use permits maintaining effective site control and entering into a power purchase agreement with an offtaker of the power to be generated by the project these activities culminate in receiving the right to construct and operate a solar power system power purchase agreements define the price and terms the utility customer will pay for power produced from a project entering into a power purchase agreement generally provides the underlying economics needed to advance the construction finance and eventual sale of the project to the longterm site owner and power producer subject to obtaining all necessary permits depending primarily on the location and other site attributes the development cycle can range from one to five years or longer in some circumstances we may be required to spend significant sums for preliminary engineering permitting legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built if there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals we may be forced to incur additional costs andor the right of the offtaker under the power purchase agreement to terminate may be triggered 

  

our project development activities are currently focused on markets in north america europe and asia 

  

in north america we have as of february 24 2011 a nearly 24 gw ac contracted pipeline of projects that we expect to develop we are also developing other projects in north america that do not yet have power purchase agreements in 2010 we sold and constructed 138 mw ac in projects in north america see item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operationsfinancial operations overviewnet salessystems business” for a listing of these projects 

  

in europe we are engaged in project development activities with respect to certain projects in france and italy and we are 

  

actively evaluating additional project opportunities in europe 

  

in asia our project development activities include our initiatives in china in 2009 we entered into a memorandum of understanding and a cooperation framework agreement with the ordos china city government outlining a longterm strategic relationship between the parties pursuant to which we would through an appropriate business model develop and construct in phases a 2 gw pv power plant located within the ordos new energy industry demonstration zone in china in january 2011 we entered into a memorandum of understanding with china guangdong nuclear solar energy development co ltd to collaborate on the development of the 30 mw ordos phase one project these memoranda of understanding set forth the agreements in principle of the parties concerning the ordos project and related activities and are subject to the negotiation and execution of definitive agreements among the parties we plan to continue to work with the chinese government to establish the project economics 

  

customers 

  

with respect to our systems business our customers consist of investor owned utilities independent power developers and producers commercial and industrial companies and other system owners who purchase completed solar power plants epc services andor om services from us during 2010  the majority of our systems business sales were generated in north america 

  

during 2010  principal customers of our systems business were enbridge inc  sempra energy  and southern company  during 2010  each of these three customers individually accounted for between 10 and 51 of our systems segment’s net sales all of our other customers individually accounted for less than 10 of our net sales during 2010  

  

competition 

  

with respect to our systems business we face competition from other providers of renewable energy solutions including developers of pv solar thermal and concentrated solar power systems and developers of other forms of renewable energy projects including wind hydropower geothermal biomass and tidal projects to the extent other solar module manufacturers become more vertically integrated we expect to face increased competition from such companies as well we also face competition from other epc companies and joint ventures between epc companies and solar companies 

  

epc warranty 

  

in addition to our solar module warranty described above for solar power plants built by our epc team we typically provide a limited warranty against defects in workmanship engineering design and installation services under normal use and service conditions for a period of one year following the substantial completion of a solar power plant or an energized section of a solar power plant in resolving claims under both the workmanship and design warranties we have the option of either remedying the defect to the warranted level through repair refurbishment or replacement as of december 31 2010 and december 26 2009  our systems business accrued warranty liability was 14 million and 07 million  respectively all of which was classified as current 

  

support programs 

  

support programs for pv solar electricity generation depending on the jurisdiction include feedin tariffs fits quotas including renewable portfolio standards and tendering systems and net metering programs in addition to these financial incentives for renewables include tax incentives grants loans rebates and production incentives 

  

under a basic fit program producers of renewable energy are paid a set rate for their electricity usually differentiated according to the technology used and size of the installation for pv solar the rate has historically been set above above market rates and is fixed for a period of up to 25 years in most countries with fits grid operators are obliged to provide priority and guaranteed access to the grid for renewable energy installations the additional costs of these schemes are passed through to the electricity consumers by way of a premium on the kilowatt hour kwh enduser price these fit subsidies have been critical for the development of the solar industry because they provided the demand visibility required for module manufacturers and other participants in the solar value chain to reduce costs and drive scale historically the majority of our module sales have been for gridconnected ground or commercial roof mounted solar power systems in germany and other european union countries with fit subsidies 

  

whereas fit laws set the price and let the market determine capacity and generation quota systems work in reverse in general governments mandate a minimum share of capacity or grid connected generation of electricity to come from renewable energy sources this share often increases over time with a specific final target and enddate the mandate can be placed on producers 

  

distributors or consumers 

  

there are two main types of quota systems used obligationcertificate and tendering systems a renewable portfolio standard rps is in the former category under an rps regulated utilities are required to procure a specified percentage of their total electricity sales to enduser customers from eligible renewable resources such as solar generating facilities by a specified date some programs further require that a specified portion of the total percentage of renewable energy must come from solar generating facilities the majority of states in the us have enacted legislation adopting rps mechanisms rps legislation and implementing regulations vary significantly from state to state particularly with respect to the percentage of renewable energy required to achieve the states rps mandate the definition of eligible renewable energy resources and the extent to which renewable energy credits paper certificates representing the generation of renewable energy qualify for rps compliance currently there is no federal rps mandate california previously enacted rps legislation requiring 20 renewable energy by 2010 although recent legislation to increase californias rps mandate to 33 by 2020 has not become law the states agencies have been directed by executive order to plan for and adopt regulations requiring 33 renewable energy by 2020 measured in terms of the volume of renewable electricity required to meet its rps mandate californias rps program is the most significant in the us and the california market for renewable energy dominates the western us region 

  

net energy metering programs enable endusers to install renewable systems and to offset their retail energy consumption with production from onsite facilities and in some cases to sell excess solar electricity to their retail electricity provider because the bundled cost of retail electricity usually exceeds the cost of unbundled electricity net metering programs provide an incentive to the enduser based on the savings for the electricity system the policies governing net energy metering vary by state and utility some utilities pay the enduser in advance while others credit the endusers bill 

  

tax incentive programs exist in the united states at both the federal and state level and can take the form of investment and production tax credits accelerated depreciation and sales and property tax exemptions at the federal level investment tax credits for business and residential solar systems have gone through several cycles of enactment and expiration since the 1980s in october 2008 the united states congress extended the 30 federal investment tax credit itc for both residential and commercial solar installations for eight years through december 31 2016 the itc is a primary economic driver of solar installations in the united states its extension through 2016 has contributed to greater medium term demand visibility in the us however its expiration at the end of 2016 unless extended underscores the need for the levelized cost of electricity from solar systems to continue to decline toward grid parity in february 2009 the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 arra was signed into law in addition to adopting certain fiscal stimulus measures that could benefit ongrid solar electricity applications arra created a new program through the department of the treasury which provides cash grants equal to 30 of the cost of the system for solar installations that are placed into service during 2009 and 2010 and for certain solar installations for which construction begins prior to december 31 2010 this cash grant is available in lieu of receiving the 30 federal investment tax credit the intent of this program was to ensure that investors who had historically supported the renewable energy programs would not be constrained from investing in these transactions by tax losses they may have suffered during the recent credit crisis other measures adopted by arra that could benefit ongrid solar electricity generation include the following i a department of energy loan guarantee program for renewable energy projects renewable energy manufacturing facilities and electric power transmission projects and ii a 50 bonus depreciation for solar installations placed in service during 2009 in december 2010 the tax relief unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of 2010 2010 act was signed into law the 2010 act extended the department of the treasurys cash grant program for one year through december 31 2011 in addition the 2010 act extended and expanded the arra bonus depreciation program by providing for a 100 bonus depreciation for solar installations placed in service after september 8 2010 and before january 1 2012 and a 50 bonus depreciation for solar installations placed in service in 2012 

  

rebate programs for solar installations in california and several other states have increased the quantity of solar energy from distributed pv systems typically smaller nonutility scale pv systems colocated with residential or commercial rooftop endusers and have contributed to demand for pv solar modules and systems regulations and policies relating to electricity pricing and interconnection also stimulate demand for distributed generation from pv systems pv systems generate most of their electricity during midday and the early afternoon hours when the demand for and cost of electricity is highest as a result electricity generated by pv systems mainly competes with expensive peak hour electricity rather than the lower average price of electricity modifications to the peak hour pricing policies of utilities such as to a flat rate would require pv systems to achieve lower prices in order to compete with the price of electricity 

  

in europe renewable energy targets in conjunction with fits have contributed to the growth in pv solar markets renewable energy targets prescribe how much energy consumption must come from renewable sources while fit policies are intended to support new supply development by providing investor certainty a 2001 european union eu directive for promoting renewable energy use in electricity generation directive 200177ec set varying national indicative targets for renewable energy production from individual member states a 2009 eu directive on renewable energy directive 200928ec which replaced the 2001 

  

directive sets varying targets for all eu member states in support of the directives goal of a 20 share of energy from renewable sources in the eu by 2020 and requires national action plans that establish clear pathways for the development of renewable energy sources the following is a description of fit policies adopted in certain critical markets in support of renewable energy targets 

  

currently germany which accounted for approximately 46 of our 2010 net sales is the most significant market for our modules and changes to german fits are likely to affect the results of our operations the german renewable energy law or the eeg was last modified by the german government in 2010 with effect on july 1 and october 1 2010 at that time fits were significantly reduced from earlier levels declining 13 for roof mounted applications 12 for ground mounted applications and 8 for applications on conversion land an additional 3 cut in fit for all pv types was introduced on october 1 2010 

  

as of july 1 2010 there was no longer a fit for pv installations on agricultural land in germany subject to certain phaseout provisions new land types additional types of conversion land industrial areas and sites adjacent to highwaysrailways were included in the eeg and benefit from fits under the new legislation also the new legislation allows subsidies for ground mounted applications to continue after december 31 2014 

  

the next adjustment of fits for all types of renewable energy is scheduled for january 1 2012 however the german government is expected to adopt a partial acceleration of the january 2012 fit digression to mid2011 such a reduction in the fit including any potential further reductions may contribute to a shortterm pullin of demand but could negatively affect longterm demand and price levels for pv products in germany which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

in france which accounted for approximately 14 of our 2010 net sales and where we have announced plans to build a twoline manufacturing plant the government suspended the applicable fit legislation by decree for three months in december 2010 this moratorium does not apply to installations under 3 kw or larger projects for which ptfs  proposition technique et financière  had been accepted before december 2 2010 by the producer however these projects will have to be developed and connected within 18 months from the day of ptf acceptance in order to receive pricing under the fit for the electricity generated by the plants 

  

a new decree introducing a new market support framework is expected to be adopted by the french government during the first quarter of 2011 it is currently expected that the market will be capped at 500 mw per year with 200 mw allocated to the free field application and the remainder to large commercial roof and residential applications the french government is also considering a reduction of the fit as well as the introduction of a tender system for large projects as a result of the moratorium we have put the construction of our blanquefort france manufacturing plant on hold until we have greater clarity about the future of the french market 

  

in italy which accounted for approximately 9 of our 2010 net sales new fit legislation conto energia 3 has replaced the previous fit legislation conto energia 2 conto energia 3 has a threshold of 3 gw of installed ordinary pv plants after which a 14 month transition period will begin during which the tariffs of conto energia 3 still apply conto energia 3 expires at the latest on december 31 2013 or earlier if the threshold is reached the new conto energia 3 legislation foresees an expected average cut to fits of 18 compared to the previous legislation 

  

in spain which accounted for approximately 4 of our 2010 net sales the government published the latest fit for pv systems in november 2010 the fit levels will apply as of the second quarter of 2011 the fit is based on a mechanism that requires a pv system to be registered in a national registry in order to obtain the fit critically under the legislation only a certain number of megawatts mw of pv systems so registered are granted a fit each quarter 

  

in addition the spanish government adopted a new decree in december 2010 that includes several measures designed to reduce the cost of the fit the decree limits an installations operating hours that qualify for the fit and applies retroactively to all pv installations electricity generated beyond the limit can only be sold at market rates eligible hours to receive the fits vary by region among five zones and by whether the pv system is mounted in a fixed position or is mounted on a tracker system that moves the solar module to follow the sun during the day under the fit program operating hour limits will be reviewed periodically and yield improvements will be taken into consideration at that time 

  

in ontario canada a fit program was introduced in september 2009 and replaced the renewable energy standard offer program resop as the primary subsidy program for renewable energy projects in order to participate in the ontario fit program certain provisions relating to minimum required domestic content and agricultural land use restrictions for solar installations must be satisfied the domestic content and land restriction rules do not apply to our solar projects governed by resop contracts however pv solar power systems incorporating our modules do not presently satisfy the domestic content requirement under the 

  

fit program currently in effect 

  

in australia which accounted for less than 1 of our 2010 net sales the solar industry is driven by several regulatory initiatives that support the installation of solar pv modules in both rooftop and freefield applications including the federal governments solar flagship program state fits and the nationwide renewable energy target scheme which has set a renewable energy goal for australia of 20 by 2020 

  

in china governmental authorities have not adopted a fit policy and currently award solar projects through either a project tendering process or bilateral negotiations we did not have sales in china in 2010  however we have entered into a memorandum of understanding with the ordos china city government relating to the construction of a 2 gw pv power plant located within the ordos new energy industry demonstration zone in china and in january 2011 we entered into a memorandum of understanding with china guangdong nuclear solar energy development co ltd to collaborate on the development of the 30 mw ordos phase one project see item 1 business  segment information systems business  project development” 

  

in india the national solar mission includes a goal of installing 22 gw of solar power generation capability by 2022 india also announced a fit for the first phase of the national solar mission in 2010 during 2010 we had 10 mw of sales in india 

  

for more information about risks related to economic incentives please see item 1a risk factors — reduced growth in or the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives and other support for ongrid solar electricity applications including potential midyear fit reductions in germany and certain other core markets could reduce demand andor price levels for our solar modules and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales and adversely impact our operating results

 item 1a risk factors 

  

an investment in our stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the following information together with the other information in this annual report on form 10k before buying shares of our stock if any of the following risks or uncertainties occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our stock could decline 

  

risks related to our markets and customers 

  

  

if pv technology is not suitable for widespread adoption at economically attractive rates of return or if sufficient demand for solar modules does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate our net sales and profit may flatten or decline and we may be unable to sustain profitability 

  

the solar energy market is at a relatively early stage of development and the extent to which solar modules will be widely adopted is uncertain if pv technology proves unsuitable for widespread adoption at economically attractive rates of return or if demand for solar modules fails to develop sufficiently or takes longer to develop than we anticipate we may be unable to grow our business or generate sufficient net sales to sustain profitability in addition demand for solar modules in our targeted markets — including germany italy spain france the united states canada india china and australia — may develop to a lesser extent than we anticipate many factors may affect the viability of widespread adoption of pv technology and demand for solar modules including the following 

  

   

   

 13 

  

renewable energy sources and products 

  

   

   

   

reduced growth in or the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives and other support for ongrid solar electricity applications including potential 2011 midyear feedintariff reductions in germany and certain other core markets could reduce demand andor price levels for our solar modules and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales and adversely impact our operating results 

  

we believe that the nearterm growth of the market for ongrid applications where solar energy is used to supplement the electricity a consumer purchases from the utility network depends significantly on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives federal state and local governmental bodies in many countries most notably germany italy spain france the united states canada china india and australia have provided subsidies in the form of fit rebates tax incentives and other incentives to endusers distributors systems integrators and manufacturers of pv products many of these jurisdictions including the majority of us states and numerous european union countries have adopted renewable portfolio standards in which the government requires jurisdictions or regulated utilities to supply a portion of their total electricity from specified sources of renewable energy such as solar wind and hydroelectric power many of these government incentives expire phase out over time require renewal by the applicable authority or may be amended in light of strong 2010 solar growth the major european governments are currently seeking to balance subsidy burdens with their commitment to the eu directives goal of a 20 share of energy from renewable sources in the eu by 2020 a summary of recent developments in the major government subsidy programs in our core markets appears under item 1 business  support programs we expect the fit in germany and certain other core markets to be reduced earlier than previously expected and such reductions could reduce demand andor price levels for our solar modules lead to a reduction in our net sales and adversely impact our operating results 

  

currently germany which accounted for approximately 46 of our net sales in 2010  is the largest market for our modules and thus recently proposed changes to german feedin tariffs could significantly impact our results of operations the german government is expected to adopt a partial acceleration of the january 2012 fit digression to mid2011 such a reduction in the german fit including any potential further reductions may contribute to a shortterm pullin of demand but could negatively affect longterm demand and price levels for pv products in germany which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition andor results of operations 

  

in france the government suspended the fit legislation by decree for three months in december 2010 although a new decree introducing a new market support framework is expected to be adopted by the government during the first quarter of 2011 we cannot be certain that such market support framework will be adopted at all or adopted at meaningful levels if the level of such new market support framework is not adequate to promote the development of the pv industry or pv projects in france our ability to pursue an expansion strategy in france would be adversely affected as a result of the moratorium we have put the construction of our blanquefort france manufacturing plant on hold until we have greater clarity about the future of the french market 

  

in italy and spain we cannot be certain that the level of fits will be adequate to promote the development of the pv industry or pv projects in these countries in which case our ability to pursue an expansion strategy in these countries would be adversely affected these expansion strategies could be further adversely affected to the extent of any acceleration or imposition of fit reductions caps or other limitations in these countries 

  

in the united states california has been the state where the majority of solar installations and solar power module and system sales have taken place in recent years the state of california’s rps goal of 33 of electricity from renewable sources by 2020 currently in the form of an executive order from the governor’s office is the most significant rps program in the united states in magnitude and is contributing to the expansion of the utilityscale solar systems market in that state however the continued effectiveness of this rps program could be negatively impacted if the rps goal is not passed by the california legislature and signed into law see item 1a risk factors — our ability to pursue an expansion strategy in california beyond existing projects may be adversely affected if california is unable to achieve a 33 renewable mandate through law” below 

  

  

the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 arra and the 2010 tax act provide for certain measures intended to benefit ongrid solar electricity generation and other renewable energy initiatives the failure to further extend or enhance these programs may reduce tax equity availability in the case of the grant expiration which may adversely affect our ability to arrange financing for utilityscale projects and may otherwise adversely affect the attractiveness of the us solar market 

  

in ontario canada a fit program was introduced in september 2009 and replaced the renewable energy standard offer program resop as the primary subsidy program for renewable energy projects in order to participate in the ontario fit program certain provisions relating to minimum required domestic content and agricultural land use restrictions for solar installations must be satisfied the domestic content and land restriction rules do not apply to our solar projects governed by resop contracts however pv solar power systems incorporating our modules do not presently satisfy the domestic content requirement under the fit program currently in effect and thus projects incorporating our modules would not qualify for the ontario fit in the event the ontario domestic content and land use restriction rules are not sufficiently modified our ability to participate in the ontario fit program for future projects beyond our existing resop projects will be substantially reduced and possibly completely eliminated and thus our ability to pursue an expansion strategy in ontario canada beyond our existing resop projects would be adversely affected 

  

in australia the solar industry is driven by several regulatory initiatives that support the installation of solar pv modules in both rooftop and free field applications including the federal governments solar flagship program state fits and the nationwide renewable energy target scheme which has set a renewable energy goal for australia of 20 by 2020 if such programs or other initiatives are not successfully executed in addressing australias renewable energy goals the size and attractiveness of australias solar market may be limited and we may be unable to sell modules or systems in australia at an attractive price limiting one of our anticipated growth markets 

  

in china governmental authorities have not adopted a fit policy and currently award solar projects through either a project tendering process or bilateral negotiations while the solar industry generally anticipates that china will adopt a solar fit there is no guarantee this will occur in a timely manner or at all or that any fit will be economically viable without a fit the size and attractiveness of china’s solar market may be limited the viability of our proposed ordos project may be negatively impacted and we may be otherwise unable to sell into china at an attractive price limiting one of our anticipated growth markets 

  

in india the national solar mission includes a goal of installing 22 gw of solar by 2022 india has announced a fit for the first phase of the national solar mission in 2010 t here is no guarantee that india will maintain its current goal of 22 gw by 2022 or adopt the required policies to meet that goal without which the size and attractiveness of india’s solar market may be limited and we may be unable to sell modules or systems in india at an attractive price limiting one of our anticipated growth markets 

  

emerging subsidy programs may require an extended period of time to attain effectiveness because the applicable permitting and grid connection processes associated with these programs can be lengthy and administratively burdensome in addition if any of these statutes or regulations is found to be unconstitutional or is reduced or discontinued for other reasons sales prices andor volumes of our solar modules in these countries could decline significantly which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations electric utility companies or generators of electricity from fossil fuels or other renewable energy sources could also lobby for a change in the relevant legislation in their markets to protect their revenue streams 

  

reduced growth in or the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar energy applications especially those in our target markets could limit our growth or cause our net sales to decline and materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our ability to pursue an expansion strategy in california beyond existing projects may be adversely affected if california is unable to achieve a 33 renewable mandate through law 

  

california required its investorowned utilities ious to procure 20 of their electricity supplies through eligible renewable energy resources by 2010 in addition california through executive order has established a utility procurement goal of 33 renewable electricity by 2020 however since the 33 procurement of renewable electricity by 2020 goal is currently not enforceable through law it is conceivable that renewable energy procurement in california could peak at a level below 33 of the iou’s electricity retail sales if the 33 renewable mandate is not signed into law if the state legislature and governor’s office are unable to adopt legislation establishing the 33 renewable energy mandate the viability of the 33 rps program would remain at risk in addition any weakening or delay of the 33 rps program could contribute to or be accompanied by increased project execution risks delay or costs relating to california authorities such as the california independent system operator 

  

under such a scenario our ability to execute a longterm expansion plan to develop additional largescale pv projects in california could be adversely affected 

  

an increase in interest rates or lending rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets including a reduction in total tax equity availability could make it difficult for endusers to finance the cost of a pv system and could reduce the demand for our solar modules andor lead to a reduction in the average selling price for pv modules 

  

many of our customers and our systems business depend on debt andor equity financing to fund the initial capital expenditure required to develop build and purchase a pv system as a result an increase in interest rates or lending rates or a reduction in the supply of project debt financing or tax equity investments could reduce the number of solar projects that receive financing or otherwise make it difficult for our customers or our systems business to secure the financing necessary to develop build purchase or install a pv system on favorable terms or at all and thus lower demand for our solar modules which could limit our growth or reduce our net sales in addition we believe that a significant percentage of our endusers install pv systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt an increase in interest rates andor lending rates could lower an investors return on investment in a pv system increase equity return requirements or make alternative investments more attractive relative to pv systems and in each case could cause these endusers to seek alternative investments as described above under item 1 business — support programs” the 30 grant in lieu of the federal investment tax credit under the arra is set to expire and unless extended will not be available for solar installations that begin construction on or after january 1 2012 if such program is not extended total tax equity availability could be reduced which may adversely affect our ability to arrange financing for utilityscale projects and may adversely affect the attractiveness of the us solar market 

  

we currently sell a substantial portion of our solar modules under supply contracts and we allocate a significant amount of our production to satisfy our obligations under these contracts these customers buy our modules with the expectation that they will be able to resell them in connection with the development of pv systems as discussed above many of these projects depend on the availability of debt and equity financing a prolonged material disruption to the supply of project finance could adversely affect our customers’ ability to perform under these agreements in the event of default by one or more of these customers we may be unable to sell these modules at the prices specified in our supply contracts especially if demand for pv systems softens or supply of solar modules increases also we may decide to lower our average selling price to certain customers in certain markets in response to changes in economic circumstances of our customers their end markets or the capital markets see item 1 business — segment information — components business — customers” for a description of previous pricing adjustments under our supply contracts 

  

we currently depend on a limited number of customers with three customers accounting for a majority of our components business’ net sales last year the loss of or a significant reduction in orders from any of these customers could significantly reduce our net sales and negatively impact our operating results 

  

we currently sell the majority of our solar modules to customers headquartered throughout the european union during 2010  our three largest customers for our components business each accounted for between 10 and 20 of our components business’ net sales our customer base within our components business is currently concentrated to a significant extent in germany and therefore additional german fit reductions could reduce demand andor price levels for our modules sold to these customers the loss of any of our large customers their inability to perform under their contracts or their default in payment could significantly reduce our net sales and adversely impact our operating results our customers may face significant challenges under current economic conditions including lack of capital to finance solar projects and rising costs associated with leasing or otherwise acquiring land and rooftops for solar projects we believe that we can mitigate this risk by reallocating modules to other customers if the need arises but we may be unable in whole or in part to mitigate the reduced demand for our modules in the event that we determine that our planned production of solar modules exceeds the demand we anticipate we may decide to reduce or halt production of solar modules in our manufacturing facilities however we may be unable to anticipate and respond to the oversupply of solar modules because we have limited visibility into our customers’ inventories 

  

risks related to regulations 

  

existing regulations and policies and changes to these regulations and policies may present technical regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of pv products which may significantly reduce demand for our solar modules 

  

the market for electricity generation products is heavily influenced by foreign federal state and local government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry as well as policies promulgated by electric utilities these regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customerowned electricity generation in the united states and in a number of other countries these regulations and policies have been modified in the past and may be modified again in the future these regulations and policies could deter enduser purchases of pv products and investment in the research and 

  

development of pv technology for example without a mandated regulatory exception for pv systems utility customers are often charged interconnection or standby fees for putting distributed power generation on the electric utility grid if these interconnection standby fees were applicable to pv systems it is likely that they would increase the cost to our endusers of using pv systems which could make them less desirable thereby harming our business prospects results of operations and financial condition in addition electricity generated by pv systems mostly competes with expensive peak hour electricity rather than the less expensive average price of electricity modifications to the peak hour pricing policies of utilities such as to a flat rate for all times of the day would require pv systems to achieve lower prices in order to compete with the price of electricity from other sources 

  

we anticipate that our solar modules and their installation will be subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with national and local ordinances relating to building codes safety environmental protection utility interconnection and metering and related matters it is difficult to track the requirements of individual states and design equipment to comply with the varying standards any new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to our solar modules may result in significant additional expenses to us our resellers and their customers and as a result could cause a significant reduction in demand for our solar modules 

  

environmental obligations and liabilities could have a substantial negative impact on our financial condition cash flows and profitability 

  

our operations involve the use handling generation processing storage transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations at the national state local and international levels these environmental laws and regulations include those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the use management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites and occupational health and safety we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs and capital expenditures in complying with these laws and regulations in addition violations of or liabilities under environmental laws or permits may result in restrictions being imposed on our operating activities or in our being subjected to substantial fines penalties criminal proceedings third party property damage or personal injury claims cleanup costs or other costs while we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements future developments such as more aggressive enforcement policies the implementation of new more stringent laws and regulations or the discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

in addition our products contain cadmium telluride and cadmium sulfide elemental cadmium and certain of its compounds are regulated as hazardous material due to the adverse health effects that may arise from human exposure although the risks of exposure to cadmium telluride are not believed to be as serious as those relating to exposure to elemental cadmium the chemical physical and toxicological properties of cadmium telluride have not been thoroughly investigated and reported in our manufacturing operations we maintain engineering controls to minimize our associates’ exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds and require our associates who handle cadmium compounds to follow certain safety procedures including the use of personal protective equipment such as respirators chemical goggles and protective clothing in addition we believe the risk of exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds from our endproducts is limited by the encapsulated nature of these materials in our products and the physical properties of cadmium compounds used in our products and further minimized by the voluntary implementation in 2005 of our collection and recycling program for our solar modules while we believe that these factors and procedures are sufficient to protect our associates endusers and the general public from adverse health effects that may arise from cadmium exposure we cannot assure that human or environmental exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds used in our products will not occur any such exposure could result in future third party claims against us as well as damage to our reputation and heightened regulatory scrutiny of our products which could limit or impair our ability to sell and distribute our products the occurrence of future events such as these could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

the use of cadmium in various products is also coming under increasingly stringent governmental regulation future regulation in this area could impact the manufacture sale collection and recycling of solar modules and could require us to make unforeseen environmental expenditures or limit our ability to sell and distribute our products for example european union directive 200295ec on the restriction of the use of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment rohs directive restricts the use of certain hazardous substances including cadmium in specified products other jurisdictions such as china have adopted similar legislation or are considering doing so currently pv solar modules are not subject to the rohs directive however the rohs directive allows for future amendments subjecting additional products to the requirements and the scope applicability and the products included in the directive may also change in december 2008 the european commission issued its proposed revision of the rohs directive this proposed revision did not include pv solar modules in the scope of rohs in november 2010 the european parliament european commission and european council agreed on a revised rohs directive under which all electrical and electronic equipment eee are included in the scope of the rohs directive unless specifically excluded or exempted from coverage pv is explicitly excluded from the scope of rohs article 2 the european parliament formally adopted the agreement 

  

in november 2010 and the council is expected to formally adopt the agreement in the first half of 2011 nevertheless if pv modules are included in the scope of rohs without an exemption or exclusion we would be required to redesign our solar modules to eliminate cadmium in order to continue to offer them for sale within the european union which would be impractical in such event the european union market would be in effect closed to us which would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in 2010 74 of our total net sales were generated from module sales in the european union 

  

risks related to our operations manufacturing and technology 

  

our operating history to date may not serve as an adequate basis to judge our future prospects and results of operations 

  

our historical operating results may not provide a meaningful basis for evaluating our business financial performance and prospects while our net sales grew from 1350 million in 2006 to nearly 26 billion in 2010  we may be unable to achieve similar growth or grow at all in future periods our ability to achieve similar growth in future periods is also affected by current economic conditions our past results occurred in an environment where among other things capital was generally more accessible to our customers to finance the cost of developing solar projects and economic incentives for solar power in certain core markets such as the german fit were more favorable accordingly you should not rely on our results of operations for any prior period as an indication of our future performance see item 1 business — segment information — components business — customers” for a description of previous pricing adjustments under our supply contracts 

  

we face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules thinfilm solar modules and solar thermal and concentrated pv systems if global supply exceeds global demand it could lead to a reduction in the average selling price for pv modules  which could reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations 

  

the solar energy and renewable energy industries are highly competitive and continually evolving as participants strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete with the larger electric power industry within the global pv industry we face competition from crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers other thinfilm solar module manufacturers and companies developing solar thermal and concentrated pv technologies existing or future solar manufacturers might be acquired by larger companies with significant capital resources thereby intensifying competition with us in addition the introduction of a low cost disruptive technology could adversely affect our ability to compete which could reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations 

  

even if demand for solar modules continues to grow the rapid expansion plans of many solar module manufacturers could create periods where supply exceeds demand in addition we believe a significant decrease in the cost of silicon feedstock would provide significant reductions in the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules and lead to pricing pressure for solar modules and potentially the oversupply of solar modules 

  

during any such period our competitors could decide to reduce their sales prices in response to competition even below their manufacturing costs in order to generate sales as a result we may be unable to sell our solar modules at attractive prices or for a profit during any period of excess supply of solar modules which would reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations also we may decide to lower our average selling price to certain customers in certain markets in response to competition 

  

thinfilm technology has a short history and our thinfilm technology and solar modules and systems may perform below expectations problems with product quality or performance may cause us to incur warranty expenses damage our market reputation and prevent us from maintaining or increasing our market share 

  

researchers began developing thinfilm semiconductor technology over 20 years ago but were unable to integrate the technology into a solar module production line until several years ago our thinfilm technology and solar modules may not have a sufficient operating history to confirm how our solar modules will perform over their estimated 25year useful life we perform a variety of quality and life tests under different conditions however if our thinfilm technology and solar modules perform below expectations we could lose customers and face substantial warranty expense 

  

our solar modules are sold with a fiveyear materials and workmanship warranty for technical defects and a 25year warranty against declines of more than 10 of their initial rated power in the first 10 years following their installation and 20 of initial rated power in the following 15 years respectively as a result we bear the risk of extensive warranty claims long after we have sold our solar modules and recognized net sales as of december 31 2010  our accrued warranty liability was 279 million  of which 112 million was classified as current and 167 million was classified as noncurrent 

  

  

although our power output warranty extends for 25 years our oldest solar modules manufactured during the qualification of our pilot production line have only been in use since 2001 because of the limited operating history of our solar modules we have been required to make assumptions regarding the durability and reliability of our solar modules our assumptions could prove to be materially different from the actual performance of our solar modules causing us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective solar modules in the future for example our glassonglass solar modules could break delaminate or experience power degradation in excess of expectations and our manufacturing operations could be subject to process variations that could cause affected modules to underperform compared to our expectations any widespread product failures may damage our market reputation and cause our sales to decline and require us to repair or replace the defective modules which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

  

in addition to our solar module warranty described above for solar power plants built by our epc team we currently typically provide a limited epc warranty against defects in workmanship engineering design and installation services under normal use and service conditions for a period of one year following the substantial completion of a solar power plant or an energized section of a solar power plant in resolving claims under both the workmanship and design warranties we have the option of either remedying the defect to the warranted level through repair refurbishment or replacement any widespread failures of solar power plants built by us could damage our market reputation cause our sales to decline cause us to incur unexpected costs to remedy defects or otherwise negatively affect our results of operations 

  

if our estimates regarding the future cost of collecting and recycling our solar modules are incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses at and from the time we realize our estimates are incorrect and face a significant unplanned cash burden 

  

we prefund our estimated future obligation for collecting and recycling our solar modules based on the present value of the expected future cost of collecting and recycling the modules which includes the cost of packaging the solar modules for transport the cost of freight from the solar module’s installation site to a recycling center the material labor and capital costs of the recycling process and an estimated third party profit margin and return on risk for collection and recycling we base our estimate on our experience collecting and recycling solar modules that do not pass our quality control tests and solar modules returned under our warranty and on our expectations about future developments in recycling technologies and processes and economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled if our estimates prove incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses at and from the time we realize our estimates are incorrect and also face a significant unplanned cash burden at the time we realize our estimates are incorrect or endusers return their solar modules which could harm our operating results in addition our endusers can return their solar modules at any time as a result we could be required to collect and recycle our solar modules earlier than we expect 

  

our failure to further refine our technology and develop and introduce improved pv products could render our solar modules or systems uncompetitive and reduce our net sales profitability andor market share 

  

we need to invest significant financial resources in research and development to continue to improve our module conversion efficiency lower the levelized cost of electricity lcoe of our pv systems and otherwise keep pace with technological advances in the solar energy industry however research and development activities are inherently uncertain and we could encounter practical difficulties in commercializing our research results we seek to continuously improve our products and processes and the resulting changes carry potential risks in the form of delays additional costs or other unintended contingencies in addition our significant expenditures on research and development may not produce corresponding benefits other companies are developing a variety of competing pv technologies including copper indium gallium diselenide and amorphous silicon which could produce solar modules or systems that prove more costeffective or have better performance than our solar modules or systems in addition other companies could potentially develop a highly reliable renewable energy system that mitigates the intermittent power production drawback of many renewable energy systems or offers other valueadded improvements from the perspective of utilities and other system owners in which case such companies could compete with us even if the lcoe associated with such new system is higher than that of our systems as a result our solar modules or systems may be negatively differentiated or rendered obsolete by the technological advances of our competitors which would reduce our net sales profitability andor market share 

  

in addition we often forward price our products and services including through our supply contracts and power purchase agreements in anticipation of future cost reductions and thus an inability to further refine our technology and execute our longterm manufacturing cost and lcoe reduction objectives could adversely affect our margins and operating results 

  

our failure to protect our intellectual property rights may undermine our competitive position and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against third party allegations of infringement may be costly 

  

protection of our proprietary processes methods and other technology is critical to our business failure to protect and 

  

monitor the use of our existing intellectual property rights could result in the loss of valuable technologies we rely primarily on patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property we regularly file patent applications to protect inventions arising from our research and development and are currently pursuing such patent applications in the us and worldwide our existing patents and future patents could be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents or if patents are issued to us such patents may not be sufficient to provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies 

  

we also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position although we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our associates and third parties to protect our intellectual property such confidentiality agreements are limited in duration and could be breached and may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary manufacturing expertise adequate remedies may not be available in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise in addition others may obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or legal means the failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes equipment technology trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise methods and compounds could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries especially any developing countries into which we may expand our operations in some countries we have not applied for patent trademark or copyright protection 

  

third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary technologies or other intellectual property rights which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology can be difficult and expensive also litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others we cannot assure you that the outcome of such potential litigation will be in our favor such litigation may be costly and may divert management attention and other resources away from our business an adverse determination in any such litigation may impair our intellectual property rights and may harm our business prospects and reputation in addition we have no insurance coverage against litigation costs and would have to bear all costs arising from such litigation to the extent we are unable to recover them from other parties 

  

some of our key raw materials and components are either singlesourced or sourced from a limited number of third party suppliers and their failure to perform could cause manufacturing delays and impair our ability to deliver solar modules to customers in the required quality and quantities and at a price that is profitable to us 

  

our failure to obtain raw materials and components that meet our quality quantity and cost requirements in a timely manner could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture our solar modules or increase our manufacturing cost some of our key raw materials and components are either singlesourced or sourced from a limited number of third party suppliers as a result the failure of any of our suppliers to perform could disrupt our supply chain and impair our operations in addition some of our suppliers are small companies that may be unable to supply our increasing demand for raw materials and components as we continue to expand rapidly we may be unable to identify new suppliers or qualify their products for use on our production lines in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms a constraint on our production may cause us to be unable to meet our capacity ramp plan andor our obligations under our customer contracts which would have an adverse impact on our financial results 

  

a disruption in our supply chain for cadmium telluride our semiconductor material could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture solar modules 

  

a key raw material we use in our production process is a cadmium telluride compound tellurium one of the main components of cadmium telluride is mainly produced as a byproduct of copper refining and therefore its supply is largely dependent upon demand for copper our supply of cadmium telluride could be limited if any of our current suppliers or any of our future suppliers are unable to acquire an adequate supply of tellurium in a timely manner or at commercially reasonable prices if our competitors begin to use or increase their demand for cadmium telluride supply could be reduced and prices could increase if our current suppliers or any of our future suppliers cannot obtain sufficient tellurium they could substantially increase prices or be unable to perform under their contracts we may be unable to pass increases in the cost of our raw materials through to our customers because our customer contracts do not adjust for raw material price increases and are generally for a longer term than our raw material supply contracts a reduction in our production could result in our inability to meet our capacity ramp plan andor our commitments under our customer contracts which would have an adverse impact on our financial results 

  

our future success depends on our ability to continue to build new manufacturing plants and add production lines in a costeffective manner both of which are subject to risks and uncertainties 

  

our future success depends on our ability to significantly increase both our manufacturing capacity and production throughput 

  

in a costeffective and efficient manner if we cannot do so we may be unable to expand our business decrease our manufacturing cost per watt maintain our competitive position satisfy our contractual obligations or sustain profitability our ability to expand production capacity is subject to significant risks and uncertainties including the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

if our future production lines are not built in line with our committed schedules it may impair our growth plans if our future production lines do not achieve operating metrics similar to our existing production lines our solar modules could perform below expectations and cause us to lose customers 

  

currently our production lines have a limited history of operating at full capacity future production lines could produce solar modules that have lower efficiencies higher failure rates and higher rates of degradation than solar modules from our existing production lines and we could be unable to determine the cause of the lower operating metrics or develop and implement solutions to improve performance although we will be using the same systematic replication process to build our us vietnamese and french manufacturing centers and expand our german and malaysian manufacturing centers that we successfully used when previously building and expanding our existing german and malaysian production facilities our replication risk in connection with building production lines at our manufacturing centers and other future manufacturing plants could be higher than our replication risk was in building and expanding our existing german and malaysian production facilities because these new manufacturing centers will be located in new geographic areas for us which could entail other factors that may lower their operating metrics if we are unable to systematically replicate our production lines to meet our committed schedules and achieve and sustain similar operating metrics in our future production lines as we have achieved at our existing production lines our manufacturing capacity could be substantially constrained our manufacturing costs per watt could increase and this may impair our growth plans andor cause us to lose customers resulting in lower net sales higher liabilities and lower net income than we anticipate in addition we might be unable to produce enough solar modules to satisfy our contractual requirements under our customer contracts 

  

some of our manufacturing equipment is customized and sole sourced if our manufacturing equipment fails or if our equipment suppliers fail to perform under their contracts we could experience production disruptions and be unable to satisfy our contractual requirements 

  

some of our manufacturing equipment is customized to our production lines based on designs or specifications that we provide to the equipment manufacturer which then undertakes a specialized process to manufacture the custom equipment as a result the equipment is not readily available from multiple vendors and would be difficult to repair or replace if it were to become damaged or stop working if any piece of equipment fails production along the entire production line could be interrupted and we could be unable to produce enough solar modules to satisfy our contractual requirements under our supply contracts in addition the failure of our equipment suppliers to supply equipment in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms could delay our expansion plans and otherwise disrupt our production schedule or increase our manufacturing costs all of which would adversely impact our financial results 

  

if we are unable to further increase the number of sellable watts per solar module and reduce our manufacturing cost per watt we could be in default under certain of our supply contracts and our profitability could decline 

  

our supply contracts either i require us to increase the minimum average number of watts per module over the term of the contract or ii have a price adjustment for increases or decreases in the number of watts per module relative to a base number of 

  

watts per module our failure to achieve these metrics could reduce our profitability or allow some of our customers to terminate their contracts in addition all of our supply contracts in europe specify a sales price per watt that declines at the beginning of each year through the expiration date of each contract in 2012 our profitability could decline if we are unable to reduce our manufacturing cost per watt by at least the same rate at which our contractual prices decrease furthermore our failure to reduce cost per watt by increasing our efficiency may impair our ability to enter new markets that we believe will require lower cost per watt for us to be competitive and may impair our growth plans 

  

we may be unable to manage the expansion of our operations effectively 

  

we expect to continue to expand our business in order to meet our contractual obligations satisfy demand for our solar modules and maintain or increase market share however depending on the amount of additional contractual obligations we enter into and our ability to expand our manufacturing capabilities in accordance with our expectations we might be unable to produce enough solar modules to satisfy our contractual requirements under our customer contracts and other commitments in which case we could be in default under such agreements and our operating results may be adversely affected 

  

to manage the continued rapid expansion of our operations we will be required to continue to improve our operational and financial systems procedures and controls and expand train and manage our growing associate base our management will also be required to maintain and expand our relationships with customers suppliers and other third parties and attract new customers and suppliers in addition our current and planned operations personnel systems and internal controls and procedures might be inadequate to support our future growth if we cannot manage our growth effectively we may be unable to take advantage of market opportunities execute our business strategies or respond to competitive pressures 

  

implementing a new enterprise resource planning system could interfere with our business or operations and could adversely impact our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

we are in the process of implementing a new enterprise resource planning erp system phase 1 of this implementation was completed in the second half of 2010 and the second and final phase of this implementation is expected to be completed in the second half of 2011 this project requires significant investment of capital and human resources the reengineering of many processes of our business and the attention of many associates and managers who would otherwise be focused on other aspects of our business any disruptions delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of the new erp system could result in potentially much higher costs than we had anticipated and could adversely affect our ability to process customer orders ship products provide services and support to customers bill and track our customers fulfill contractual obligations file sec reports in a timely manner andor otherwise operate our business or otherwise impact our controls environment and any of these consequences could have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

  

our substantial international operations subject us to a number of risks including unfavorable political regulatory labor and tax conditions in foreign countries 

  

we have significant marketing distribution and manufacturing operations both within and outside the united states in 2010  74 of our net sales were generated from customers headquartered in the european union in the future we expect to expand our operations into china india and other countries in europe asia the middle east and elsewhere as a result we will be subject to the legal political social tax and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions risks inherent to international operations include but are not limited to the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

 22 

  

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our business in foreign markets requires us to respond to rapid changes in market conditions in these countries our overall success as a global business depends in part on our ability to succeed in differing legal regulatory economic social and political conditions we may not be able to develop and implement policies and strategies that will be effective in each location where we do business 

  

risks related to our systems business 

  

project development or construction activities may not be successful and projects under development may not receive required permits or construction may not commence as scheduled which could increase our costs and impair our ability to recover our investments 

  

the development and construction of solar power electric generation facilities and other energy infrastructure projects involve numerous risks we may be required to spend significant sums for preliminary engineering permitting legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built success in developing a particular project is contingent upon among other things 

  

   

   

   

   

   

successful completion of a particular project may be adversely affected by numerous factors including 

  

   

   

   

   

 23 

  

  

   

   

   

   

   

if we are unable to complete the development of a solar power facility or fail to meet one or more agreed target construction milestone dates we may be subject to liquidated damages andor penalties under the epc agreement or other agreements relating to the project and we typically will not be able to recover our investment in the project some of these investments are included as assets on our consolidated balance sheet under the line item “project assets” if we are unable to complete the development of a solar power project we may writedown or writeoff some or all of these capitalized investments which would have an adverse impact on our net income in the period in which the loss is recognized in 2011 we expect to invest a significant amount of capital to develop projects owned by us or third parties 

  

we may enter into fixed price epc contracts in which we act as the general contractor for our customers in connection with the installation of our solar power systems all essential costs are estimated at the time of entering into the epc contract for a particular project and these are reflected in the overall price that we charge our customers for the project these cost estimates are preliminary and may or may not be covered by contracts between us or the subcontractors suppliers and other parties to the project in addition we require qualified licensed subcontractors to install most of our systems shortages of such skilled labor could significantly delay a project or otherwise increase our costs should miscalculations in planning a project occur including those due to unexpected increases in inflation or commodity prices or delays in execution occur and we are unable to increase commensurately the epc sales price we may not achieve our expected margins or we may be required to record a loss in the relevant fiscal period 

  

we may be unable to acquire or lease land andor obtain the approvals licenses and permits necessary to build and operate pv power plants in a timely and cost effective manner and regulatory agencies local communities labor unions or other third parties may delay prevent or increase the cost of construction and operation of the pv plants we intend to build 

  

in order to construct and operate our pv plants we need to acquire or lease land and obtain all necessary local county state federal and foreign approvals licenses and permits we may be unable to acquire the land or lease interests needed may not receive or retain the requisite approvals permits and licenses or may encounter other problems which could delay or prevent us from successfully constructing and operating pv plants for instance the california independent system operator has modified its transmission interconnection rules phasing out a serial process in favor of a cluster process for new projects and may further modify its rules in a manner that could negatively impact our favorable position in transmission queues certain of our california projects under development will remain subject to the serial process while other projects in earlier stages of development as well as new projects on a goingforward basis will be subject to the cluster process although the transition to the cluster process is still evolving and its ultimate impact is not yet fully known our project transmission cost could be materially higher than previously estimated under the serial process and our projects could be delayed or subject to transmission planning timing uncertainties we also may be required to post interconnection deposits which may not be refundable sooner than previously estimated under the serial process 

  

many of our proposed pv plants are located on or require access through public lands administered by federal and state agencies pursuant to competitive public leasing and rightofway procedures and processes the authorization for the use construction and operation of pv plants and associated transmission facilities on federal state and private lands will also require the assessment and evaluation of mineral rights private rightsofway and other easements environmental agricultural cultural recreational and aesthetic impacts and the likely mitigation of adverse impacts to these and other resources and uses the inability to obtain the required permits and potentially excessive delay in obtaining such permits due for example to litigation or third party appeals could prevent us from successfully constructing and operating pv plants in a timely manner and could result in a potential forfeiture of any deposit we have made with respect to a given project moreover project approvals subject to project modifications and conditions including mitigation requirements and costs could affect the financial success of a given project 

  

in addition local labor unions may increase the cost of andor lower the productivity of project development in canada california and elsewhere we may also be subject to labor unavailability andor increased union labor requirements due to multiple simultaneous projects in a geographic region 

  

  

in china our projects are subject to a number of government approvals including the approval of a prefeasibility and feasibility study individually the prefeasibility and feasibility study require many different government approvals at the national provincial and local levels and the approval process is discretionary and not fully transparent 

  

lack of transmission capacity availability potential upgrade costs to the transmission grid and other systems constraints could significantly impact our ability to build pv plants and generate solar electricity power sales 

  

in order to deliver electricity from our pv plants to our customers our projects need to connect to the transmission grid the lack of available capacity on the transmission grid could substantially impact our projects and cause reductions in project size delays in project implementation increases in costs from transmission upgrades and potential forfeitures of any deposit we have made with respect to a given project these transmission issues as well as issues relating to the availability of large systems such as transformers and switch gear could significantly impact our ability to build pv plants and generate solar electricity sales 

  

our systems business is largely dependent on us and third parties arranging financing from various sources which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms or in insufficient amounts 

  

the construction of the large utilityscale solar power projects under development by us is expected in many cases to require project financing including nonrecourse project debt financing in the bank loan market and institutional debt capital markets uncertainties exist as to whether our projects will be able to access the debt markets in a sufficient magnitude to finance their construction if we are unable to arrange such financing or if it is only available on unfavorable terms we may be unable to fully execute our systems business plan in addition we generally expect to sell our projects by raising project equity capital from tax oriented strategic industry and other equity investors such equity sources may not be available or may only be available in insufficient amounts in which case our ability to sell our projects may be delayed or limited and our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

  

in addition for projects in which we provide epc services but are not the project developer our epc activities are in many cases dependent on the ability of third parties to purchase our pv plant projects which in turn is dependent on their ability to obtain financing for such purchases depending on prevailing conditions in the credit markets and other factors such financing may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms or in insufficient amounts if third parties are limited in their ability to access financing to support their purchase of pv power plant projects from us we may not realize the cash flows that we expect from such sales and this could adversely affect our ability to invest in our business andor generate revenue see also the risk factor above entitled  an increase in interest rates or lending rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets including a reduction in total tax equity availability could make it difficult for endusers to finance the cost of a pv system and could reduce the demand for our solar modules andor lead to a reduction in the average selling price for pv modules ” 

  

developing solar power projects may require significant upfront investment prior to the signing of a power purchase agreement or an epc contract which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

our solar power project development cycles which span the time between the identification of land and the commercial operation of a pv power plant project vary substantially and can take many months or years to mature as a result of these long project cycles we may need to make significant upfront investments of resources including for example large transmission deposits or other payments which may be nonrefundable in advance of the signing of ppas and epc contracts and the receipt of any revenue much of which is not recognized for several additional months or years following contract signing our potential inability to enter into sales contracts with potential customers after making such upfront investments could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

our liquidity may be adversely affected to the extent the project sale market weakens and we are unable to sell our solar projects on pricing terms and timing commercially acceptable to us 

  

other risks 

  

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions and integration of these acquisitions may disrupt our business and management 

  

we have made several acquisitions in the last several years and in the future we may acquire additional companies project pipelines products or technologies or enter into joint ventures or other strategic initiatives we may not realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition and each acquisition has numerous risks these risks include the following 

  

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

mergers and acquisitions of companies are inherently risky and ultimately if we do not complete the integration of acquired businesses successfully and in a timely manner we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions to the extent anticipated which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

our future success depends on our ability to retain our key associates and to successfully integrate them into our management team 

  

we are dependent on the services of our executive officers and other members of our senior management team the loss of one or more of these key associates or any other member of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on us we may not be able to retain or replace these key associates and we may not have adequate succession plans in place several of our current key associates including our executive officers are subject to employment conditions or arrangements that contain postemployment noncompetition provisions however these arrangements permit the associates to terminate their employment with us upon little or no notice and the enforceability of the noncompetition provisions is uncertain 

  

if we are unable to attract train and retain key personnel our business may be materially and adversely affected 

  

our future success depends to a significant extent on our ability to attract train and retain management operations and technical personnel recruiting and retaining capable personnel particularly those with expertise in the pv industry and thinfilm technology are vital to our success there is substantial competition for qualified technical personnel and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain our technical personnel if we are unable to attract and retain qualified associates or otherwise experience labor disruptions our business may be materially and adversely affected 

  

we may be exposed to infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties which if determined adversely to us could cause us to pay significant damage awards or prohibit us from the manufacture and sale of our solar modules or the use of our technology 

  

  

our success depends largely on our ability to use and develop our technology and knowhow without infringing or misappropriating the intellectual property rights of third parties the validity and scope of claims relating to pv technology patents involve complex scientific legal and factual considerations and analysis and therefore may be highly uncertain we may be subject to litigation involving claims of patent infringement or violation of intellectual property rights of third parties the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits patent opposition proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings can be both costly and time consuming and may significantly divert the efforts and resources of our technical and management personnel an adverse determination in any such litigation or proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liability to third parties require us to seek licenses from third parties which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all or pay ongoing royalties require us to redesign our solar module or subject us to injunctions prohibiting the manufacture and sale of our solar modules or the use of our technologies protracted litigation could also result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of our solar modules until the resolution of such litigation 

  

currency translation and transaction risk may negatively affect our net sales cost of sales and gross margins and could result in exchange losses 

  

although our reporting currency is the us dollar we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most countries in which we operate as a result we are subject to currency translation and transaction risk for example 73 and 86 of our net sales were denominated in euro for the years ended december 31 2010 and december 26 2009  respectively and we expect a large percentage of our net sales to be outside the united states and denominated in foreign currencies in the future in addition our operating expenses for our manufacturing plants located outside the us currently germany and malaysia and vietnam and france in the future and our operations for our systems business in european countries and canada will be denominated in the local currency changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar could affect our net sales and cost of sales and could result in exchange gains or losses for example the weakening of the euro reduced our net sales by 494 million during fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009  in addition we incur currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from our reporting currency for example our european supply contracts specify fixed pricing in euros through 2012 and do not adjust for changes in the us dollar to euro exchange rate we cannot accurately predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations 

  

we could also expand our business into emerging markets many of which have an uncertain regulatory environment relating to currency policy conducting business in such emerging markets could cause our exposure to changes in exchange rates to increase 

  

our ability to hedge foreign currency exposure is dependent on our credit profile with the banks that are willing and able to do business with us deterioration in our credit position or a significant tightening of the credit market conditions could limit our ability to hedge our foreign currency exposure and therefore result in exchange losses 

  

the estate of john t walton and its affiliates have significant control over us and their interests may conflict with or differ from interests of other stockholders 

  

our largest stockholder the estate of john t walton and its affiliates including jcl holdings llc and jtw trust no 1 uad 91902 collectively the estate owned approximately 33 of our outstanding common stock at december 31 2010  as a result the estate has substantial influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of our directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions such as mergers tender offers and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets the interests of the estate could conflict with or differ from interests of other stockholders for example the concentration of ownership held by the estate could delay defer or prevent a change of control of our company or impede a merger takeover or other business combination which a majority of stockholders may view favorably 

  

if our goodwill or project assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 

  

we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements should we determine that our goodwill or project assets are impaired such a charge might have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 

  

as required by accounting rules we review our goodwill and project assets for impairment when events or changes in our business or circumstances indicate that their fair value might be less than their carrying value factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill might not be recoverable include a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant decline in projections of future cash flows and significantly slower growth rates in our industry we are also required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually we would write down project assets 

  

which are capitalized on the balance sheet for certain solar power projects should we determine that the project is not commercially viable 

  

unanticipated changes in our tax provisions the adoption of a new us tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 

  

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge for inventory services licenses funding and other items in intercompany transactions we are subject to potential tax examinations in these various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges crossjurisdictional transfer pricing or other tax positions and assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these examinations in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision in accordance with asc 740 income taxes  however there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these potential examinations and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of examinations could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows in addition our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure loss of our malaysian tax holiday changes in the mix of earnings in countries with tax holidays or differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process in addition recently announced proposals for new us tax legislation could have a material effect on the results of our operations if enacted 

  

our credit agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business 

  

we may be unable to respond to changes in business and economic conditions engage in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us and obtain additional financing if needed because our revolving credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank na as administrative agent and our malaysian facility agreement contain and any of our other future debt agreements may contain covenant restrictions that limit our ability to among other things 

  

   

   

   

   

   

under our revolving credit agreement and our malaysian facility agreement we are also subject to certain financial condition covenants our ability to comply with covenants under our credit agreements is dependent on our future performance which will be subject to many factors some of which are beyond our control including prevailing economic conditions in addition our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under these agreements and any of our other future debt agreements which if not cured or waived could permit the holders thereof to accelerate such debt if any of our debt is accelerated we may in the future not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt which could materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations

overview 

  

we manufacture and sell solar modules with an advanced thinfilm semiconductor technology and we design construct and sell photovoltaic pv solar power systems 

  

in furtherance of our goal of delivering the lowest cost of solar electricity and achieving price parity with conventional fossilfuel based peak electricity generation we are continually focused on reducing pv solar system costs in four primary areas module manufacturing balanceofsystem bos costs consisting of the costs of the components of a solar power system other than the solar modules such as inverters mounting hardware grid interconnection equipment wiring and other devices and installation labor costs project development costs and the cost of capital first with respect to our module manufacturing costs our advanced technology has allowed us to reduce our average module manufacturing costs to the lowest in the world based on publicly available information in 2010  our total average manufacturing costs were 077 per watt which we believe is significantly less than those of traditional crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers by continuing to improve conversion efficiency and production line throughput lower material costs and drive volume scale to further decrease overhead costs we believe that we can further reduce our manufacturing costs per watt and maintain our cost advantage over traditional crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers second by continuing to improve conversion efficiency leverage volume procurement around standardized hardware platforms and accelerate installation time we believe we can continue to make reductions in bos costs which represent over half of all of the costs associated with a typical utilityscale pv solar power system third with respect to project development costs we seek optimal site locations in an effort to minimize transmission and permitting costs and to accelerate lead time to electricity generation finally we believe that continuing to strengthen our financial position including our balance sheet and credit profile together with our increasing solar power system operating experience will enable us to continue to lower the cost of capital associated with our solar power systems thereby further enhancing the economic viability of our projects and lowering the cost of electricity generated by solar power systems that incorporate our modules and technology 

  

we believe that combining our reliable low cost module manufacturing capability with our systems business enables us to 

  

more rapidly reduce the price of solar electricity accelerate the adoption of our technology in large scale systems identify and break constraints to the successful migration to sustainable solar markets and further our mission to create enduring value by enabling a world powered by clean affordable solar electricity 

  

we operate our business in two segments our components segment designs manufactures and sells solar modules to solar project developers and system integrators through our systems segment we have the capability to provide a complete pv solar power system using our solar modules for utilityscale or large commercial systems providing a complete pv solar power system includes project development engineering procurement and construction epc operating and maintenance om services when applicable and project finance when required we view the sale of solar modules from the components segment as the core driver of our profitability return on net assets and cash throughput we view our systems segment as an enabler to drive module throughput for our components business with the objective of achieving breakeven results before income taxes for our systems segment see also note 23 segment and geographical information to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

  

historically our fiscal quarters ended on the saturday closest to the end of the applicable calendar quarter in july 2010 our board of directors approved a change in our fiscal year from a 52 or 53 week fiscal year to a calendar year this change to the calendar year cycle became effective as of the end of the 2010 fiscal year as a result our 2010 fiscal year which began on december 27 2009 ended on december 31 2010 instead of december 25 2010 in addition effective january 1 2011 our fiscal quarters will also coincide with calendar quarters all references to fiscal year 2010 relate to the 53 weeks ended december 31 2010  all references to fiscal year 2009 relate to the 52 weeks ended december 26 2009  and all references to fiscal year 2008 relate to the 52 weeks ended december 27 2008  

  

manufacturing capacity 

  

as of december 31 2010  we operated 24 production lines with an annual global manufacturing capacity of approximately 15 gw based on the average per line run rate for the fourth quarter of 2010 at our existing plants at our manufacturing plants in perrysburg ohio frankfurtoder germany and kulim malaysia we expect to increase our manufacturing capacity to 46 production lines including our previously announced 4line plants in vietnam and the united states by the end of 2012 with an annual global manufacturing capacity of approximately 29 gw based on the average per line run rate for the fourth quarter of 2010 at our existing plants 

  

market overview 

  

in addressing a growing global demand for pv solar electricity we target markets with varying approaches depending on the underlying economics market requirements and distribution channels in subsidized fit markets such as germany we have historically sold most of our solar modules to solar project developers system integrators and independent power producers in other markets such as the united states the demand for solar has been primarily driven by state level renewable portfolio standards requiring regulated utilities to supply a portion of their total electricity from renewable energy sources such as solar power to meet the needs of these markets and enable bos cost reductions we have developed a fully integrated systems business that can provide a lowcost turnkey utilityscale pv system solution for system owners and low cost electricity to utility endusers our fully integrated systems business has enabled us to increase module throughput drive cost reduction across the value chain identify and break constraints to sustainable markets and to deliver the most compelling solutions to our customers and endusers with our fully integrated systems business we believe we are in a position to expand our business in transition markets and eventually economically sustainable markets in which subsidies or incentives are minimal which are expected to develop in areas with abundant solar resources and sizable electricity demand we are committed to continually lowering the cost of solar electricity and in the long term we plan to compete on an economic basis with conventional fossil fuel based peaking power generation 

  

net sales for the year ended december 31 2010 were primarily driven by revenue recognition on several utility scale solar power projects in north america and strong european installations primarily in germany france and italy net sales from german customers resulted from a combination of demand in advance of further german fit reductions taking effect on july 1 2010 october 1 2010 and at the beginning of 2011 customer participation in our rebate program and improving project finance and overall corporate finance conditions 

  

in light of strong 2010 solar growth the major european governments are currently seeking to balance subsidy costs with their commitment to the eu directives goal of a 20 share of energy from renewable sources in the eu by 2020 governments in germany france and italy are in the process of evaluating additional changes to their fit structures the german government is expected to adopt a partial acceleration of the january 2012 fit digression to mid2011 in germany which accounted for approximately 46 of our 2010 net sales a midyear fit decrease as was effected in 2010 if enacted could contribute to a shortterm pullin of demand but carries the potential for tighter economics in the second half of 2011 as the solar industry adjusts 

  

to lower fit levels which may negatively affect longterm demand and price levels for pv products in germany see item 1 “business  support programs” for a summary of recent developments in the major government subsidy programs in our core and target markets in light of continually evolving fit structures in our core european markets it is uncertain whether there will be sufficient market demand to absorb industrywide module supply without significant inventory buildup or price reductions we plan to mitigate this uncertainty in part by continuing to use our north american utilityscale systems pipeline as a buffer against demand fluctuations in europe and elsewhere 

  

during 2010 we continued to expand into certain key transition markets such as the united states within which affordable solar electricity solutions could be developed and which could ultimately evolve into economically sustainable markets in january 2010 we completed the acquisition of certain assets from edison mission groups solar project development pipeline consisting of utilityscale solar projects located primarily on private land in california and the southwestern united states in july 2010 we completed the acquisition of nextlight renewable power llc another leading developer of utilityscale solar projects in the southwestern united states this transaction expanded our pipeline of solar power projects in the southwestern united states and supports our expansion in the us utilityscale market for instance in the fourth quarter of 2010 we entered into an agreement to sell to nrg energy inc the 290 mw ac agua caliente solar project which was part of the next light pipeline of projects upon its completion agua caliente is expected to be the largest operational pv solar plant in the world 

  

in the pv module segment we continue to face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules and other types of solar modules and pv systems solar module manufacturers compete with one another in several product performance attributes including reliability and module cost per watt and with respect to solar power systems return on equity roe and levelized cost of electricity lcoe meaning the net present value of total life cycle costs of the solar power project divided by the quantity of energy which is expected to be produced over the systems life the ability to expand manufacturing capacity quickly is another source of differentiation among solar module manufacturers and certain of our competitors may have a faster response time to capacity expansion than we do andor an ability to expand capacity in finer increments than we can we are the lowest cost pv module manufacturer in the solar industry based on publicly available information as evidenced by the further reduction in our average manufacturing cost per watt from 087 during 2009 to 077 during 2010  this cost advantage is reflected in the price at which we sell our modules or fully integrated systems and enables our systems to compete favorably in respect of their roe or lcoe our cost competitiveness is based in large part on our proprietary technology which enables conversion efficiency improvements and enables us to produce a module in less than 25 hours using a continuous and highly automated industrial manufacturing process as opposed to a batch process our scale and our operational excellence in addition our modules use approximately 12 of the amount of semiconductor material that is used to manufacture traditional crystalline silicon solar modules the cost of polysilicon is a significant driver of the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules the timing and rate of change in the cost of silicon feedstock could lead to changes in solar module pricing levels although we are not a crystalline silicon module manufacturer we estimate based on industry research and public disclosures of our competitors that a 10 per kg increase or decrease in the price of polysilicon could increase or decrease respectively our competitors manufacturing cost per watt by approximately 006 to 007 over time given the lower conversion efficiency of our modules compared to crystalline silicon modules there may be higher bos costs associated with systems using our modules thus to compete effectively on the basis of lcoe our modules may need to maintain a certain cost advantage per watt compared to crystalline siliconbased modules during 2010  we reduced our manufacturing cost per watt by 11 from our cost per watt in 2009 and continued to reduce bos costs associated with systems using our modules 

  

while our modules currently enjoy competitive advantages in these product performance attributes there can be no guarantee that these advantages will continue to exist in the future to the same extent or at all any declines in the competitiveness of our products could result in margin compression a decline in the average selling prices of our solar modules erosion in our market share for modules a decrease in the rate of revenue growth andor a decline in overall revenues we have taken and continue to take several actions to mitigate the potential impact resulting from competitive pressures including adjusting our pricing policies as necessary in core market segments to drive module volumes continuously making progress along our cost reduction roadmap and focusing our research and development on increasing the conversion efficiency of our solar modules 

  

as we expand our systems business into transition and sustainable markets we can offer value beyond the pv module reduce our exposure to moduleonly competition and provide comprehensive utilityscale pv systems solutions that significantly reduce solar electricity costs thus our systems business allows us to play a more active role than many of our competitors in managing the demand for and manufacturing throughput of our solar modules finally we seek to form and develop strong partner relationships with our customers and continue to develop our range of offerings including epc capabilities and om services in order to enhance the competitiveness of systems using our solar modules 

  

  

financial operations overview 

  

  

the following describes certain line items in our statement of operations and some of the factors that affect our operating results 

  

net sales 

  

components business 

  

currently the majority of our net sales are generated from the sale of solar modules we price and sell our solar modules per watt of power during 2010  we sold the majority of our solar modules to solar power system project developers system integrators and operators headquartered in germany italy france spain and the united states which either resell our solar modules to endusers or integrate them into power plants that they own operate or sell 

  

as of december 31 2010  we had supply contracts for the sale of solar modules expiring at the end of 2012 with fourteen solar power system project developers and system integrators headquartered within the european union these contracts account for a significant portion of our planned production over the period from 2011 through 2012 and therefore will significantly affect our overall financial performance we have the right to terminate certain supply contracts upon 12 months notice and the payment of a termination fee if we determine that certain material adverse changes have occurred in addition our customers are entitled to certain remedies in the event of missed deliveries of kilowatt volume these delivery commitments are established through rolling four quarter forecasts that are agreed to with each of the customers within the parameters established in the supply contracts and define the specific quantities to be purchased on a quarterly basis and the schedules of the individual shipments to be made to the customers in the case of a late delivery certain of our customers are entitled to a maximum charge representing a percentage of the delinquent revenue if we do not meet our annual minimum volume shipments our customers also have the right to terminate these contracts on a prospective basis 

  

our sales prices under the supply contracts are denominated in euro exposing us to risks from currency exchange rate fluctuations during the year ended december 31 2010  73 of our sales were denominated in euro and were subject to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and us dollar 

  

in the past we have amended pricing and other terms in our supply contracts on a prospective basis in order to remain competitive and we may decide in the future to further amend these contracts in order to address the highly competitive environment for solar modules during the year ended december 26 2009 we amended our supply contracts with certain of our customers to implement a program which provided a price rebate to these customers for solar modules purchased from us the intent of this program was to enable our customers to successfully compete in our core german market and to adjust for eligible customers the sales price which was documented in framework agreements entered into several years ago in light of market conditions the rebate program is offered for a defined period during which customers may apply and claim such rebate the most recent rebate offering for all solar modules sold through november 30 2010 will terminate on february 28 2011 beginning march 1 2011 we will offer customers a modified rebate program including applicability to certain european geographic areas in addition to germany 

  

the rebate amounts continue to be established so as to enable the sellthrough of our products at competitive prices the rebate program applies a specified rebate rate to solar modules sold for solar power projects in certain geographic areas customers need to meet certain requirements in order to be eligible for and benefit from this program as of december 31 2010 and december 26 2009  we have experienced approximately 81 and 100 participation in this program by eligible customers respectively the lower customer participation at december 31 2010 was primarily due to the expiration of the current rebate offering period in february 2011 

  

we account for these rebates as a reduction to the selling price of our solar modules and therefore as a reduction in revenue at the time of sale and recognize a contraasset within accounts receivable trade net no rebates granted under this program can be claimed for cash instead rebates may only be applied to reduce outstanding accounts receivable balances during 2010 we extended rebates to customers in the amount of €921 million  1234 million at the average exchange rate of 134 €100 at december 31 2010  we had €196 million  261 million at the balance sheet close rate on december 31 2010 of 133 €100 of rebate claims accrued which reduced our accounts receivable accordingly during the year ended december 26 2009  we extended rebates to customers in the amount of €871 million  1289 million at an average exchange rate of 148 €100 at december 26 2009  we had €543 million  722 million at the balance sheet close rate on december 31 2010 of 133 €100 of rebate claims accrued which reduced our accounts receivable accordingly 

  

we also enter into onetime module sales agreements with customers for specific projects 

  

under our customer contracts we transfer title and risk of loss to the customer and recognize revenue upon shipment our 

  

customers do not have extended payment terms or rights of return under these contracts 

  

during 2010  the principal customers of our components business were edf en development  juwi solar gmbh  and phoenix solar ag  during 2010  each of these three customers individually accounted for between 10 and 20 of our components segment’s net sales all of our other customers individually accounted for less than 10 of our net sales during 2010  

  

systems business 

  

through our fully integrated systems business we provide a complete solar power system solution using our solar modules which may include project development epc services om services when applicable and project finance when required in july 2010 we completed the acquisition of nextlight renewable power llc a leading developer of utilityscale solar projects in the southwestern united states this transaction expanded our pipeline of solar power projects in the southwestern united states and supports our expansion in the us utilityscale power market 

  

net sales from our systems segment may include the following types of transactions 



  

net sales from our systems segment are impacted by numerous factors including the magnitude and effectiveness of renewable portfolio standards economic incentives such as european fits the us federal investment tax credit grants in lieu of tax credits under section 1603 of the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 us department of energy loan guarantees or accelerated depreciation and other pv system demand drivers 

net sales from our systems business during 2010 resulted primarily from revenue recognition for utility scale solar power projects in north america and europe during 2009 net sales from our systems business resulted primarily from the sale of two utilityscale solar power systems in the fourth fiscal quarter to utilities in the united states and canada

cost of sales 

  

  

components business 

  

our cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials and components for manufacturing solar modules such as tempered back glass transparent conductive oxide coated front glass cadmium telluride laminate connector assemblies laminate edge seal and other items our cost of sales also includes direct labor for the manufacturing of solar modules and manufacturing overhead such as engineering equipment maintenance environmental health and safety quality and production control and procurement costs cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing plant and equipment and facilityrelated expenses in addition we accrue warranty and solar module collection and recycling costs to our cost of sales 

  

we implemented a program in 2005 to collect and recycle our solar modules after their use under our solar module collection and recycling program we enter into an agreement with the endusers of the solar power systems that use our solar modules in the agreement we commit at our expense to collect the solar modules from the installation site at the end of their useful life and transport them to a processing center where the solar module materials and components will be either refurbished and resold as used solar modules or recycled to recover some of the raw materials in return the owner agrees not to dispose of the solar modules except through our module collection and recycling program or any other program that we might approve of the owner is also responsible for disassembling the solar modules and packaging them in containers that we provide at the time we sell a solar module we record an expense in cost of sales equal to the fair value of the estimated future module collection and recycling obligation we subsequently record accretion expense on this future obligation which we classify within selling general and administrative expense 

  

overall we expect our cost of sales per watt to continue to decrease over the next several years due to an increase in sellable watts per solar module an increase in unit output per production line continued geographic expansion into lowercost manufacturing regions and more efficient absorption of fixed costs driven by economies of scale 

  

systems business 

  

within our systems business projectrelated costs include standard epc costs consisting primarily of bos costs for inverters electrical and mounting hardware project management and engineering costs and installation labor costs site specific costs and development costs including transmission upgrade costs interconnection fees and permitting costs as further described in note 23 segment and geographical information to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k at the time when the revenue recognition criteria are met we include the sale of our solar modules manufactured by our components business and used by our systems business as net sales of our components business therefore the related cost of sales are also included within our components business at that time 

  

deferred project costs represent i costs that we capitalize for arrangements that we account for as real estate transactions after we have entered into a definitive sales arrangement but before we have met the criteria to recognize the sale as revenue ii recoverable precontract costs that we capitalize for arrangements accounted for as long term construction contracts prior to entering into a definitive sales agreement or iii costs that we capitalize for arrangements accounted for as long term construction contracts after we have signed a definitive sales agreement but before the revenue recognition criteria have been met deferred project costs capitalized on our balance sheet at december 31 2010 and december 26 2009 were 144 million and 367 million  respectively 

  

gross profit 

  

gross profit is affected by numerous factors including our module average selling prices foreign exchange rates the existence and effectiveness of subsidies and other economic incentives market mix our manufacturing costs bos costs project development costs the effective utilization of our production facilities and the ramp of production on new plants due to a reduced ability to absorb fixed costs until full production volumes are reached gross profit is also subject to competitive pressures and we have in the past and may in the future decide to amend our supply contracts which specify our sales price per watt gross profit margin is also affected by the mix of net sales generated by our components and systems businesses our systems business generally operates at a lower gross profit margin due to the passthrough nature of certain bos components procured from third parties gross profit for our systems business excludes the sales and cost of sales for solar modules which we include in the gross profit of our components business 

  

research and development 

  

research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and personnelrelated costs the cost of products materials and outside services used in our process and product research and development activities we acquire equipment for general use 

  

in further process developments and record the depreciation of this equipment as research and development expense we expect our research and development expense to increase in absolute terms in the future as we increase personnel and research and development activity over time we expect research and development expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as a result of economies of scale currently the majority of our research and development expenses are attributable to our components segment 

  

we maintain a number of programs and activities to improve our technology and processes in order to enhance the performance and reduce the costs of our solar modules and pv systems using our modules we report our research and development expense net of grant funding during the years ended december 31 2010 and december 26 2009  we did not receive any grant funding we received 09 million of grant funding during the year ended december 27 2008 that we applied towards our research and development programs 

  

selling general and administrative 

  

selling general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated costs professional fees insurance costs travel expenses and other selling expenses we expect these expenses to increase in the near term both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales in order to support the growth of our business as we expand our sales and marketing efforts improve our information processes and systems and implement the financial reporting compliance and other infrastructure required for an expanding public company over time we expect selling general and administrative expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as our net sales and our total watts produced increase 

  

our systems business has certain of its own dedicated administrative key functions such as accounting legal finance project finance human resources procurement and marketing costs for such functions are recorded and included within selling general and administrative costs for our systems segment our corporate key functions consist primarily of companywide corporate tax corporate treasury corporate accountingfinance corporate legal investor relations corporate communications and executive management functions currently our components business benefits the most from these functions and therefore we have allocated these costs to this segment as part of selling general and administrative costs 

  

production startup 

  

production startup expense consists primarily of salaries and personnelrelated costs and the cost of operating a production line before it has been qualified for full production including the cost of raw materials for solar modules run through the production line during the qualification phase it also includes all expenses related to the selection of a new site and the related legal and regulatory costs and the costs to maintain our plant replication program to the extent we cannot capitalize these expenditures we incurred production startup expense of 325 million during the year ended december 27 2008 in connection with the planning and preparation of our plants at the malaysian manufacturing center we incurred production startup expense of 139 million during the year ended december 26 2009 related to plant four of our malaysian manufacturing center and our ohio plant expansion production startup expense for the year ended december 31 2010 was 194 million and related to our eightline malaysian fourline german oneline perrysburg ohio and twoline blanquefort france manufacturing expansions including legal regulatory and personnel costs in general we expect production startup expense per production line to be higher when we build an entirely new manufacturing facility compared with the addition of new production lines at an existing manufacturing facility primarily due to the additional infrastructure investment required when building an entirely new facility over time we expect production startup expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as a result of economies of scale production startup expense is attributable to our components segment 

  

foreign currency loss gain 

  

foreign currency loss gain consists of losses and gains resulting from holding assets and liabilities and conducting transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies 

  

interest income 

  

interest income is earned on our cash cash equivalents marketable securities and restricted cash and investments interest income also includes interest received from notes receivable and interest collected for late customer payments 

  

interest expense net 

  

interest expense net of amounts capitalized is incurred on various debt financings we capitalize interest expense into our property plant and equipment project assets and deferred project costs 

  

  

income tax expense 

  

income taxes are imposed on our income by taxing authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate principally the united states germany and malaysia the statutory federal corporate income tax rate in the united states is 350  while the tax rates in germany and malaysia are approximately 286 and 250  respectively in malaysia we have been granted a longterm tax holiday scheduled to expire in 2027 pursuant to which substantially all of our income earned in malaysia is exempt from income tax 

  

critical accounting estimates 

  

in preparing our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap we make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts of reported assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities in our financial statements and the related notes thereto some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in the selection of the appropriate assumptions for making these estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty we base our judgments and estimates on our historical experience our forecasts and other available information as appropriate our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2010 included in this annual report on form 10k 

  

our critical accounting estimates which require the most significant management estimates and judgment in determining amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k are as follows 

  

accrued solar module collection and recycling liability at the time of sale we recognize an expense for the estimated fair value of our future obligation for collecting and recycling the solar modules that we have sold when they have reached the end of their useful lives we base our estimate of the fair value of our collection and recycling obligations on the present value of the expected future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules which includes the cost of packaging the solar modules for transport the cost of freight from the solar module installation sites to a recycling center the material labor and capital costs of the recycling process and an estimated thirdparty profit margin and return on risk for collection and recycling services we base this estimate on our experience collecting and recycling our solar modules and on our expectations about future developments in recycling technologies and processes about economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled and about the timing of when our solar modules will be returned for recycling in the periods between the time of our sales and our settlement of the collection and recycling obligations we accrete the carrying amount of the associated liability by applying the discount rate used for its initial measurement at december 31 2010  our estimate of the fair value of our liability for collecting and recycling solar modules was 1330 million  a 10 decrease in our estimate of the future cost of collecting and recycling a solar module would reduce this estimated liability by 136 million to 1194 million a 10 increase in our estimate of the future cost of collecting and recycling a solar module would increase this estimated liability by 136 million to 1466 million 

  

product warranties we provide a limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for five years following delivery to the owners of our solar modules we also warrant to the owners of our solar modules that solar modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 90 of their power output rating during the first 10 years following their installation and at least 80 of their power output rating during the following 15 years in resolving claims under both the defects and power output warranties we have the option of either repairing or replacing the covered solar module or under the power output warranty providing additional solar modules to remedy the power shortfall our warranties are automatically transferred from the original purchasers of our solar modules to subsequent purchasers we accrue warranty costs when we recognize sales using amounts estimated based on our historical experience with warranty claims our monitoring of field installation sites and inhouse testing 

  

accounting for income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the united states and its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining our provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit we regularly assess the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and subsequent years examinations and we record tax liabilities as appropriate 

we establish liabilities for potential additional taxes that may arise out of tax audits in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification topic asc 740 income taxes  once established we adjust the liabilities when additional information 

  

becomes available or when an event occurs requiring an adjustment significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the actual cost of a legal claim tax assessment or regulatory fine or penalty may ultimately be materially different from our recorded liabilities if any 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements we calculate our income tax expense based on our interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business this requires us to estimate our current tax obligations and the realizability of uncertain tax positions and to assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities the net current amount of which we show as a component of current assets or current liabilities and the net noncurrent amount of which we show as other assets or other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 

  

we must also assess the likelihood that each of our deferred tax assets will be realized to the extent we believe that realization of any of our deferred tax assets is not more likely than not we establish a valuation allowance when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a reporting period we generally record a corresponding tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations conversely to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed which generally reduces our overall income tax expense 

  

we also consider the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and determine whether such amounts are indefinitely reinvested outside the united states we have concluded that except for the decision to strategically repatriate approximately 300 million during 2010 all such accumulated earnings are currently indefinitely reinvested accordingly no additional taxes have been accrued that might be incurred if such amounts were repatriated to the united states if our intention to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries changes additional taxes may be required to be accrued see note 19 income taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

  

goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of the acquired businesses over the estimated fair value assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed we do not amortize goodwill but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter and if necessary we would record any impairment in accordance with asc 350 intangibles  goodwill and other we will perform an impairment review between scheduled annual tests if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill is less than its carrying value in the process of our annual impairment review we primarily use the income approach of valuation which includes the discounted cash flow method and the market approach of valuation which considers values of comparable businesses to estimate the fair value of our reporting units significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results and the discount rates that we used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation and in the selection of comparable businesses that we used in the market approach 

  

we reported 4333 million of goodwill at december 31 2010  which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net tangible and intangible assets that we acquired from turner renewable energy llc optisolar inc and nextlight renewable power llc asc 350 requires us to test goodwill for impairment at least annually or sooner if facts or circumstances between scheduled annual tests indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill might be less than its carrying value currently our operating segments and reporting units are identical we determine the fair value for our reporting units referring to the price that would be received to sell the unit as whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date for the assessment of goodwill related to our systems business we believe that a typical market participant for the sale of our systems reporting unit would be a solar module manufacturer seeking to acquire a systems business with a large pipeline of utilityscale solar power plant projects with the intent that these projects would provide a captive outlet for additional future solar module production therefore we model the systems reporting units future performance for purposes of applying the income method of fair value measurement to include some of the profitability associated with the solar module element of the solar power plants that it builds and sells 

  

we performed our goodwill impairment test in the fourth fiscal quarter of the years ended december 31 2010 and december 26 2009 and determined that the fair value of each of our individual reporting units substantially exceeded its carrying value therefore we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired

fiscal years ended december 31 2010 and december 26 2009 

  

net sales 



  

the increase in net sales was primarily driven by strong demand from german customers in advance of further fit reductions an increase in revenue from our systems business and an increase in production volume resulting in a 28 increase in megawatts sold during 2010 compared with 2009 these increases were partially offset by a decrease in our module average selling price the increase in megawatts sold was attributable to the full production ramp of our fourplant malaysian manufacturing center in 2009 full production ramp of our perrysburg ohio expansion in 2010 continued improvements to our manufacturing process and line throughput and growth in our systems business in addition we increased the average conversion efficiency of our modules by approximately 3 during 2010 compared with 2009 our module average selling price excluding the impact of systems segment breakeven reporting decreased by approximately 10 during 2010 compared with 2009 the decline in our module average selling price was attributable to the following a 5 decrease due to market price declines driven by fit reductions in europe a 5 decrease due to annual contractual agreements and a 2 decrease due to the weakening of the euro against the us dollar exchange rate partially offset by a 2 increase due to a shift in customer mix revenue recognized by our systems business during 2010 was 3784 million and resulted primarily from the sale of utilityscale solar power systems in europe and north america and from percentageofcompletion revenue recognition for utilityscale solar power systems in north america during 2010 and 2009 46 and 65 respectively of our net sales resulted from solar module sales to customers headquartered in germany 

  

cost of sales 



  

the increase in cost of sales was due to higher sales volumes including an increase in the completion and sale of utilityscale solar power projects by our systems business the full production ramp of our first four plants at our malaysian manufacturing center in 2009 and the full production ramp of our perrysburg ohio expansion in 2010 the increased production and sales volumes in our components business and increased volume sold through our systems business had the following effects a 2254 million increase in direct material expense a 792 million increase in manufacturing overhead costs an 180 million increase in sales freight a 182 million increase in warranty expense and a 163 million net increase in other costs 

  

the 792 million increase in manufacturing overhead costs for 2010 was due to a 329 million increase in salaries and 

  

personnelrelated expenses including a 108 million increase in sharebased compensation expense a 170 million increase in depreciation and equipment expenses a 20 million increase in facility related expenses and a 273 million increase in incremental systems costs each of these manufacturing overhead cost increases primarily resulted from increased production capacity resulting from the full ramp of our malaysian manufacturing center expansion of our perrysburg ohio plant and ramp of our systems business 

  

the net increase in other costs for 2010 includes 237 million related to an increase in estimated expenses for certain module replacement efforts beyond normal warranty during the period from june 2008 to june 2009 a manufacturing excursion occurred affecting less than 4 of the total product manufactured within the period the excursion could result in possible premature power loss in the affected modules the root cause was identified and subsequently mitigated in june 2009 ongoing testing confirms that the corrective actions taken are effective we have been working directly with impacted customers to replace the affected modules and these efforts are well underway and in some cases complete some of these efforts go beyond our normal warranty coverage accordingly we accrued additional expenses of 308 million in 2010 and 379 million in totaltodate to cover the replacement of the anticipated affected module population in the field such amounts include 85 million in expenses accrued during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010 reflecting updated best estimates of the total replacement costs based on our field data and execution to date of the module replacement program 

  

our average manufacturing cost per watt declined by 010 per watt or 11  from 087 in 2009 to 077 in 2010 and included 002 of noncash stock based compensation 

  

gross profit 



  

gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased by 44 percentage points in 2010 compared with 2009 this decrease was attributable to the following a 40 percentage point reduction due to a decline in our module average selling prices a 39 percentage point reduction due to segment mix between our components and systems businesses a 11 percentage point reduction relating to the manufacturing excursion discussed above under cost of sales and a 06 percentage point reduction due to the weakening of the euro against the us dollar exchange rate partially offset by a 52 percentage point margin improvement attributable to continued manufacturing scale and reductions in our manufacturing cost per watt we expect that gross profit will be impacted in future periods by the volatility of the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro and product mix between our components and systems businesses 

  

research and development 



  

the increase in research and development expense was due to a 106 million increase in personnelrelated expenses including a 22 million increase in sharebased compensation expense resulting from increased headcount devoted to working on various projects to increase the efficiency of our modules at converting sunlight into electricity and a 96 million increase in depreciation testing and qualification material costs partially offset by a 36 million decrease in other expenses during 2010 we continued the development of solar modules with increased efficiencies at converting sunlight into electricity and increased the conversion efficiency of our modules by approximately 3 compared with 2009 

  

selling general and administrative 



  

the increase in selling general and administrative expense was due to a 27 million increase in salaries and personnelrelated 

  

expenses due to growth after giving effect to a 25 million decrease in sharebased compensation expense due to onetime charges associated with our executive management team in 2009 a 176 million increase in expenses related to our systems business a 148 million increase in facility and depreciation expenses a 63 million increase in professional fees and expenses associated with the implementation of a new erp system and a 74 million increase in other expenses selling general and administrative expense also included 53 million of other operating expenses related to impairment charges of certain project assets 

  

production startup 



  

during 2010  we incurred 194 million of production startup expenses for our eightline malaysian fourline german oneline perrysburg ohio and twoline blanquefort france manufacturing expansions including legal regulatory and personnel costs compared with 139 million of production startup expenses for our malaysian and perrysburg ohio manufacturing expansions during 2009  production startup expenses are composed of the cost of labor and material and depreciation expense to run and qualify the production lines related facility expenses management of our replication process and legal and regulatory costs 

  

foreign currency loss gain 



  

foreign exchange gain decreased during 2010 compared with 2009 due to a increase in our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and volatility of the us dollar relative to other currencies in particular the euro 

  

interest income 



  

interest income increased during 2010 compared with 2009 primarily as a result of an increase in the average interest bearing cash and investment balances year over year and interest earned from notes receivable 

  

interest expense net 



  

interest expense net of amounts capitalized decreased during 2010 compared with 2009  primarily as a result of higher amounts of interest expense capitalized during 2010  in addition interest expense net for 2009 included a 24 million expense related to the termination of the interest rate swaps for our german debt facility we fully repaid this facility on june 30 2009 

  

other income expense net 



  

other income during 2010 primarily resulted from a realized gain associated with the sale of our equity investment in a related party partially offset by other expenses other expense during 2009 primarily resulted from nonrecurring expenses associated with our credit default swaps 

  

  

income tax expense 



  

income tax expense increased by 517 million during 2010 compared with 2009  of this increase 138 million related to a onetime noncash tax charge in connection with our decision to repatriate approximately 300 million of earnings from certain of our foreign subsidiaries prior to january 1 2011 when recently enacted us international tax legislation became effective in addition 115 million related to a onetime tax benefit recorded in 2009 in connection with the pullforward of the malaysian tax holiday from 2008 substantially all of the remainder of the increase related to a 758 million increase in pretax income and a greater percentage of profits earned in higher tax jurisdictions see note 19 income taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

  

fiscal years ended december 26 2009 and december 27 2008 

  

net sales 



  

the increase in our net sales was primarily driven by price elasticity that resulted in strong demand for our solar modules as prices declined resulting in a 114 increase in the megawatt volume of solar modules sold during 2009 compared with 2008 and from an increase in business activity associated with our systems segment business partially offset by a decrease in our module average selling price revenue recognized for our systems business during 2009 was 1150 million and resulted primarily from the sale of two utility scale solar power systems to utilities in the united states and canada the increase in megawatt volume of solar modules sold was attributable to the full production ramp of all four plants at our malaysian manufacturing center continued improvements to our manufacturing process and the growth in our systems business in addition we increased the average conversion efficiency by approximately 3 during 2009 compared with 2008 our average selling price decreased by approximately 25 during 2009 compared with 2008 approximately 20 of the decline in our average selling price was primarily due to competitive pressure including the commencement of a customer rebate program in the third quarter of 2009 additionally our average selling price was adversely impacted by approximately 4 due to a decrease in the foreign exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro and by approximately 1 due to a shift in customer mix during 2009 and 2008 65 and 74 respectively of our net sales resulted from sales of solar modules to customers headquartered in germany 

  

cost of sales 



  

the increase in our cost of sales was due to higher production and sales volumes which resulted from the commencement of production at all of our four plants at our malaysian manufacturing center production ramp of our perrysburg ohio expansion and an increase in business activity associated with our systems segment business the increased production and sales volumes in our components business and increased volume sold through our systems business had the following effects a 2787 million increase in direct material expense including an 82 million amortization of project assets acquired through our optisolar acquisition a 410 million increase in warranty expense and accruals for the estimated future costs associated with the collection and recycling of our solar modules due to increased sales a 138 million increase in sales freight and other costs and a 1202 million increase in manufacturing overhead costs the increase in manufacturing overhead costs was due to a 353 million increase in salaries and personnel related expenses including a 49 million increase in sharebased compensation expense a 329 million increase in facility and related expenses and a 520 million increase in depreciation expense each of these manufacturing overhead cost increases primarily resulted from increased infrastructure associated with the build out of our malaysian manufacturing center and startup of our systems business our average manufacturing cost per watt declined by 021 per watt or 19 from 108 in 2008 to 087 in 2009 and included 001 of ramp penalty associated with the ramp and qualification of our malaysian and perrysburg manufacturing facilities and 001 of noncash stock based compensation 

  

  

gross profit 



  

gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased by 38 percentage points in 2009 compared with 2008 due to a decline in our average selling prices by approximately 21 percentage points partially offset by continued manufacturing cost per watt reduction of 194 percentage points the decline in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro adversely impacted our gross profit by 22 percentage points we expect that gross profit will be impacted in future periods by the volatility of the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro and product mix between our components and systems businesses

the increase in our research and development expense was due to a 142 million increase in personnel related expense including a 23 million increase in sharebased compensation expense resulting from increased headcount in addition testing and qualification material costs increased by 180 million consulting and other expenses increased by 115 million and grants received an offset to our research and development expenses decreased by 09 million during 2009 compared with 2008 during fiscal 2009 we continued the development of solar modules with increased efficiencies at converting sunlight into electricity and we increased the conversion efficiency of our modules by approximately 3 in comparison to fiscal 2008 

  

selling general and administrative 



  

the increase in selling general and administrative expense was due to a 660 million increase in salaries and personnelrelated expenses including a 230 million increase in sharebased compensation expense of which 157 million were onetime charges associated with our executive management team in addition legal and professional service fees increased by 133 million and other expenses increased by 196 million and included 69 million of onetime charges of which 55 million of costs related to the acquisition integration and operation of the solar power project development business of optisolar which we acquired on april 3 2009 

  

production startup 



  

during 2009 we incurred 139 million of production startup expenses for our malaysian and perrysburg manufacturing expansions including legal regulatory and personnel costs compared with 325 million of production startup expenses for our malaysian manufacturing expansion during 2008 production startup expenses are composed of the cost of labor and material and depreciation expense to run and qualify the production lines related facility expenses management of our replication process and legal and regulatory costs 

  

foreign currency gain 

  



  

foreign currency gain decreased primarily due to a decrease in our net foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 

  

interest income 



  

interest income decreased primarily due to a substantial decline in interest rates 

  

interest expense net 



  

interest expense net of amounts capitalized increased primarily due to lower amounts of interest expense capitalized during 2009 in addition interest expense net for 2009 includes a 24 million expense related to the termination of the interest rate swaps for our german debt facility we fully repaid this facility on june 30 2009 

  

other expense net 



  

other expense net increased primarily due to expenses associated with our credit default swaps which expired in the second quarter of 2009 

  

income tax expense 



  

income tax expense decreased primarily due to the effect of our tax holiday in malaysia during 2009 a significant amount of our pretax income was generated in malaysia where we have a 165 year tax holiday in addition we recognized an 115 million tax benefit during 2009 related to the reversal of 2008 malaysian tax due to the pullforward of the tax holiday to 2008 which was granted in 2009 see note 19 income taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for more information 

  

business segment review 

  



  

our chief operating decision maker consisting of senior executive staff views the sale of solar modules from the components segment as the core driver of our profitability return on net assets and cash throughput and as a result we view our systems segment as an enabler to drive module throughput therefore we operate our systems segment with the objective to achieve breakeven results before income taxes we include the sale of our solar modules manufactured by the components segment and installed in projects sold by our systems segment in “net sales” of our components business see note 23 segment and geographical information to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for more information 

  

components segment 

  



  

components segment net sales increased by 11 during 2010 compared with 2009  primarily due to strong demand from german customers in advance of further fit reductions increased net sales attributable to modules installed in utilityscale solar power systems for which we have recognized revenue an increase in production volume resulting from our manufacturing expansions in kulim malaysia and perrysburg ohio and continued improvements to our manufacturing process and line throughput partially offset by a decrease in our module average selling price our module average selling price excluding the impact of systems segment breakeven reporting decreased by approximately 10 during 2010 compared with 2009  the decline in our module average selling price was attributable to the following a 5 decrease due to market price declines driven by fit reductions in europe a 5 decrease due to annual contractual agreements and a 2 decrease due to the weakening of the euro against the us dollar exchange rate partially offset by a 2 increase due to a shift in customer mix the effect of our segment reporting adjustments to achieve breakeven results before income taxes for our systems segment decreased the module average selling price by an additional 3 

  

components segment net sales increased by 64 during 2009 compared with 2008  primarily driven by price elasticity that resulted in strong demand for our solar modules as prices declined increased net sales attributable to modules installed in utilityscale solar power systems for which we have recognized revenue an increase in production volume as a result of bringing additional manufacturing lines into full production and continued improvements to our manufacturing process 

  

components segment cost of sales increased by 16 during 2010 compared with 2009  and by 73 during 2009 compared with 2008  primarily due to higher production and sales volumes 

  

components segment profit increased by 11 during 2010 compared with 2009  and by 48 during 2009 compared with 2008 in each case primarily due to an increase in the mw volume of solar modules sold reductions in our manufacturing cost per watt and by increased throughput partially offset by a decline in our module average selling price and certain onetime expenses 

  

systems segment 

  



  

systems segment net sales increased from 1008 million during 2009 to 3784 million during 2010  reflecting primarily the completion and sale of utilityscale solar power systems in europe and north america and from percentageofcompletion revenue recognition for inprogress utilityscale solar power systems in north america 

  

systems segment net sales increased from 505 million during 2008 to 1008 million during 2009  reflecting primarily the sale of or percentageofcompletion recognition for various utilityscale solar power systems in north america and europe 

  

systems segment cost of sales increased from 936 million in 2009 to 3001 million in 2010  and from 323 million in 2008 to 936 million in 2009  primarily due to the increase in construction activities for various utilityscale solar power projects in europe and north america during these periods as described above under item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  financial operations overview  cost of sales  systems business 

  

systems segment profit was zero for 2010  2009  and 2008  as noted above we operate our systems segment with the objective to achieve breakeven results before income taxes see note 23 segment and geographical information to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for more information 

  

product revenue 

  

the following table sets forth the total amounts of solar modules and solar power systems revenue recognized for the years ended december 31 2010  december 26 2009  and december 27 2008  for the purposes of the following table a solar module revenue is composed of total revenues from the sale of solar modules to third parties and b solar power systems revenue is composed of total revenues from the sale of complete solar power systems and related services including the solar modules installed in the solar power systems 



  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

as of december 31 2010  we had 11138 million in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities compared with 11143 million as of december 26 2009  

  

the following developments have impacted or are expected to impact our liquidity 

  

   

   

   

  

we believe that our current cash cash equivalents marketable securities cash flows from operating activities revolving credit facility and access to the capital markets will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months we intend to continue to carefully execute our growth plans and manage credit and market risk however if our financial results or operating plans change from our current assumptions we may not have sufficient resources to support our business plan 

  

our expanding systems business is expected to have increasing liquidity requirements in the future solar power project development cycles which span the time between the identification of land and the commercial operation of a photovoltaic power plant vary substantially and can take many months or years to mature as a result of these long project cycles we may need to make significant upfront investments of resources in advance of the signing of power purchase agreements and epc contracts and the receipt of any revenue these amounts include payment of interconnection and other deposits some of which are nonrefundable entering into of letters of credit and incurring preliminary engineering permitting legal and other expenses we have historically financed these upfront investments primarily using working capital and cash on hand in the future we may also engage in one or more debt or equity financings such financings could result in increased expenses or dilution to our existing stockholders if we are unable to obtain debt or equity financing on reasonable terms we may be unable to execute our expansion strategy 

  

the unprecedented disruption in the credit markets that began in 2008 has had a significant adverse impact on a number of financial institutions as of december 31 2010  our liquidity and investments have not been materially adversely impacted by the current credit environment and we believe that they will not be materially adversely impacted in the near future we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity and the credit markets however we cannot predict with any certainty the impact to us of any further disruption in the credit environment 

  

cash flows 

  

the following table summarizes the key cash flow metrics for the years ended december 31 2010  december 26 2009  and december 27 2008 in thousands 



  

operating activities 

  

cash provided by operating activities was 7055 million during 2010  compared with 6752 million during 2009  the increase in operating cash flows during 2010 was primarily due to an increase in cash received from customers and a decrease in income taxes paid partially offset by an increase in payments to suppliers and associates in addition we recorded excess tax benefits related to sharebased compensation arrangements which decreased our operating cash flow see financing activities for further information 

  

cash received from customers increased to 24581 million during 2010 compared with 19576 million during 2009  primarily due to an increase in net sales from 20662 million during 2009 to 25635 million during 2010  the increase in cash received from customers was offset by an increase in cash paid to suppliers and associates from 11237 million during 2009 to 16148 million during 2010  mainly due to an increase in raw material and component purchases an increase in personnelrelated costs due to higher headcount and other costs supporting our growth excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation arrangements increased to 694 million during 2010 compared with 49 million during 2009  

  

cash provided by operating activities was 6752 million during 2009 compared with 4631 million during 2008 net cash provided by operating activities during 2009 resulted primarily from an increase in net income and the impact of noncash items that were recorded on our statements of operations primarily depreciation and amortization expense and stockbased compensation expense offset by an increase in operating assets primarily accounts receivable and deferred project costs 

  

cash received from customers increased to 19576 million during 2009 compared with 12038 million during 2008 primarily due to an increase in net sales offset by an increase in accounts receivable of 1222 million the increase in accounts 

  

receivable was primarily due to the amendment of certain of our customers’ supply contracts to extend their payment terms from net 10 days to net 45 days primarily to increase liquidity in our sales channel and to reflect longer module shipment times from our manufacturing plants in malaysia and due to additional volume shipped during 2009 our net sales increased from 12463 million during 2008 to 20662 million during 2009 

  

cash paid to suppliers and associates increased to 11237 million during 2009 from 7231 million during 2008 mainly due to an increase in raw material and component purchases an increase in personnelrelated costs due to higher headcount and other costs supporting our growth inventory increased by 521 million of which 322 million related to an increase in finished goods inventory as a result of inventory requirements for utility scale projects in north america 

  

income taxes paid net of refunds were 801 million during 2010  compared with 1478 million during 2009 and 20 million during 2008 respectively 

  

investing activities 

  

cash used in investing activities was 7421 million during 2010  compared with 7017 million during 2009  cash used in investing activities during 2010 included capital expenditures of 5889 million  which increased by 3090 million from 2799 million during 2009  the increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to the construction of two new plants adjacent to our existing plants in malaysia and the expansion of our plants in perrysburg ohio and frankfurtoder germany also during 2010  we increased cash by reducing our investment in marketable securities by 948 million and used cash to fund 431 million for estimated future endoflife collection and recycling costs of solar modules that we sold during fiscal 2009 amounts that we set aside for future solar module collection and recycling costs are deposited in a custodial account under the name of a trust with a large bank as investment advisor amounts in this account are invested in longterm marketable securities which we classify as restricted investments on our balance sheet during 2010  cash provided by investing activities included principal payments of 617 million received on our notes receivable on july 12 2010 we completed the acquisition of nextlight renewable power in an all cash transaction for 2965 million  net of cash acquired 

  

cash used in investing activities during 2009 resulted primarily from capital expenditures of 2799 million  the net purchase of marketable securities of 3425 million  the net investment in notes receivable of 742 million  and an increase in our restricted cash and investments of 42 million  capital expenditures were primarily for the construction of new plants in malaysia and the expansion of our plant in perrysburg ohio 

  

cash used in investing activities was 7017 million during 2009 compared with 3084 million during 2008 cash used in investing activities during 2009 resulted primarily from the net purchase of marketable securities of 3425 million the net investment in notes receivable of 742 million to fund construction of various pv power generation facilities capital expenditures of 2799 million and an increase of 42 million in restricted investments to fund our solar module collection and recycling program capital expenditures during 2009 related primarily to the expansion of our plant in perrysburg ohio and completion of construction of our new plants in malaysia see note 12 notes receivable to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for more information regarding the abovereferenced notes receivable 

  

on april 3 2009 we completed the acquisition of the solar power project development business of optisolar inc the total consideration consisted of 2972420 shares of our common stock of which 355096 shares represented a contingent consideration the total purchase price based on the closing price of our common stock on april 3 2009 of 13438 per share was 3994 million see note 4 acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

  

we expect to spend up to 11 billion in capital expenditures during 2011 including expenditures related to the expansions of our existing manufacturing facilities in malaysia and germany and the construction of new manufacturing facilities in blanquefort france vietnam and the united states we have put the construction of our blanquefort france manufacturing plant on hold until we have greater clarity about the future of the french market a majority of our capital expenditures for 2011 will be incurred in foreign currencies and are therefore subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

  

at the beginning of each fiscal year we prefund our estimated solar module collection and recycling costs for solar modules that we sold during the prior fiscal year through a custodial account with a large bank as investment advisor in the name of a trust for which first solar inc first solar malaysia sdn bhd and first solar manufacturing gmbh are grantors for this purpose we assume a minimum service life of 25 years for our solar modules prior to june 2009 we prefunded our estimated solar module collection and recycling costs through a financial services company at december 31 2010 and december 26 2009 we had 860 million and 365 million respectively in the custodial account which we classified in our restricted investments on our balance sheet see note 7 restricted cash and investments to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for additional information 

  

  

financing activities 

  

cash provided by financing activities was 1505 million during 2010 compared with cash used in financing activities of 220 million during 2009 

  

cash provided by financing activities during 2010 resulted primarily from proceeds received from draw downs on our revolving credit facility of 1000 million  excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation arrangements of 694 million as described below and by cash received from employee stock option exercises of 94 million  partially offset by the repayment of longterm debt of 279 million  

  

during the year ended december 31 2010 we realized 694 million of excess tax benefits related to sharebased compensation arrangements from the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards comprised of excess tax deductions primarily as a result of our decision to repatriate approximately 300 million of earnings from certain of our foreign subsidiaries 

  

cash used in financing activities during 2009 resulted primarily from the repayment of longterm debt of 782 million partially offset by draw downs on our malaysian facility agreement net of issuance costs of 447 million related to the equipment export financing agreement for our malaysian manufacturing center proceeds from the issuance of employee stock options during 2009 were 60 million excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation arrangements during 2009 were 49 million 

  

cash used in financing activities was 220 million during 2009 compared with cash provided by financing activities of 1775 million during 2008 cash used in financing activities during 2009 resulted primarily from the repayment of longterm debt of 782 million  which was partially offset by i proceeds of 447 million from the issuance of debt net of issuance cost related to the equipment export financing agreement for our malaysian manufacturing center ii proceeds from the issuance of common stock of 60 million during 2009 mainly due to the exercise of employee stock options and iii excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation arrangements of 49 million  

  

contractual obligations 

  

the following table presents our contractual obligations as of december 31 2010  which consists of legal commitments requiring us to make fixed or determinable cash payments regardless of contractual requirements with the vendor to provide future goods or services we purchase raw materials for inventory services and manufacturing equipment from a variety of vendors during the normal course of business in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help assure adequate supply we enter into agreements with suppliers that either allow us to procure goods and services when we choose or that establish purchase requirements 



  

   

   

in addition to the amounts shown in the table above we have recorded 679 million of unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with asc 740 income taxes  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 

  

debt and credit sources 

  

  

revolving credit facility 

  

on september 4 2009 we entered into a revolving credit facility with several financial institutions as lenders jpmorgan chase securities llc and banc of america securities llc served as jointlead arrangers and bookrunners with jpmorgan chase bank na also acting as administrative agent the credit agreement initially provided first solar inc and certain of its subsidiaries with a senior secured threeyear revolving credit facility in an aggregate available amount of 3000 million  a portion of which was available for letters of credit proceeds from the credit facility may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes in connection with the credit agreement we also entered into a guarantee and collateral agreement and foreign security agreements 

  

on october 15 2010 we amended the credit agreement governing this existing revolving credit facility the amended and restated credit agreement increased the aggregate amount available under this facility from 3000 million to 6000 million  all of which is available for letters of credit subject to certain conditions we have the right to request an increase in the aggregate commitments under this facility up to 7500 million  in addition the term for this facility has been extended from three to five years and will mature in 2015 see also note 14 debt to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k for further information about this revolving credit facility

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

foreign currency exchange risk 

  

  

our international operations accounted for 87  93  and 95 of our net sales during the years ended december 31 2010  december 26 2009  and december 27 2008  respectively of which 84  92  and 100 of these international sales respectively were denominated in euros as a result we have exposure to foreign exchange risk with respect to almost all of our net sales fluctuations in exchange rates particularly in the us dollar to euro exchange rate affect our gross and net profit margins and could result in foreign exchange and operating losses in the past most of our exposure to foreign exchange risk has related to currency gains and losses between the times we sign and settle our sales contracts for example our supply contracts obligate us to deliver solar modules at a fixed price in euros per watt and do not adjust for fluctuations in the us dollar to euro exchange rate for the years ended december 31 2010  december 26 2009  and december 27 2008  a 10 change in the euro exchange rates would have impacted our net euro sales by 1846 million  1777 million  and 1183 million  respectively for our manufacturing operations in germany and malaysia and those under construction in vietnam and blanquefort france many of our operating expenses for the plants in these countries are or will be denominated in the local currency 

  

our primary foreign currency exposures are cash flow exposure transaction exposure and earnings translation exposure 

  

cash flow exposure we expect many of the components of our business to have material future cash flows including revenues and expenses that will be denominated in currencies other than the components functional currency our primary cash flow exposures are customer collections and vendor payments changes in the exchange rates between our components functional currencies and the other currencies in which they transact will cause fluctuations in the cash flows we expect to receive when these cash flows are realized or settled accordingly we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the value of a portion of these forecasted cash flows these foreign exchange contracts qualified for accounting as cash flow hedges in accordance with asc 815 derivatives and hedging  and we designated them as such we initially report the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss in “accumulated other comprehensive income loss” and subsequently reclassify amounts into earnings when the hedged transaction is settled 

  

most of our german plant’s operating expenses are denominated in euros creating natural hedges against the currency risk in our net sales during 2010  we purchased foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the exchange risk on forecasted cash flows denominated in euro as of december 31 2010  the unrealized loss on these contracts was 14 million and the total notional value of the contracts was €7420 million  9869 million at the balance sheet close rate on december 31 2010 of 133 €100 the weighted average forward exchange rate for these contracts was 133 €100 at december 31 2010  

  

transaction exposure many components of our business have assets and liabilities primarily receivables investments accounts payable debt solar module collection and recycling liabilities and intercompany transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the components functional currency changes in the exchange rates between our components functional currencies and the other currencies in which these assets and liabilities are denominated can create fluctuations in our reported consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other financial instruments to hedge assets and liabilities against the shortterm effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations the gains and losses on the foreign exchange forward contracts will offset all or part of the transaction gains and losses that we recognize in earnings on the related foreign currency assets and liabilities as of december 31 2010  the total unrealized gain on our foreign exchange forward contracts was 05 million  these contracts have maturities of less than three months  

  

as of december 31 2010  the notional values of our foreign exchange forward contracts were as follows notional amounts and us dollar equivalents in millions 



  

if the us dollar would have weakened by 10 against the euro malaysian ringgit japanese yen and canadian dollar the impact on our income before income taxes during the years ended december 31 2010 and december 26 2009 would have been 

  

66 million unfavorable and 05 million favorable respectively if the us dollar would have weakened by 10 against the euro and malaysian ringgit the adverse impact on our income before income taxes during the year ended december 27 2008 would have been 116 million  

  

earnings translation exposure fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to consolidate financial statements of our foreign currency denominated subsidiaries we may decide to purchase forward exchange contracts or other instruments to offset this impact from currency fluctuations these contracts would be markedtomarket on a monthly basis and any unrealized gain or loss would be recorded in interest and other income net we do not hedge translation exposure at this time but may do so in the future 

  

in the past currency exchange rate fluctuations have had an impact on our business and results of operations for example currency exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted our cash flows by 127 million  32 million  and 202 million in the years ended december 31 2010  december 26 2009  and december 27 2008  respectively although we cannot predict the impact of future currency exchange rate fluctuations on our business or results of operations we believe that we will continue to have risk associated with currency exchange rate fluctuations in the future 

  

interest rate risk 

  

we are exposed to interest rate risk because many of our customers depend on debt and equity financing to purchase and install a solar power system although the useful life of a solar electricity generation system is considered to be approximately 25 years endusers of our solar modules must pay the entire cost of the system at the time of installation as a result many of our customers rely on debt financing to fund their upfront capital expenditures an increase in interest rates could make it difficult for our endusers to secure the financing necessary to purchase and install a system this could lower demand for our solar modules and system development services and reduce our net sales in addition we believe that a significant percentage of our endusers install solar power systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt an increase in interest rates could lower an investor’s return on investment in a system or make alternative investments more attractive relative to solar power systems which in each case could cause these endusers to seek alternative investments that promise higher returns 

  

we use interest rate swap agreements to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated with certain of our debt instruments we do not use such swap agreements for speculative or trading purposes during may 2008 we entered into a eurodenominated credit facility to finance some of the equipment cost for our malaysian manufacturing center the loans under the fixedrate portion of the credit facility bear interest on the outstanding unpaid principal balance at an annual rate of 454 the loans under the floatingrate portion of the credit facility bear interest on the outstanding unpaid principal balance at the euro interbank offered rate euribor plus a margin of 055 on may 29 2009  we entered into an interest rate swap contract to hedge a portion of the floating rate loans under our malaysian credit facility which became effective on september 30 2009 with a notional value of €573 million  762 million at the balance sheet close rate on december 31 2010 of 133 €100 and pursuant to which we are entitled to receive the sixmonth floating euribor and required to pay a fixed rate of 280  the notional amount of the interest rate swap contract is scheduled to decline in correspondence to our scheduled principal payments on the underlying hedged debt as of december 31 2010  the notional value of this interest rate swap contract was €479 million  637 million at the balance sheet close rate on december 31 2010 of 133 €100 this derivative instrument qualifies for accounting as a cash flow hedge in accordance with asc 815 and we designated it as such we determined that our interest rate swap contract was highly effective as a cash flow hedge at december 31 2010  

  

in addition we invest in debt securities which exposes us to interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and provide liquidity on demand while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the market value of the investment to fluctuate for example if we hold a security that was issued with an interest rate fixed at the thenprevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises the market value of our investment will probably decline to minimize this risk we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents marketable securities and investments in a variety of securities as of december 31 2010  our fixedincome investments earned a pretax yield of 136  with a weighted average maturity of 7 months if interest rates were to instantaneously increase decrease by 100 basis points the market value of our total investment portfolio could decrease increase by 21 million  the direct risk to us associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and we do not believe that a 10 change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows as of december 31 2010  all of our marketable securities were in commercial paper corporate debt securities federal and foreign agency debt foreign government obligations and supranational debt

we are exposed to price risks for the raw materials components and energy costs used in the manufacture and transportation of our solar modules also some of our raw materials and components are sourced from a limited number of suppliers or a single supplier we endeavor to qualify multiple suppliers using a robust qualification process in some cases we also enter into longterm supply contracts for raw materials and components but these arrangements can be of shorter duration than the term of our supply contracts with our customers as a result we remain exposed to price changes in the raw materials and components used in our solar modules in addition a failure by a key supplier could disrupt our supply chain which could result in higher prices andor a disruption in our manufacturing process since our selling price under our supply contracts does not adjust in the event of price changes in our underlying raw materials or components and since our supply contracts require minimum deliveries of our products during their terms we are unable to pass along changes in the cost of the raw materials and components for our products and may be in default of our delivery obligations if we experience a manufacturing disruption 

  

credit risk 

  

we have certain financial and derivative instruments that subject us to credit risk these consist primarily of cash cash equivalents investments trade accounts receivable interest rate swap contracts and foreign exchange forward contracts we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial and derivative instruments we place cash cash equivalents investments interest rate swap contracts and foreign exchange forward contracts with various highquality financial institutions and limit the amount of credit risk from any one counterparty we continuously evaluate the credit standing of our counterparty financial institutions

 item 9a controls and procedures 

  

a evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

  

we maintain “disclosure controls and procedures” as such term is defined in rule 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met additionally in designing disclosure controls and procedures our management was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures the design of any disclosure control and procedure also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 

  

based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level 

  

b management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate “internal control over financial reporting” as such 

  

term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 

  

based on the results of our evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2010  

  

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2010 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in its report which appears herein 

  

c changes in internal control over financial reporting 

  

we are in the process of converting to our new enterprise resource planning erp system implementation of the new erp system is scheduled to occur in phases and we completed phase i of this implementation on june 27 2010 the first day of our third fiscal quarter of 2010 for a discussion of risks relating to the implementation of a new erp system please see the risk factor entitled “implementing a new enterprise resource planning system could interfere with our business or operations and could adversely impact our financial position results of operations and cash flows” in item 1a risk factors” in this annual report on form 10k  we will continue to implement our erp system in stages and each stage may affect significant components of our internal control over financial reporting 

  

except for the new system implementation noted above there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter ended december 31 2010 covered by this annual report on form 10k that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

  

d inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

  

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within our company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

 item 1 business 

overview 

we manufacture and sell solar modules with an advanced thin film semiconductor technology and we design construct and sell photovoltaic pv solar power systems 

in addressing a growing global demand for pv solar electricity we target markets with varying approaches depending on the underlying economics market requirements and distribution channels in subsidized feedin tariff fit markets such as germany we have historically sold most of our solar modules to solar project developers system integrators and independent power producers in other markets such as the united states the demand for solar has been primarily driven by renewable portfolio standards requiring regulated utilities to supply a portion of their total electricity from renewable energy sources such as solar power to meet the needs of these markets and enable balance of system cost reductions we have developed a fully integrated systems business that can provide lowcost turnkey utilityscale pv system solutions for system owners and low cost electricity to utility endusers by building a fully integrated systems business we believe we are in a position to expand our business in transitional and eventually economically sustainable markets in which subsidies or incentives are minimal which are expected to develop in areas with abundant solar resources and sizable electricity demand such as the united states china india and parts of europe in the longterm we plan on competing on an economic basis with conventional fossil fuel based peaking power generation 

  

in furtherance of our goal of delivering the lowest cost of solar energy and achieving price parity with conventional fossilfuel based peak electricity generation we are continually focused on reducing pv system costs in three primary areas module manufacturing balance of system bos costs consisting of costs of components of a solar power system other than the solar modules including inverters mounting hardware grid interconnection equipment wiring and other devices and installation labor costs and cost of capital first with respect to our module manufacturing costs our advanced technology has allowed us to reduce our average module manufacturing costs to the lowest in the world based on publicly available information in 2009 our total average manufacturing costs were 087 per watt which we believe is significantly less than those of traditional crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers by continuing to improve conversion efficiency and production line throughput lower material cost and drive volume scale to further decrease overhead costs we believe that we can further reduce our manufacturing costs per watt and maintain our cost advantage over traditional crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers second by continuing to improve conversion efficiency leverage volume procurement around standardized hardware platforms and accelerate installation time we believe we can continue to make substantial reductions in bos costs which represent over half of all costs associated with a typical utilityscale pv solar power system finally we believe that continuing to strengthen our financial position including our balance sheet and credit profile will enable us to continue to lower the cost of capital associated with our solar power systems thereby further enhancing the economic viability of our projects and lowering the cost of electricity generated by solar power systems that incorporate our modules and technology 

page 1 

  

we are the worlds largest pv solar module manufacturer and produced more than 11 gigawatts gw of solar modules in 2009 becoming the first pv company to attain this production volume in a single year we manufacture our solar modules on highthroughput production lines and perform all manufacturing steps ourselves in an automated proprietary continuous process our solar modules employ a thin layer of semiconductor material to convert sunlight into electricity our manufacturing process eliminates the multiple supply chain operators and expensive and time consuming batch processing steps that are used to produce a crystalline silicon solar module currently we manufacture our solar modules at our perrysburg ohio frankfurtoder germany and kulim malaysia manufacturing facilities with additional manufacturing facilities planned for construction in kulim malaysia and france and conduct our research and development activities primarily at our perrysburg ohio manufacturing facility 

 

our fully integrated solar power systems business includes i project development ii engineering procurement and construction epc services iii operating and maintenance om services and iv project finance expertise all as described in more detail below 

 

 

 

 

we believe that combining our reliable low cost module manufacturing capability with our systems business enables us to more rapidly reduce the price of solar electricity to accelerate the adoption of our technology in large scale systems and to further our mission to create enduring value by enabling a world powered by clean affordable solar electricity 

segment information 

  

  we operate our business in two segments our components segment designs manufactures and sells solar modules to solar project developers and system integrators through our systems segment we have the capability to provide a complete pv solar power system for utilityscale or large commercial systems which includes project development epc om services and when required project finance we view the sale of solar modules from the components segment as the core driver of our profitability return on net assets and cash throughput and we view our systems segment as an enabler to drive module throughput 

as of december 26 2009 our systems segment had not met the quantitative criteria for disclosure as a separate reporting segment   see also note 22 “segment and geographic information” to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k 

page 2 

  

components business 

our components segment which is our principal business involves the design manufacture and sale of solar modules which convert sunlight to electricity 

 

  solar modules 

each solar module is approximately 2ft × 4ft 60cm × 120cm and had an average rated power of approximately 75 watts 73 watts and 70 watts for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively our solar module is a singlejunction polycrystalline thin film structure that uses cadmium telluride as the absorption layer and cadmium sulfide as the window layer cadmium telluride has absorption properties that are highly matched to the solar spectrum and has the potential to deliver competitive conversion efficiencies using only about 1 of the semiconductor material used by traditional crystalline silicon solar modules our thin film technology also has relatively high energy performance in low light and high temperature environments compared with traditional crystalline silicon solar modules 

  manufacturing process 

we have integrated our manufacturing processes into a continuous integrated production line with the following three stages the “deposition” stage the “cell definition” stage and the “assembly and test” stage in the deposition stage panels of treated glass are robotically loaded onto the production line where they are cleaned heated and coated with a layer of cadmium sulfide followed by a layer of cadmium telluride using our proprietary vapor transport deposition technology after which the semiconductorcoated plates are cooled rapidly to increase strength in our cell definition stage we use high speed lasers to transform the large single semiconductorcoated plate into a series of interconnected cells that deliver the desired current and voltage output our proprietary laser scribing technology is capable of accomplishing accurate and complex scribes at high speeds finally in the assembly and test stage we apply busbars laminate a rear glass cover sheet and termination wires seal the joint box and subject each solar module to a solar simulator and current leakage test the final assembly stage is the only stage in our production line that requires manual processing 

our manufacturing facilities in perrysburg ohio frankfurtoder germany and kulim malaysia have each received both an iso 90012000 quality system certification and iso 140012004 environmental system certification we anticipate that our additional manufacturing facilities planned for construction in france and kulim malaysia will also obtain these certifications in 2011 during 2009 our perrysburg facility also received the occupational health and safety standards ohsas 18001 certification an international occupational health and safety management system specification 

research development and engineering 

we continue to devote a substantial amount of resources to research and development with the primary objective of lowering the per watt cost of electricity generated by photovoltaic systems using our solar modules within our components business we focus our research and development activities on among other areas continuing to increase the conversion efficiency of our solar modules and improving manufacturing efficiencies including volume ramp throughput improvement and material cost reduction we believe the most promising ways of increasing the conversion efficiency of our solar modules include maximizing the number of photons that reach the absorption layer of the semiconductor material to facilitate conversion into electrons thereby maximizing the number of electrons that reach the surface of the semiconductor and minimizing the electrical losses between the semiconductor layer and the back metal conductor 

in the course of our research and development activities we continuously explore and research new technologies in our efforts to sustain competitive differentiation in our modules we typically qualify process and product improvements for full production at our ohio plant and then use our “copy smart” process to propagate them to our other production lines we believe that this systematic approach to research and development will provide continuous improvements and ensure uniform adoption across our production lines in addition our production lines are replicas of each other using our “copy smart” process and as a result a process or production improvement on one line can be rapidly deployed to other production lines 

  

  customers 

  

with respect to our components business during 2009 we sold most of our solar modules to solar project developers and system integrators headquartered in germany france spain and italy our customers typically develop construct own and operate solar power plants or sell turnkey solar power plants to endusers that include owners of land owners of agricultural buildings owners of commercial warehouses offices and industrial buildings public agencies municipal government authorities utility companies and financial investors that desire to own large scale solar power plant projects 

page 3 

  

as of december 26 2009 we had longterm supply contracts for the sale of solar modules with fourteen principal customers longterm supply contracts headquartered throughout the european union we also have a fiveyear agreement with a solar power system project developer and system integrator in the united states which is a related party together these contracts account for a significant portion of our planned module production over the period from 2010 through 2013 and therefore will significantly affect our overall financial performance we have in the past amended pricing and other terms in our longterm supply contracts in order to remain competitive as described below and we may decide in the future to further amend such contracts in order to address the highly competitive environment in addition we enter into module sale agreements or standard purchase orders with customers for specific projects 

 

during the first quarter of 2009 we amended our longterm supply contracts with certain customers to further reduce the sales price per watt under these contracts in 2009 and 2010 in exchange for increases in the volume of solar modules to be delivered under the contracts we also extended the payment terms for certain customers under these contracts from net 10 days to net 45 days to increase liquidity in our sales channel and to reflect longer module shipment times from our manufacturing plants in malaysia during the third quarter of 2009 we amended our longterm supply contracts with certain of our customers to implement a program which extends a price rebate to certain of these customers for solar modules purchased from us and installed in germany the intent of this program is to enable our customers to successfully compete in our core segments in germany the rebate program applies a specified rebate rate to solar modules sold for solar power projects in germany at the beginning of each quarter for the upcoming quarter the rebate program is subject to periodic review and we adjust the rebate rate quarterly upward or downward as appropriate the rebate period commenced during the third quarter of 2009 and terminates at the end of the fourth quarter of 2010 customers need to meet certain requirements in order to be eligible for and benefit from this program 

during 2009 principal customers of our components business were blitzstrom gmbh edf en development gehrlicher solar ag juwi solar gmbh and phoenix solar ag during 2009 each of these five customers individually accounted for between 10 and 19 of our component segment’s net sales all of our other customers individually accounted for less than 10 of our net sales during 2009 the loss of any of our major customers could have an adverse effect on our business as we expand our manufacturing capacity we are seeking to develop additional customer relationships in other markets and regions which would reduce our customer and geographic concentration and dependence 

while our longterm supply contracts have certain firm purchase commitments these contracts are subject to amendments made by us or requested by our customers such as the above mentioned amendments entered into during 2009 these amendments decreased the expected revenue under our longterm supply contracts during 2009 in addition our longterm supply contracts are substantially denominated in euros and therefore are subject to exchange rate fluctuations between the euro and us dollar the strengthening of the euro compared to the us dollar during 2009 partially offset the decrease in the expected revenue under our longterm contracts resulting from the 2009 amendments 

as of december 26 2009 the longterm supply contracts in the aggregate allowed for approximately 38 billion 33 billion denominated in euro at an assumed exchange rate of 115€100 and 02 billion denominated in usd in sales from 2010 to 2013 as of december 27 2008 the longterm supply contracts in the aggregate allowed for approximately 58 billion 49 billion denominated in euro at an assumed exchange rate of 115€100 and 02 billion denominated in usd in sales from 2009 to 2013 the abovereferenced dollar amounts relating to the longterm supply contracts declined from 2008 to 2009 primarily due to revenue recognized for contracted volumes sold in 2009 module pricing adjustments the impact of the rebate program implemented in 2009 as described above and preset price reductions under the terms of the longterm supply contracts 

we anticipate that approximately 55 of the aggregate contracted revenue under the longterm supply contracts as of december 26 2009 will not be fulfilled in 2010 because they are associated with deliveries to be made in 2011 and later periods we believe that the aggregate dollar amount associated with the longterm supply contracts at any particular date is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future revenue for any particular period because the fulfillment of such amount is subject to a variety of factors including the factors described above 

competition 

the renewable energy solar energy and solar module sectors are highly competitive and continually evolving as participants strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete within the larger electric power industry we expect to face continued competition which may result in price reductions reduced margins or loss of market share with respect to our components business we believe that our main sources of competition are crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers silicon and nonsilicon based thin film module manufacturers and companies developing solar thermal and concentrated photovoltaic technologies among photovoltaic module and cell manufacturers the principal methods of competition are price per watt production capacity conversion efficiency reliability warranty terms and finance ability at december 26 2009 the global photovoltaic industry consisted of more than 150 manufacturers of solar cells and modules 

page 4 

  

in addition we expect to compete with future entrants to the photovoltaic industry that offer new technological solutions we may also face competition from semiconductor manufacturers and semiconductor equipment manufacturers or their customers several of which have already announced their intention to start production of photovoltaic cells solar modules or turnkey production lines some of these competitors may be part of larger corporations and have greater financial resources and greater brand name recognition than we do and may as a result be better positioned to adapt to changes in the industry or the economy as a whole 

we also face competition from companies that currently offer or are developing other renewable energy technologies including wind hydropower geothermal biomass and tidal technologies and other power generation sources that burn conventional fossil fuels 

raw materials 

our manufacturing process uses approximately 20 types of raw materials and components to construct a complete solar module one critical raw material in our production process is cadmium telluride of the other raw materials and components the following eight are also critical to our manufacturing process front glass coated with thermal conductive oxide cadmium sulfide photo resist laminate tempered back glass cord platecord plate cap lead wire and solar connectors before we use these materials and components in our manufacturing process a supplier must undergo a qualification process that can last up to 12 months depending on the type of raw material or component although we continually evaluate new suppliers and currently are qualifying several new suppliers a few of our critical materials or components are sole sourced and most others are supplied by a limited number of suppliers 

collection and recycling program 

consistent with the environmental philosophy of extended producer responsibility we have established the solar industrys first comprehensive prefunded module collection and recycling program the program is designed to maximize the recovery of valuable materials for use in new modules or other new products and minimize the environmental impacts associated with our modules at the end of their useful life approximately 90 of each collected first solar module is recycled into new products including new modules endusers can request collection and recycling of their solar modules by us at any time at no cost we prefund the estimated collection and recycling cost at the time of sale assuming for this purpose a minimum service life of approximately 25 years for our solar modules in addition to achieving substantial environmental benefits our solar module collection and recycling program may provide us the opportunity to resell or redistribute working modules or recover certain raw materials and components for reuse in our manufacturing process we currently have recycling facilities operating at each manufacturing facility for manufacturing scrap warranty returns and modules collected at the end of their useful life that produce glass suitable for use in the production of new glass products and extract metals that will be further processed by a third party supplier to produce semiconductor materials for reuse in our solar modules 

to ensure that the prefunded amounts are available regardless of our financial status in the future a trust structure has been established funds are put into custodial accounts in the name of a trustee only the trustee can distribute funds from the custodial accounts and these funds cannot be accessed for any purpose other than for administering module collection and recycling either by us or a third party executing the collection and recycling services to provide further assurance that sufficient funds will be available our module collection and recycling program including the financing arrangement is audited periodically by an independent thirdparty auditor 

 

  solar module warranty 

we provide a limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for five years following delivery to the owners of our solar modules we also warrant to the owners of our solar modules that solar modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 90 of their power output rating during the first 10 years following their installation and at least 80 of their power output rating during the following 15 years in resolving claims under both the defects and power output warranties we have the option of either repairing or replacing the covered solar module or under the power output warranty providing additional solar modules to remedy the power shortfall our warranties are automatically transferred from the original purchasers of our solar modules to subsequent purchasers as of december 26 2009 our accrued warranty liability was 226 million of which 82 million was classified as current and 144 million was classified as noncurrent 

page 5 

  

systems business 

through our fully integrated systems business we provide a complete pv solar power system solution which includes project development epc services om services and when required project finance 

our systems business has grown over the past several years through a combination of business acquisitions and organic growth on november 30 2007 we completed the acquisition of turner renewable energy llc a privately held company which provided epc services for commercial solar power projects in the united states on april 3 2009 we completed the acquisition of the project development business of optisolar inc which included a multigigawatt project pipeline in january 2010 we completed the acquisition of certain assets from edison mission groups solar project development pipeline consisting of utilityscale solar projects located primarily on private land in california and the southwest 

project development 

our systems business is dependent upon successful completion of project development activities including site selection and acquisition obtaining in a timely manner the requisite interconnection and transmission studies environmental and land use permits maintaining effective site control and entering into a power purchase agreement with an offtaker of the power to be generated by the project these activities culminate in receiving the right to construct and operate a solar power system power purchase agreements define the price and terms the utility customer will pay for power produced from a project entering into a power purchase agreement generally provides the underlying economics needed to advance the construction finance and eventual sale of the project to the longterm site owner and power producer subject to obtaining all necessary permits depending primarily on the location and other site attributes the development cycle can range from one to five years or longer in some circumstances we may be required to spend significant sums for preliminary engineering permitting legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built if there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals we may be forced to incur additional costs andor the right of the offtaker under the power purchase agreement to terminate may be triggered 

our project development activities are currently focused on markets in north america europe and asia 

in north america we have entered into approximately 125gw of power purchase agreements with utilities in the southwestern us and have a pipeline of approximately 150 megawatts mw of projects in canada governed under ontario’s renewable energy standard offer program resop for a total pipeline of 14gw of projects in north america that we expect to develop between 2010 and 2014 

in europe we are engaged in project development activities with respect to certain projects in france and italy that we acquired as part of the optisolar pipeline and we are actively evaluating additional project opportunities in europe 

in asia our project development activities include our initiatives in china in september 2009 we entered into a memorandum of understanding with the ordos china city government outlining a longterm strategic relationship between the parties pursuant to which we would through an appropriate business model develop and construct a 2000mw photovoltaic power plant located within the ordos new energy industry demonstration zone in china in november 2009 we entered into a cooperation framework agreement with the ordos government outlining additional project details timing and local support for the 2000mw power plant the memorandum of understanding and the corporation framework agreements set forth the agreement in principle of the parties concerning the project and related activities and final agreement between the parties is subject to the negotiation and execution of definitive agreements among the parties 

in the fourth quarter of 2009 we sold our 20mw solar project in sarnia ontario canada to enbridge inc the power output of the sarnia facility will be sold to the ontario power authority pursuant to a 20year power purchase agreement under the terms of the ontario resop program later in the fourth quarter of 2009 we entered into an agreement with enbridge inc to expand the sarnia facility from 20mw to 80mw when completed later in 2010 the sarnia facility is expected to be the largest pv solar facility in north america in the fourth quarter of 2009 we also sold our 21mw solar project in blythe california to nrg energy inc electricity generated by the blythe facility which is currently california’s largest pv solar generation facility is being sold to southern california edison under a 20year power purchase agreement 

page 6 

  

customers 

with respect to our systems business our customers consist of investor owned utilities independent power developers and producers commercial and industrial companies and other system owners who purchase completed solar power plants epc services andor operation and maintenance services from us 

competition 

with respect to our systems business we face competition from other providers of renewable energy solutions including developers of photovoltaic solar thermal and concentrated solar power systems and developers of other forms of renewable energy projects including wind hydropower geothermal biomass and tidal projects to the extent other solar module manufacturers become more vertically integrated we expect to face increased competition from such companies as well we also face competition from other epc companies and joint ventures between epc companies and solar companies 

sales and marketing 

historically the majority of our module sales have been for gridconnected ground or commercial roof mounted solar power systems in germany and other european union countries with feedin tariff subsidies these feedin tariff subsidies have been critical for the development of the solar industry because they provided the demand visibility required for module manufacturers and other participants in the solar value chain to reduce costs and drive scale in 2007 we began to identify and target certain key transition markets such as the united states that had the potential to bridge the gap from the existing feedin tariff markets to sustainable markets within these transition markets our strategy is to advocate for market structures and policies that drive demand for solar power systems and to identify and break constraints to the successful migration to sustainable solar markets in furtherance of this objective we have developed a fully integrated systems business to increase module throughput drive cost reduction across the value chain identify and break constraints to sustainable markets and to deliver the most compelling solutions to our customers and end users 

economic incentives 

government subsidies economic incentives and other support for solar electricity generation generally include feedin tariffs net metering programs renewable portfolio standards tax incentives loan guarantees grants rebates low interest loans and grid access initiatives 

under a feedin tariff subsidy the government sets prices that regulated utilities are required to pay for renewable electricity generated by endusers the prices are set above market rates and may differ based on system size or application net metering programs enable endusers to sell excess solar electricity to their local utility in exchange for a credit against their utility bills the policies governing net metering vary by state and utility some utilities pay the enduser upfront while others credit the enduser’s bill 

under a renewable portfolio standard rps the government requires regulated utilities to supply a portion of their total electricity in the form of renewable electricity some programs further specify that a portion of the renewable energy quota must be from solar electricity while others provide no specific technology requirement for renewable electricity generation rpstype mechanisms have been adopted in a majority of us states regulations vary from state to state and currently there is no federal rps mandate the state of california’s rps goal of 33 of electricity from renewable sources by 2020 is currently the most significant rps program in the united states in magnitude and it is contributing to the expansion of the utilityscale solar systems market in that state

tax incentive programs exist in the united states at both the federal and state level and can take the form of investment and production tax credits accelerated depreciation and sales and property tax exemptions at the federal level investment tax credits for business and residential solar systems have gone through several cycles of enactment and expiration since the 1980’s in october 2008 the united states congress extended the 30 federal investment tax credit itc for both residential and commercial solar installations for eight years through december 31 2016 the itc is a primary economic driver of solar installations in the united states its extension through 2016 has contributed to greater medium term demand visibility in the us however its expiration at the end of 2016 unless extended underscores the need for the levelized cost of electricity from solar systems to continue to decline toward grid parity in february 2009 the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 arra was signed into law in addition to adopting certain fiscal stimulus measures that could benefit ongrid solar electricity applications arra created a new program through the department of the treasury which provides cash grants equal to 30 of the cost of the system for solar installations that are placed into service during 2009 and 2010 and for certain solar installations for which construction begins prior to december 31 2010 this cash grant is available in lieu of receiving the 30 federal investment tax credit the intent of this program was to ensure that investors who had historically supported the renewable energy programs would not be constrained from investing in these transactions by tax losses they may have suffered during the recent credit crisis other measures adopted by arra that could benefit ongrid solar electricity generation include the following 1 a department of energy loan guarantee program for renewable energy projects renewable energy manufacturing facilities and electric power transmission projects and 2 a 50 bonus depreciation for solar installations placed in service during 2009 various legislation has been proposed to extend and slightly modify the itc incentives to continue to ensure shortterm investor tax positions do not limit future investment in renewable energy projects in addition legislation is being proposed which could extend the bonus depreciation benefit for projects completed in 2010 however enactment of the extension or enhancement of such incentives is highly uncertain 

rebate programs for solar installations in california and several other states have increased the quantity of solar energy from distributed photovoltaic systems typically smaller nonutility scale pv systems colocated with residential or commercial rooftop endusers and have contributed to demand for pv solar modules and systems 

regulations and policies relating to electricity pricing and interconnection also stimulate demand for distributed generation from photovoltaic systems pv systems generate most of their electricity during midday and the early afternoon hours when the demand for and cost of electricity is highest as a result electricity generated by pv systems mainly competes with expensive peak hour electricity rather than the lower average price of electricity modifications to the peak hour pricing policies of utilities such as to a flat rate would require pv systems to achieve lower prices in order to compete with the price of electricity 

in europe renewable energy targets in conjunction with feedin tariffs have contributed to the growth in pv solar markets renewable energy targets prescribe how much energy consumption must come from renewable sources while fit policies are intended to support new supply development by providing investor certainty a 2001 european union eu directive for promoting renewable energy use in electricity generation directive 200177ec had set varying national indicative targets for renewable energy production from individual member states a 2009 eu directive on renewable energy directive 200928ec which replaces the 2001 directive sets varying targets for all eu member states in support of the directive’s goal of a 20 share of energy from renewable sources in the eu by 2020 and requires national action plans that establish pathways for the development of renewable energy sources the following is a description of fit policies adopted in certain critical eu markets in support of renewable energy targets 

currently germany which accounted for approximately 65 of our 2009 net sales is the most significant market for our modules and the recent proposed changes to german feedin tariffs are likely to affect our results of operations the german renewable energy law or the eeg was last modified by the german government in 2008 with effect on january 1 2009 at that time feedin tariffs were significantly reduced from earlier levels further under the current legislation germany feedin tariffs declined 9 for roof mounted applications and 11 for ground mounted applications on january 1 2010 and will decline on january 1 2011 a further 8 to 10 based on the volume of pv modules deployed in germany during the 12 months ending on september 30 2010 and the type of pv system this compares to an annual decline of between 5 and 65 under the prior legislation the next review of feedin tariffs for all types of renewable energy was scheduled for 2012 however following the 2009 election of a new centerrightliberal government in germany a further reduction in the pv feedin tariff is currently under discussion and will most likely come into effect in the second or third quarter of 2010 such a reduction in the feedin tariff including any potential further reductions could result in a significant decline in demand and price levels for photovoltaic products in germany which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

in france which accounted for approximately 12 of our 2009 net sales and where we have announced plans to build a twoline manufacturing plant the government amended its feedin tariff on january 12 2010 the new decree became effective january 14 2010 and does not have an expiry date but can be amended at any time the new feedin tariff provides a lower rate than the prior feedin tariff for all applications while introducing among other things a departmental bonus which makes free field projects in the northern regions of france more attractive in addition the inflation index that increases the feedin tariff received by a pv project after its first year of operation was also reduced the current feedin tariff will have a 10 annual digression starting on january 1 2012 

page 8 

  

in italy which accounted for approximately 6 of our 2009 net sales the current legislation provides that the existing feedin tariff will be in effect until the expiration of a 14 month transition period that will begin once 12gw of photovoltaic systems are installed under the existing feedin tariff any photovoltaic system that is interconnected before the expiration of the transition period will also receive the feedin tariff currently in effect it is expected that the 12gw threshold will be reached in 2010 it is further expected that the italian government will propose and enact a new reduced feedin tariff before the end of 2010 

 

in spain which accounted for approximately 3 of our 2009 net sales the government published the feedin tariff currently in effect for pv systems in september 2008 this feedin tariff introduced a mechanism that requires a pv system to be registered in a national registry in order to obtain the spanish feedin tariff critically under the legislation only a certain number of mws of pv systems so registered are granted a feedin tariff each quarter other pv systems applying for a feedin tariff remain in a queue and will be awarded a feedin tariff in accordance with their place in the queue for 2010 and 2011 the legislation limits the number of mw of pv systems that are awarded a feedin tariff to 560mw and 500mw respectively the current legislation is scheduled to be reviewed by january 1 2012 

in ontario canada a new feedin tariff program was introduced in september 2009 and replaced the renewable energy standard offer program resop as the primary subsidy program for future renewable energy projects in order to participate in the ontario feedin tariff program certain provisions relating to minimum required domestic content and land use restrictions for solar installations must be satisfied the new domestic content and land restriction rules do not apply to our sarnia solar projects and the other projects governed by resop contracts that we acquired in connection with our acquisition of the solar power project development business of optisolar inc in april 2009 however pv solar power systems incorporating our modules would not satisfy the domestic content requirement under the new feedin tariff program currently in effect 

in australia which accounted for approximately 1 of our 2009 net sales the solar industry is driven by several regulatory initiatives that support the installation of solar pv modules in both rooftop and freefield applications including the nationwide renewable energy target scheme that has set a renewable energy goal for australia of 20 by 2020 in july 2009 the solar homes and communities plan which previously provided the primary incentive for rooftop installations was replaced with the less lucrative solar credits scheme 

in china governmental authorities have not adopted a feedin tariff policy and currently award solar projects through either a project tendering process or bilateral negotiations we did not have sales in china in 2009 however in september 2009 we entered into a memorandum of understanding with the ordos china city government relating to the construction of a 2gw pv power plant located within the ordos new energy industry demonstration zone in china see “item 1 business — segment information —systems business — project development” 

in 2009 india announced its national solar mission which includes a goal of installing 20gw of solar by 2022 india is expected to announce a feedin tariff for the first phase of the national solar mission in 2010 we did not have any sales in india in 2009 

for more information about risks related to economic incentives please see “item 1a risk factors — reduced growth in or the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives and other support for ongrid solar electricity applications including the anticipated feedin tariff reductions in germany and certain other core markets could reduce demand andor price levels for our solar modules limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales and adversely impact our operating results”

 item 1a risk factors 

an investment in our stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the following information together with the other information in this annual report on form 10k before buying shares of our stock if any of the following risks or uncertainties occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our stock could decline 

  

risks related to our markets and customers 

if photovoltaic technology is not suitable for widespread adoption or if sufficient demand for solar modules does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate our net sales and profit may flatten or decline and we may be unable to sustain profitability 

the solar energy market is at a relatively early stage of development and the extent to which solar modules will be widely adopted is uncertain if photovoltaic technology proves unsuitable for widespread adoption or if demand for solar modules fails to develop sufficiently we may be unable to grow our business or generate sufficient net sales to sustain profitability in addition demand for solar modules in our targeted markets — including germany italy spain france the united states canada china and australia — may not develop or may develop to a lesser extent than we anticipate many factors may affect the viability of widespread adoption of photovoltaic technology and demand for solar modules including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

reduced growth in or the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives and other support for ongrid solar electricity applications including the anticipated feedin tariff reductions in germany and certain other core markets could reduce demand andor price levels for our solar modules and limit our growth or lead to a reduction in our net sales and adversely impact our operating results 

we believe that the nearterm growth of the market for ongrid applications where solar energy is used to supplement the electricity a consumer purchases from the utility network depends significantly on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives federal state and local governmental bodies in many countries most notably germany italy spain france the united states canada china india australia greece and portugal have provided subsidies in the form of feedin tariffs rebates tax incentives and other incentives to endusers distributors systems integrators and manufacturers of photovoltaic products many of these jurisdictions including the majority of us states and numerous european union countries have adopted renewable portfolio standards in which the government requires jurisdictions or regulated utilities to supply a portion of their total electricity from specified sources of renewable energy such as solar wind and hydroelectric power many of these government incentives expire phase out over time require renewal by the applicable authority or may be amended a summary of recent developments in the major government subsidy programs in our core markets follows we expect the feedin tariff in germany and certain other core markets to be reduced earlier than previously expected and such reductions could reduce demand andor price levels for our solar modules lead to a reduction in our net sales and adversely impact our operating results 

german feedin tariffs will be adjusted earlier than previously expected and any downwards adjustment could reduce demand for our solar modules lead to a reduction in our net sales and adversely impact our operating results currently germany which accounted for approximately 65 of our net sales in 2009 is the largest market for our modules and thus recently proposed changes to german feedin tariffs could significantly impact our results of operations a reduction in the pv feedin tariff is currently under discussion and will most likely come into effect in the second or third quarter of 2010 the amount of the fit reductions are expected to vary among roofmounted applications nonagricultural land free field applications and agricultural land free field applications a significant reduction in the fit for agricultural land free field applications in particular would likely cause a significant decline in demand for pv solar systems on agricultural land in germany and contribute to a migration toward roof mounted applications and nonagricultural land free field applications overall reductions in the german feedin tariffs including any potential further reductions could result in a significant decline in demand and price levels for photovoltaic products in germany which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

page 13 

  

in france a new decree effective january 2010 provides for lower feedin tariffs for all applications including as in germany varying reductions for rooftop applications and free field applications while introducing among other things a departmental bonus which makes free field projects in the northern regions of france more attractive the new decree does not have an expiry date but can be amended at any time 

in italy the current legislation provides that the existing feedin tariff will be in effect until the expiration of a 14 month transition period that will begin once 12gw of photovoltaic systems are installed under the existing feedin tariff it is expected that the italian government will propose and enact a new feedin tariff before the end of 2010 current proposals reflect significant fit reductions particularly for ground mounted applications we cannot be certain of the level of such new feedin tariff if the level of such feedin tariff is not adequate to promote the development of the pv industry or pv projects in italy our ability to pursue an expansion strategy in italy would be adversely affected 

 

in spain the current legislation is scheduled to be reviewed by january 1 2012 however an earlier fit adjustment is possible 

in the united states california has been the state where the majority of solar installations and solar power module and system sales have taken place during the past five years the state of california’s rps goal of 33 of electricity from renewable sources by 2020 currently in the form of an executive order from the governor’s office is the most significant rps program in the united states in magnitude and is contributing to the expansion of the utilityscale solar systems market in that state however the continued effectiveness of this rps program could be negatively impacted if the rps goal is not passed by the ca legislature and signed into law see “item 1a risk factors — our ability to pursue an expansion strategy in california beyond existing projects may be adversely affected if california is unable to achieve a 33 renewable mandate through law” below 

the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 provides for certain measures intended to benefit ongrid solar electricity generation and other renewable energy initiatives including 1 a cash grant in lieu of the 30 federal investment tax credit for solar installations that are placed into service during 2009 and 2010 or that begin construction prior to december 31 2010 and are placed into service by january 1 2017 and 2 a 50 bonus depreciation for installations placed in service during 2009 various legislation has been proposed to extend or enhance the 30 grant in lieu of the tax credit as well as bonus depreciation however enactment of the extension or enhancement of such incentives is highly uncertain the failure to extend or enhance these programs may reduce tax equity availability in the case of the grant expiration which may adversely affect our ability to arrange financing for utilityscale projects and may otherwise adversely affect the attractiveness of the us solar market 

in ontario canada a new feedin tariff program was introduced in september 2009 and replaced the renewable energy standard offer program resop as the primary subsidy program for future renewable energy projects in order to participate in the ontario feedin tariff program certain provisions relating to minimum required domestic content and land use restrictions for solar installations must be satisfied the new domestic content and land restriction rules do not apply to our sarnia solar project and the other projects governed by resop contracts that we acquired in connection with our acquisition of the solar power project development business of optisolar inc in april 2009 however our ontario projects in earlier stages of development that are not governed by resop contracts as well as any potential new projects in ontario will be subject to such domestic content and land restriction rules as these rules are currently written we will be unable to fully satisfy such rules in particular the domestic content requirement rules thus projects incorporating our modules will not qualify for the ontario feedin tariff in the event the ontario domestic content and land use restriction rules are not sufficiently modified our ability to participate in the ontario feedin tariff program for future projects will be substantially reduced and possibly completely eliminated and thus our ability to pursue an expansion strategy in ontario canada beyond our existing resop projects would be adversely affected 

in china governmental authorities have not adopted a feedin tariff policy and currently award solar projects through either a project tendering process or bilateral negotiations while the solar industry generally anticipates that china will adopt a solar feedin tariff there is no guarantee this will occur in a timely manner or at all or that any feedin tariff will be economically viable without a feedin tariff the size and attractiveness of china’s solar market may be limited and we may be unable to sell into china at an attractive price limiting one of our anticipated growth markets 

in australia the largescale solar industry is in its infancy and despite several encouraging government funded initiatives to promote largescale solar generation it is uncertain whether such programs can be successfully executed 

in 2009 india announced its national solar mission which includes a goal of installing 20gw of solar by 2022 india is expected to announce a feedin tariff for the first phase of the national solar mission in 2010 there is no guarantee that india will maintain its current 20gw by 2022 goal or adopt the required policies to meet that goal without which the size and attractiveness of india’s solar market may be limited and we may be unable to sell modules or systems in india at an attractive price limiting one of our anticipated growth markets 

emerging subsidy programs may require an extended period of time to attain effectiveness because the applicable permitting and grid connection processes associated with these programs can be lengthy and administratively burdensome 

page 14 

  

in addition if any of these statutes or regulations is found to be unconstitutional or is reduced or discontinued for other reasons sales prices andor volumes of our solar modules in these countries could decline significantly which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

electric utility companies or generators of electricity from fossil fuels or other renewable energy sources could also lobby for a change in the relevant legislation in their markets to protect their revenue streams 

reduced growth in or the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar energy applications especially those in our target markets could limit our growth or cause our net sales to decline and materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our ability to pursue an expansion strategy in california beyond existing projects may be adversely affected if california is unable to achieve a 33 renewable mandate through law 

california currently requires its investorowned utilities ious to procure 20 of their electricity supplies through eligible renewable energy resources by 2010 in addition california through executive order has established a utility procurement goal of 33 renewable electricity by 2020 due to the threat of penalties under the current law investorowned utilities have the incentive to comply and have therefore signed longterm contracts to meet the 20 procurement requirement however since the 33 procurement of renewable electricity by 2020 goal is not enforceable through law it is conceivable that renewable energy procurement in california could peak around 20 of the iou’s electricity retail sales in 2010 if the state legislature and governor’s office are unable to adopt legislation that could be signed into law by the end of 2010 the viability of the 33 rps program would remain at risk california’s current financial difficulties could contribute to an environment in which the 33 rps program could be questioned in addition any weakening or delay of the 33 rps program could contribute to or be accompanied by increased project execution risks delay or costs relating to california authorities such as the california independent system operator under such a scenario our ability to execute a longterm expansion plan to develop additional largescale pv projects in california could be adversely affected 

an increase in interest rates or lending rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets including a reduction in total tax equity availability could make it difficult for endusers to finance the cost of a pv system and could reduce the demand for our solar modules andor lead to a reduction in the average selling price for photovoltaic modules 

many of our customers and our systems business depend on debt financing to fund the initial capital expenditure required to develop build and purchase a pv system as a result an increase in interest rates or lending rates could make it difficult for our customers or our systems business to secure the financing necessary to develop build purchase or install a pv system on favorable terms or at all and thus lower demand for our solar modules which could limit our growth or reduce our net sales due to the overall economic outlook our endusers may change their decision or change the timing of their decision to develop build purchase or install a pv system in addition we believe that a significant percentage of our endusers install pv systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt an increase in interest rates andor lending rates could lower an investor’s return on investment in a pv system increase equity return requirements or make alternative investments more attractive relative to pv systems and in each case could cause these endusers to seek alternative investments a reduction in the supply of project debt financing or tax equity investments could reduce the number of solar projects that receive financing and thus lower demand for solar modules as described above under “item 1 business — sales and marketing — economic incentives” the 30 grant in lieu of the federal investment tax credit under the arra is set to expire and unless extended will not be available for solar installations that begin construction on or after january 1 2011 if such program is not extended total tax equity availability could be reduced which may adversely affect our ability to arrange financing for utilityscale projects and may adversely affect the attractiveness of the us solar market 

we currently sell a substantial portion of our solar modules under longterm supply contracts and we allocate a significant amount of our production to satisfy our obligations under these contracts these customers buy our modules with the expectation that they will be able to resell them in connection with the development of pv systems as discussed above many of these projects depend on the availability of debt and equity financing a prolonged material disruption to the supply of project finance could adversely affect our customers’ ability to perform under these agreements in the event of default by one or more of these customers we may be unable to sell these modules at the prices specified in our longterm supply contracts especially if demand for pv systems softens or supply of solar modules increases also we may decide to lower our average selling price to certain customers in certain markets in response to changes in economic circumstances of our customers their end markets or the capital markets see “item 1 business — segment information — components business — customers” for a description of previous pricing adjustments under our longterm supply contracts 

page 15 

  

we currently depend on a limited number of customers with five customers accounting for a majority of our components business’ net sales last year the loss of or a significant reduction in orders from any of these customers could significantly reduce our net sales and negatively impact our operating results 

we currently sell substantially all of our solar modules to customers headquartered throughout the european union during 2009 our five largest customers for our components business each accounted for between 10 and 19 of our component business’ net sales our customer base within our components business is currently concentrated to a significant extent in germany and therefore the likely additional german feedin tariff reductions currently under discussion could reduce demand andor price levels for our modules sold to these customers the loss of any of our large customers their inability to perform under their contracts or their default in payment could significantly reduce our net sales and adversely impact our operating results our customers face significant challenges under current economic conditions including lack of capital to finance solar projects and rising costs associated with leasing or otherwise acquiring land and rooftops for solar projects we believe that we can mitigate this risk by reallocating modules to other customers if the need arises but we may be unable in whole or in part to mitigate the reduced demand for our modules in the event that we determine that our planned production of solar modules exceeds the demand we anticipate we may decide to reduce or halt production of solar modules in our manufacturing facilities however we may be unable to anticipate and respond to the oversupply of solar modules because we have limited visibility into our customers’ inventories 

 

risks related to regulations 

existing regulations and policies and changes to these regulations and policies may present technical regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of photovoltaic products which may significantly reduce demand for our solar modules 

the market for electricity generation products is heavily influenced by foreign federal state and local government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry as well as policies promulgated by electric utilities these regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customerowned electricity generation in the united states and in a number of other countries these regulations and policies have been modified in the past and may be modified again in the future these regulations and policies could deter enduser purchases of photovoltaic products and investment in the research and development of photovoltaic technology for example without a mandated regulatory exception for photovoltaic systems utility customers are often charged interconnection or standby fees for putting distributed power generation on the electric utility grid if these interconnection standby fees were applicable to pv systems it is likely that they would increase the cost to our endusers of using pv systems which could make them less desirable thereby harming our business prospects results of operations and financial condition in addition electricity generated by pv systems mostly competes with expensive peak hour electricity rather than the less expensive average price of electricity modifications to the peak hour pricing policies of utilities such as to a flat rate for all times of the day would require pv systems to achieve lower prices in order to compete with the price of electricity from other sources 

we anticipate that our solar modules and their installation will be subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with national and local ordinances relating to building codes safety environmental protection utility interconnection and metering and related matters it is difficult to track the requirements of individual states and design equipment to comply with the varying standards any new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to our solar modules may result in significant additional expenses to us our resellers and their customers and as a result could cause a significant reduction in demand for our solar modules 

environmental obligations and liabilities could have a substantial negative impact on our financial condition cash flows and profitability 

our operations involve the use handling generation processing storage transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations at the national state local and international level these environmental laws and regulations include those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the use management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites and occupational health and safety we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs and capital expenditures in complying with these laws and regulations in addition violations of or liabilities under environmental laws or permits may result in restrictions being imposed on our operating activities or in our being subjected to substantial fines penalties criminal proceedings third party property damage or personal injury claims cleanup costs or other costs while we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements future developments such as more aggressive enforcement policies the implementation of new more stringent laws and regulations or the discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

page 16 

  

in addition our products contain cadmium telluride and cadmium sulfide elemental cadmium and certain of its compounds are regulated as hazardous due to the adverse health effects that may arise from human exposure although the risks of exposure to cadmium telluride are not believed to be as serious as those relating to exposure to elemental cadmium the chemical physical and toxicological properties of cadmium telluride have not been thoroughly investigated and reported we maintain engineering controls to minimize our associates’ exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds and require our associates who handle cadmium compounds to follow certain safety procedures including the use of personal protective equipment such as respirators chemical goggles and protective clothing in addition we believe the risk of exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds from our endproducts is limited by the fully encapsulated nature of these materials in our products the physical properties of cadmium compounds used in our products and the implementation in 2005 of our collection and recycling program for our solar modules while we believe that these factors and procedures are sufficient to protect our associates endusers and the general public from cadmium exposure we cannot assure that human or environmental exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds used in our products will not occur any such exposure could result in future thirdparty claims against us as well as damage to our reputation and heightened regulatory scrutiny of our products which could limit or impair our ability to sell and distribute our products the occurrence of future events such as these could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the use of cadmium in various products is also coming under increasingly stringent governmental regulation future regulation in this area could impact the manufacture sale collection and recycling of solar modules and could require us to make unforeseen environmental expenditures or limit our ability to sell and distribute our products for example european union directive 200295ec on the restriction of the use of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment rohs directive restricts the use of certain hazardous substances including cadmium in specified products other jurisdictions such as china have adopted similar legislation or are considering doing so currently pv solar modules are not subject to the rohs directive however the rohs directive allows for future amendments subjecting additional products to the requirements and the scope applicability and the products included in the directive may also change in december 2008 the european commission issued its proposed revision of the rohs directive this proposed revision did not include photovoltaic solar modules in the scope of rohs but is now being amended by both the european parliament and the european union members states as part of the normal european union legislative process the european council and the european parliament are currently considering an “open scope” approach to the rohs directive under which all electrical and electronic equipment eee products would be included in the scope of the rohs directive unless specifically excluded or exempted from coverage as part of these discussions exclusion for pv panels from the rohs directive is being considered a final legislative agreement on the rohs directive is not expected until 2011 at the earliest if pv modules are included in the scope of rohs without an exemption or exclusion we would be required to redesign our solar modules to eliminate cadmium in order to continue to offer them for sale within the european union which would be impractical in such event the european union market would be in effect closed to us which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in 2009 86 of our total net sales were generated from module sales in the european union in addition some of our competitors are increasingly focusing on our modules’ use of cadmium telluride in an attempt to gain a competitive advantage over us if such actions are successful they could result in a loss of sales and potentially limit our growth 

 

risks related to our operations manufacturing and technology 

our limited operating history may not serve as an adequate basis to judge our future prospects and results of operations 

we have a limited operating history although we began developing our predecessor technology in 1987 we did not launch commercial operations until we qualified our pilot production line in january 2002 we qualified the first production line at our ohio plant in november 2004 the second and third production lines at our ohio plant in august 2006 our german plant in the third quarter of 2007 and our malaysian plants in 2008 and 2009 because these production lines have only been in operation for a limited period of time our historical operating results may not provide a meaningful basis for evaluating our business financial performance and prospects while our net sales grew from 1350 million in 2006 to 21 billion in 2009 we may be unable to achieve similar growth or grow at all in future periods our ability to achieve similar growth in future periods is also affected by current economic conditions our past results occurred in an environment where among other things capital was generally more accessible to our customers to finance the cost of developing solar projects and economic incentives for solar power in certain core markets such as the german feedin tariff were more favorable accordingly you should not rely on our results of operations for any prior period as an indication of our future performance see “item 1 business — segment information — components business — customers” for a description of previous pricing adjustments under our longterm supply contracts 

we face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules thin film solar modules and solar thermal and concentrated photovoltaic systems if global supply exceeds global demand it could lead to a reduction in the average selling price for photovoltaic modules 

the solar energy and renewable energy industries are both highly competitive and continually evolving as participants strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete with the larger electric power industry within the global photovoltaic industry we face competition from crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers other thin film solar module manufacturers and companies developing solar thermal and concentrated photovoltaic technologies 

page 17 

  

even if demand for solar modules continues to grow the rapid expansion plans of many solar cell and module manufacturers could create periods where supply exceeds demand in addition we believe the significant decrease in the cost of silicon feedstock will provide significant reductions in the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules and lead to pricing pressure for solar modules and potentially the oversupply of solar modules including in key markets such as germany and spain 

during any such period our competitors could decide to reduce their sales price in response to competition even below their manufacturing cost in order to generate sales as a result we may be unable to sell our solar modules at attractive prices or for a profit during any period of excess supply of solar modules which would reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations also we may decide to lower our average selling price to certain customers in certain markets in response to competition 

thin film technology has a short history and our thin film technology and solar modules may perform below expectations problems with product quality or performance may cause us to incur warranty expenses damage our market reputation and prevent us from maintaining or increasing our market share 

researchers began developing thin film semiconductor technology over 20 years ago but were unable to integrate the technology into a solar module production line until recently our oldest active production line has been in operation since november 2004 and the oldest solar modules manufactured during the qualification of our pilot line have been in use since 2001 as a result our thin film technology and solar modules do not have a sufficient operating history to confirm how our solar modules will perform over their estimated 25year useful life we perform a variety of quality and life tests under different conditions however if our thin film technology and solar modules perform below expectations we could lose customers and face substantial warranty expense 

our solar modules are sold with a fiveyear materials and workmanship warranty for technical defects and a 25year warranty against declines of more than 10 of their initial rated power in the first 10 years following their installation and 20 of initial rated power in the following 15 years respectively as a result we bear the risk of extensive warranty claims long after we have sold our solar modules and recognized net sales as of december 26 2009 our accrued warranty liability was 226 million of which 82 million was classified as current and 144 million was classified as noncurrent 

 

while our power output warranty extends for 25 years our oldest solar modules manufactured during the qualification of our pilot production line have only been in use since 2001 because of the limited operating history of our solar modules we have been required to make assumptions regarding the durability and reliability of our solar modules our assumptions could prove to be materially different from the actual performance of our solar modules causing us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective solar modules in the future for example our glassonglass solar modules could break delaminate or experience power degradation in excess of expectations our manufacturing operations could be subject to process variations that could cause affected modules to underperform compared to our expectations any widespread product failures may damage our market reputation and cause our sales to decline and require us to repair or replace the defective modules which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

if our estimates regarding the future cost of collecting and recycling our solar modules are incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses at and from the time we realize our estimates are incorrect and face a significant unplanned cash burden 

we prefund our estimated future obligation for collecting and recycling our solar modules based on the present value of the expected future cost of collecting and recycling the modules which includes the cost of packaging the solar modules for transport the cost of freight from the solar module’s installation site to a recycling center the material labor and capital costs of the recycling process and an estimated thirdparty profit margin and return on risk for collection and recycling we base our estimate on our experience collecting and recycling solar modules that do not pass our quality control tests and solar modules returned under our warranty and on our expectations about future developments in recycling technologies and processes and economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled if our estimates prove incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses at and from the time we realize our estimates are incorrect and also face a significant unplanned cash burden at the time we realize our estimates are incorrect or endusers return their solar modules which could harm our operating results in addition our endusers can return their solar modules at any time as a result we could be required to collect and recycle our solar modules earlier than we expect and before recycling technologies and processes improve 

page 18 

  

our failure to further refine our technology and develop and introduce improved photovoltaic products could render our solar modules uncompetitive or obsolete and reduce our net sales and market share 

we will need to invest significant financial resources in research and development to continue to improve our module conversion efficiency and to otherwise keep pace with technological advances in the solar energy industry however research and development activities are inherently uncertain and we could encounter practical difficulties in commercializing our research results we seek to continuously improve our products and processes and the resulting changes carry potential risks in the form of delays additional costs or other unintended contingencies in addition our significant expenditures on research and development may not produce corresponding benefits other companies are developing a variety of competing photovoltaic technologies including copper indium gallium diselenide and amorphous silicon which could produce solar modules that prove more costeffective or have better performance than our solar modules in addition other companies could potentially develop a highly reliable renewable energy system that mitigates the intermittent power production drawback of many renewable energy systems or offers other valueadded improvements from the perspective of utilities and other system owners in which case such companies could compete with us even if the levelized cost of electricity associated with such new system is higher than that of our systems as a result our solar modules may be rendered obsolete by the technological advances of our competitors which could reduce our net sales and market share 

in addition we often forward price our products and services including through our longterm supply contracts and power purchase agreements in anticipation of future cost reductions and thus an inability to further refine our technology and execute our longterm cost reduction objectives could adversely affect our margins and operating results 

our failure to protect our intellectual property rights may undermine our competitive position and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against thirdparty allegations of infringement may be costly 

protection of our proprietary processes methods and other technology is critical to our business failure to protect and monitor the use of our existing intellectual property rights could result in the loss of valuable technologies we rely primarily on patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property as of december 26 2009 we held 22 patents in the united states which will expire at various times between 2012 and 2026 and had 96 patent applications pending we also held 28 patents and had over 100 patent applications pending in foreign jurisdictions our existing patents and future patents could be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents or if patents are issued to us such patents may not be sufficient to provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies 

we also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our associates and third parties to protect our intellectual property such confidentiality agreements are limited in duration and could be breached and may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary manufacturing expertise adequate remedies may not be available in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise in addition others may obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or legal means the failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes equipment technology trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise methods and compounds could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries especially any developing countries into which we may expand our operations in some countries we have not applied for patent trademark or copyright protection 

 

third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary technologies or other intellectual property rights which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology can be difficult and expensive also litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others we cannot assure you that the outcome of such potential litigation will be in our favor such litigation may be costly and may divert management attention and other resources away from our business an adverse determination in any such litigation may impair our intellectual property rights and may harm our business prospects and reputation in addition we have no insurance coverage against litigation costs and would have to bear all costs arising from such litigation to the extent we are unable to recover them from other parties 

page 19 

  

many of our key raw materials and components are either solesourced or sourced by a limited number of thirdparty suppliers and their failure to perform could cause manufacturing delays and impair our ability to deliver solar modules to customers in the required quality and quantities and at a price that is profitable to us 

our failure to obtain raw materials and components that meet our quality quantity and cost requirements in a timely manner could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture our solar modules or increase our manufacturing cost many of our key raw materials and components are either solesourced or sourced by a limited number of thirdparty suppliers as a result the failure of any of our suppliers to perform could disrupt our supply chain and impair our operations in addition many of our suppliers are small companies that may be unable to supply our increasing demand for raw materials and components as we implement our planned rapid expansion we may be unable to identify new suppliers or qualify their products for use on our production lines in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms raw materials and components from new suppliers may also be less suited for our technology and yield solar modules with lower conversion efficiencies higher failure rates and higher rates of degradation than solar modules manufactured with the raw materials from our current suppliers a constraint on our production may cause us to be unable to meet our obligations under our longterm supply contracts which would have an adverse impact on our financial results 

a disruption in our supply chain for cadmium telluride our semiconductor material could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture solar modules 

a key raw material we use in our production process is a cadmium telluride compound tellurium is mainly produced as a byproduct of copper refining and its supply is therefore largely dependent upon demand for copper currently we purchase these raw materials from a limited number of suppliers if our current suppliers or any of our future suppliers are unable to perform under their contracts or purchase orders our operations could be interrupted or impaired in addition because our suppliers must undergo a lengthy qualification process we may be unable to replace a lost supplier in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms our supply of cadmium telluride could also be limited if any of our current suppliers or any of our future suppliers are unable to acquire an adequate supply of tellurium in a timely manner or at commercially reasonable prices if our competitors begin to use or increase their demand for cadmium telluride supply could be reduced and prices could increase if our current suppliers or any of our future suppliers cannot obtain sufficient tellurium they could substantially increase prices or be unable to perform under their contracts we may be unable to pass increases in the cost of our raw materials through to our customers because our customer contracts do not adjust for raw material price increases and are generally for a longer term than our raw material supply contracts a reduction in our production could result in our inability to meet our commitments under our longterm supply contracts all of which would have an adverse impact on our financial results 

 

our future success depends on our ability to build new manufacturing plants and add production lines in a costeffective manner both of which are subject to risks and uncertainties 

our future success depends on our ability to significantly increase both our manufacturing capacity and production throughput in a costeffective and efficient manner if we cannot do so we may be unable to expand our business decrease our cost per watt maintain our competitive position satisfy our contractual obligations or sustain profitability our ability to expand production capacity is subject to significant risks and uncertainties including the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

page 20 

  

if our future production lines are not built in line with our committed schedules it may impair our growth plans if our future production lines do not achieve operating metrics similar to our existing production lines our solar modules could perform below expectations and cause us to lose customers 

currently our production lines have a limited history of operating at full capacity future production lines could produce solar modules that have lower efficiencies higher failure rates and higher rates of degradation than solar modules from our existing production lines and we could be unable to determine the cause of the lower operating metrics or develop and implement solutions to improve performance although we will be using the same systematic replication process to build our french manufacturing center and expand our malaysian manufacturing center that we successfully used when building and expanding our existing german and malaysian production facilities our replication risk in connection with building production lines at our french manufacturing center and other future manufacturing plants could be higher than our replication risk was in building and expanding our existing german and malaysian production facilities because two of these new production lines are located in a new geographic area for us which could entail other factors that may lower their operating metrics if we are unable to systematically replicate our production lines to meet our committed schedules and achieve and sustain similar operating metrics in our future production lines as we have achieved at our existing production lines our manufacturing capacity could be substantially constrained our manufacturing costs per watt could increase and this may impair our growth plans andor cause us to lose customers resulting in lower net sales higher liabilities and lower net income than we anticipate in addition we might be unable to produce enough solar modules to satisfy our contractual requirements under our longterm supply contracts 

some of our manufacturing equipment is customized and sole sourced if our manufacturing equipment fails or if our equipment suppliers fail to perform under their contracts we could experience production disruptions and be unable to satisfy our contractual requirements 

some of our manufacturing equipment is customized to our production lines based on designs or specifications that we provide to the equipment manufacturer which then undertakes a specialized process to manufacture the custom equipment as a result the equipment is not readily available from multiple vendors and would be difficult to repair or replace if it were to become damaged or stop working if any piece of equipment fails production along the entire production line could be interrupted and we could be unable to produce enough solar modules to satisfy our contractual requirements under our longterm supply contracts in addition the failure of our equipment suppliers to supply equipment in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms could delay our expansion plans and otherwise disrupt our production schedule or increase our manufacturing costs all of which would adversely impact our financial results 

if we are unable to further increase the number of sellable watts per solar module and reduce our manufacturing cost per watt we will be in default under certain of our longterm supply contracts and our profitability could decline 

our longterm supply contracts either 1 require us to increase the minimum average number of watts per module over the term of the contract or 2 have a price adjustment for increases or decreases in the number of watts per module relative to a base number of watts per module our failure to achieve these metrics could reduce our profitability or allow some of our customers to terminate their contracts in addition all of our longterm supply contracts in europe specify a sales price per watt that declines at the beginning of each year through the expiration date of each contract in 2012 our profitability could decline if we are unable to reduce our manufacturing cost per watt by at least the same rate at which our contractual prices decrease furthermore our failure to reduce cost per watt by increasing our efficiency may impair our ability to enter new markets that we believe will require lower cost per watt for us to be competitive and may impair our growth plans 

we may be unable to manage the expansion of our operations effectively 

we expect to continue to expand our business in order to meet our contractual obligations satisfy demand for our solar modules and maintain or increase market share however depending on the amount of additional contractual obligations we enter into and our ability to expand our manufacturing capabilities in accordance with our expectations we might be unable to produce enough solar modules to satisfy our contractual requirements under our longterm supply contracts and other commitments in which case we could be in default under such agreements and our operating results may be adversely affected 

following the completion of our expansion of our ohio plant in 2010 we will have grown from one production line in ohio in 2005 to 24 production lines with an annual global manufacturing capacity of approximately 1282mw based on the fourth quarter of 2009 average per line run rate at our existing plants construction of our twoline french manufacturing facility is expected to begin in the second half of 2010 and a full annual production capacity of more than 100mw is expected to be reached in early 2012 our eightline malaysian expansion is expected to start production in the first half of 2011 

page 21 

  

to manage the continued rapid expansion of our operations we will be required to continue to improve our operational and financial systems procedures and controls and expand train and manage our growing associate base our management will also be required to maintain and expand our relationships with customers suppliers and other third parties and attract new customers and suppliers in addition our current and planned operations personnel systems and internal procedures and controls might be inadequate to support our future growth if we cannot manage our growth effectively we may be unable to take advantage of market opportunities execute our business strategies or respond to competitive pressures 

implementing a new enterprise resource planning system could interfere with our business or operations and could adversely impact our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

we are in the process of implementing a new enterprise resource planning erp system we expect to complete phase 1 of this implementation in the second half of 2010 this project requires significant investment of capital and human resources the reengineering of many processes of our business and the attention of many associates and managers who would otherwise be focused on other aspects of our business any disruptions delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of the new erp system could result in potentially much higher costs than we had anticipated and could adversely affect our ability to process customer orders ship products provide services and support to customers bill and track our customers fulfill contractual obligations file sec reports in a timely manner andor otherwise operate our business or otherwise impact our controls environment and any of these consequences could have an adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

our substantial international operations subject us to a number of risks including unfavorable political regulatory labor and tax conditions in foreign countries 

we have significant marketing distribution and manufacturing operations both within and outside the united states in 2009 86 of our net sales were generated from customers headquartered in the european union in the future we expect to expand our operations into china india and other countries in europe asia and the middle east and elsewhere as a result we will be subject to the legal political social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions risks inherent to international operations include but are not limited to the following 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

page 22 

  

 

 

 

 

our business in foreign markets requires us to respond to rapid changes in market conditions in these countries our overall success as a global business depends in part on our ability to succeed in differing legal regulatory economic social and political conditions we may not be able to develop and implement policies and strategies that will be effective in each location where we do business 

risks related to our systems business 

project development or construction activities may not be successful and projects under development may not receive required permits or construction may not commence as scheduled which could increase our costs and impair our ability to recover our investments 

the development and construction of solar power electric generation facilities and other energy infrastructure projects involve numerous risks we may be required to spend significant sums for preliminary engineering permitting legal and other expenses before we can determine whether a project is feasible economically attractive or capable of being built success in developing a particular project is contingent upon among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

successful completion of a particular project may be adversely affected by numerous factors including 

 

 

 

 

page 23 

  

 

 

 

 

 

if we are unable to complete the development of a solar power facility or fail to meet one or more agreed target construction milestone dates we may be subject to liquidated damages andor penalties under the epc agreement or other agreements relating to the project and we typically will not be able to recover our investment in the project some of these investments are included as assets on our balance under the line item “project assets” if we are unable to complete the development of a solar power project we may writedown or writeoff some or all of these capitalized investments which would have an adverse impact on our net income in the period in which the loss is recognized in 2010 we expect to invest a significant amount of capital to develop projects owned by us or third parties 

we may enter into fixed price epc contracts in which we act as the general contractor for our customers in connection with the installation of our solar power systems all essential costs are estimated at the time of entering into the epc contract for a particular project and these are reflected in the overall price that we charge our customers for the project these cost estimates are preliminary and may or may not be covered by contracts between us or the subcontractors suppliers and other parties to the project in addition we require qualified licensed subcontractors to install most of our systems shortages of such skilled labor could significantly delay a project or otherwise increase our costs should miscalculations in planning a project or delays in execution occur and we are unable to increase commensurately the epc sales price we may not achieve our expected margins or we may be required to record a loss in the relevant fiscal period 

we may be unable to acquire or lease land andor obtain the approvals licenses and permits necessary to build and operate pv power plants in a timely and cost effective manner and regulatory agencies local communities or labor unions may delay prevent or increase the cost of construction and operation of the pv plants we intend to build 

in order to construct and operate our pv plants we need to acquire or lease land and obtain all necessary local county state and federal approvals licenses and permits we may be unable to acquire the land or lease interests needed may not receive or retain the requisite approvals permits and licenses or may encounter other problems which could delay or prevent us from successfully constructing and operating pv plants for instance the california independent system operator has recently modified its transmission interconnection rules phasing out a serial process in favor of a cluster process for new projects and may further modify its rules in a manner that could negatively impact our favorable position in transmission queues certain of our california projects under development will remain subject to the serial process while other projects in earlier stages of development as well as new projects on a goingforward basis will be subject to the cluster process although the transition to the cluster process is still evolving and its ultimate impact is not yet fully known our project transmission cost could be materially higher than previously estimated under the serial process and our projects could be delayed or subject to transmission planning timing uncertainties we also may be required to post interconnection deposits which may not be refundable sooner than previously estimated under the serial process 

many of our proposed pv plants are located on or require access through public lands administered by federal and state agencies pursuant to competitive public leasing and rightofway procedures and processes the authorization for the use construction and operation of pv plants and associated transmission facilities on federal state and private lands will also require the assessment and evaluation of mineral rights private rightsofway and other easements environmental agricultural cultural recreational and aesthetic impacts and the likely mitigation of adverse impacts to these and other resources and uses the inability to obtain the required permits and potentially excessive delay in obtaining such permits due for example to litigation could prevent us from successfully constructing and operating pv plants and could result in a potential forfeiture of any deposit we have made with respect to a given project moreover project approvals subject to project modifications and conditions including mitigation requirements and costs could affect the financial success of a given project 

in addition local labor unions may increase the cost of andor lower the productivity of project development in canada and california 

in china our projects are subject to a number of government approvals including the approval of a prefeasibility and feasibility study individually the prefeasibility and feasibility study require many different government approvals at the national provincial and local levels and the approval process is discretionary and not fully transparent 

page 24 

  

lack of transmission capacity availability potential upgrade costs to the transmission grid and other systems constraints could significantly impact our ability to build pv plants and generate solar electricity power sales 

  

in order to deliver electricity from our pv plants to our customers our projects need to connect to the transmission grid the lack of available capacity on the transmission grid could substantially impact our projects and cause reductions in project size delays in project implementation increases in costs from transmission upgrades and potential forfeitures of any deposit we have made with respect to a given project these transmission issues as well as issues relating to the availability of large systems such as transformers and switch gear could significantly impact our ability to build pv plants and generate solar electricity sales 

  

our systems business is largely dependent on us and third parties arranging financing from various sources which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms or in insufficient amounts 

  

the construction of our large utilityscale solar power projects under development by us is expected in many cases to require project financing including nonrecourse project debt financing in the bank loan market and institutional debt capital markets uncertainties exist as to whether our projects will be able to access the debt markets in a sufficient magnitude to finance their construction if we are unable to arrange such financing or if it is only available on unfavorable terms we may be unable to fully execute our systems business plan in addition we generally expect to sell our projects by raising project equity capital from tax oriented strategic industry and other equity investors such equity sources may not be available or may only be available in insufficient amounts in which case our ability to sell our projects may be delayed or limited and our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected 

  

in addition for projects in which we provide epc services but are not the project developer our epc activities are in many cases dependent on the ability of third parties to purchase our pv plant projects which in turn is dependent on their ability to obtain financing for such purchases depending on prevailing conditions in the credit markets and other factors such financing may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms or in insufficient amounts if third parties are limited in their ability to access financing to support their purchase of pv power plant projects from us we may not realize the cash flows that we expect from such sales and this could adversely affect our ability to invest in our business andor generate revenue see also the risk factor above entitled “ an increase in interest rates or lending rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets including a reduction in total tax equity availability could make it difficult for endusers to finance the cost of a pv system and could reduce the demand for our solar modules andor lead to a reduction in the average selling price for photovoltaic modules ” 

 

developing solar power projects may require significant upfront investment prior to the signing of a power purchase agreement or an epc contract which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

  

our solar power project development cycles which span the time between the identification of land and the commercial operation of a pv power plant project vary substantially and can take many months or years to mature as a result of these long project cycles we may need to make significant upfront investments of resources including for example large transmission deposits or other payments which may be nonrefundable in advance of the signing of ppas and epc contracts and the receipt of any revenue much of which is not recognized for several additional months or years following contract signing our potential inability to enter into sales contracts with potential customers after making such upfront investments could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our liquidity may be adversely affected to the extent the project sale market weakens and we are unable to sell our solar projects on pricing terms and timing commercially acceptable to us 

other risks 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions and integration of these acquisitions may disrupt our business and management 

in april 2009 we acquired the solar power project development business of optisolar inc and in the future we may acquire additional companies project pipelines products or technologies or enter into joint ventures or other strategic initiatives we may not realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition and each acquisition has numerous risks these risks include the following

mergers and acquisitions of companies are inherently risky and ultimately if we do not complete the integration of acquired businesses successfully and in a timely manner we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions to the extent anticipated which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our future success depends on our ability to retain our key associates and to successfully integrate them into our management team 

we are dependent on the services of michael j ahearn our executive chairman robert j gillette our chief executive officer bruce sohn our president jens meyerhoff our chief financial officer mary beth gustafsson our executive vice president general counsel and corporate secretary carol campbell our executive vice president human resources tk kallenbach our executive vice president marketing and product management david eaglesham our chief technology officer and james zhu our chief accounting officer and other members of our senior management team the loss of ahearn gillette sohn meyerhoff gustafsson campbell kallenbach eaglesham zhu or any other member of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on us there is a risk that we will not be able to retain or replace these key associates several of our current key associates including ahearn gillette sohn meyerhoff gustafsson campbell kallenbach eaglesham and zhu are subject to employment conditions or arrangements that contain postemployment noncompetition provisions however these arrangements permit the associates to terminate their employment with us upon little or no notice and the enforceability of the noncompetition provisions is uncertain 

page 26 

  

if we are unable to attract train and retain key personnel our business may be materially and adversely affected 

our future success depends to a significant extent on our ability to attract train and retain management operations and technical personnel recruiting and retaining capable personnel particularly those with expertise in the photovoltaic industry and thin film technology are vital to our success there is substantial competition for qualified technical personnel and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain our technical personnel if we are unable to attract and retain qualified associates our business may be materially and adversely affected 

we may be exposed to infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties which if determined adversely to us could cause us to pay significant damage awards or prohibit us from the manufacture and sale of our solar modules or the use of our technology 

our success depends largely on our ability to use and develop our technology and knowhow without infringing or misappropriating the intellectual property rights of third parties the validity and scope of claims relating to photovoltaic technology patents involve complex scientific legal and factual considerations and analysis and therefore may be highly uncertain we may be subject to litigation involving claims of patent infringement or violation of intellectual property rights of third parties the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits patent opposition proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings can be both costly and time consuming and may significantly divert the efforts and resources of our technical and management personnel an adverse determination in any such litigation or proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liability to third parties require us to seek licenses from third parties which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all or pay ongoing royalties require us to redesign our solar module or subject us to injunctions prohibiting the manufacture and sale of our solar modules or the use of our technologies protracted litigation could also result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of our solar modules until the resolution of such litigation 

currency translation and transaction risk may negatively affect our net sales cost of sales and gross margins and could result in exchange losses 

although our reporting currency is the us dollar we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most countries in which we operate as a result we are subject to currency translation and transaction risk for example 86 and 95 of our net sales were denominated in euro for the years ended december 26 2009 and december 27 2008 respectively and we expect a large percentage of our net sales to be outside the united states and denominated in foreign currencies in the future in addition our operating expenses for our plants located outside the us currently germany and malaysia and our operations for our systems business in canada and other european countries will be denominated in the local currency changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar could affect our net sales and cost of sales and could result in exchange gains or losses for example the weakening of the euro reduced our net sales by 1161 million during fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 in addition we incur currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from our reporting currency for example our european longterm supply contracts specify fixed pricing in euros through 2012 and do not adjust for changes in the us dollar to euro exchange rate we cannot accurately predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations 

we could also expand our business into emerging markets many of which have an uncertain regulatory environment relating to currency policy conducting business in such emerging markets could cause our exposure to changes in exchange rates to increase 

our ability to hedge foreign currency exposure is dependent on our credit profile with the banks that are willing and able to do business with us deterioration in our credit position or a significant tightening of the credit market conditions could limit our ability to hedge our foreign currency exposure and therefore result in exchange losses 

the estate of john t walton and its affiliates have significant control over us and their interests may conflict with or differ from interests of other stockholders 

our largest stockholder the estate of john t walton and its affiliates including jcl holdings llc and jtw trust no 1 uad 91902 collectively the estate owned approximately 35 of our outstanding common stock at december 31 2009 as a result the estate has substantial influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of our directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions such as mergers tender offers and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets the interests of the estate could conflict with or differ from interests of other stockholders for example the concentration of ownership held by the estate could delay defer or prevent a change of control of our company or impede a merger takeover or other business combination which a majority of stockholders may view favorably 

if our goodwill investment in a related party or project assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 

we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements should we determine that our goodwill investment in a related party or project assets are impaired such a charge might have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 

page 27 

  

as required by accounting rules we review our goodwill investment in a related party and project assets for impairment when events or changes in our business or circumstances indicate that their fair value might be less than their carrying value factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill might not be recoverable include a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization a significant decline in projections of future cash flows and significantly slower growth rates in our industry we are also required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually we would write down project assets which are capitalized on the balance sheet for certain solar power projects should we determine that the project is not commercially viable 

unanticipated changes in our tax provisions the adoption of a new us tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge for inventory services licenses funding and other items in intercompany transactions we are subject to potential tax examinations in these various jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges crossjurisdictional transfer pricing or other tax positions and assess additional taxes we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these examinations in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these potential examinations and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of examinations could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision net income and cash flows in addition our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure loss of our malaysian tax holiday changes in the mix of earnings in countries with tax holidays or differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process in addition president obamas administration has recently announced proposals for new us tax legislation that if adopted could adversely affect our tax rate any of these changes could affect our results of operations 

our credit agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business 

we may be unable to respond to changes in business and economic conditions engage in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us and obtain additional financing if needed because our revolving credit agreement with jpmorgan chase and our malaysian facility agreement contain and any of our other future debt agreements may contain covenant restrictions that limit our ability to among other things 

 

 

 

 

 

under our revolving credit facility with jpmorgan chase and our malaysian facility agreement we are also subject to certain financial condition covenants our ability to comply with covenants under our credit agreements is dependent on our future performance which will be subject to many factors some of which are beyond our control including prevailing economic conditions in addition our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under these agreements and any of our other future debt agreements which could permit the holders thereof to accelerate such debt if any of our debt is accelerated we may in the future not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt which could materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operation

overview 

we manufacture and sell solar modules with an advanced thin film semiconductor technology and we design construct and sell photovoltaic pv solar power systems 

  

in furtherance of our goal of delivering the lowest cost of solar energy and achieving price parity with conventional fossilfuel based peak electricity generation we are continually focused on reducing pv system costs in three primary areas module manufacturing balance of system bos costs consisting of costs of components of a solar power system other than the solar modules including inverters mounting hardware grid interconnection equipment wiring and other devices and installation labor costs and cost of capital first with respect to our module manufacturing costs our advanced technology has allowed us to reduce our average module manufacturing costs to the lowest in the world based on publicly available information in 2009 our total average manufacturing costs were 087 per watt which we believe is significantly less than those of traditional crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers by continuing to improve conversion efficiency and line throughput lower material cost and drive volume scale to further decrease overhead costs we believe that we can further reduce our manufacturing costs per watt and maintain our cost advantage over traditional crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers second by continuing to improve conversion efficiency leverage volume procurement around standardized hardware platforms and accelerate installation time we believe we can continue to make substantial reductions in bos costs which represent over half of all costs associated with a typical utilityscale pv solar power system finally we believe that continuing to strengthen our financial position including our balance sheet and credit profile will enable us to continue to lower the cost of capital associated with our solar power systems thereby further enhancing the economic viability of our projects and lowering the cost of electricity generated by solar power systems which incorporate our modules and technology 

page 35 

  

we believe that combining our reliable low cost module manufacturing capability with our systems business enables us to more rapidly reduce the price of solar electricity to accelerate the adoption of our technology in large scale systems and to further our mission to create enduring value by enabling a world powered by clean affordable solar electricity 

on february 22 2006 we were incorporated as a delaware corporation prior to that date we operated as a delaware limited liability company 

our fiscal year ends on the saturday on or before december 31 all references to fiscal year 2009 relate to the 52 weeks ended december 26 2009 all references to fiscal year 2008 relate to the 52 weeks ended december 27 2008 and all references to fiscal year 2007 relate to the 52 weeks ended december 29 2007 we use a 13 week fiscal quarter 

manufacturing capacity 

as of december 26 2009 we operated 23 production lines with an annual global manufacturing capacity of approximately 1228mw based on the fourth quarter of 2009 average per line run rate at our existing plants at our manufacturing plants in perrysburg ohio frankfurtoder germany and kulim malaysia we expect to add an additional production line to our perrysburg ohio manufacturing facility in 2010 resulting in a 534mw increase in manufacturing capacity based on the fourth quarter of 2009 average per line run rate at our existing plants we expect to increase our manufacturing capacity to 34 production lines by 2012 with an annual global manufacturing capacity of approximately 18gw based on the fourth quarter of 2009 average per line run rate at our existing plants 

market overview 

we project the global market for pv solar modules to have a 35 compound annual growth rate through 2012 increasing demand to approximately 12gw worldwide we expect approximately 75gw of global demand in 2010 in addressing a growing global need for pv solar electricity we target markets with varying approaches depending on the underlying economics market requirements and distribution channels in subsidized feedin tariff markets such as germany we have historically sold most of solar modules to solar project developers system integrators and independent power producers in other markets such as the united states the demand for solar has been primarily driven by renewable portfolio standards requiring regulated utilities to supply a portion of their total electricity from renewable energy sources such as solar power to meet the needs of these markets and enable balance of system cost reductions we have developed a fully integrated systems business that can provide a lowcost turnkey utilityscale pv system solution for system owners and low cost electricity to utility endusers by building a fully integrated systems business we believe we are in position to expand our business in transitional and eventually economically sustainable markets in which subsidies or incentives are minimal that are expected to develop in areas with abundant solar resources and sizable electricity demand such as the united states china india and parts of europe in the longterm we plan on competing on an economic basis with conventional fossil fuelbased peaking power generation 

in 2009 the solar industry moved from a supply driven to a demand driven environment with increasing competitive pressure as the photovoltaic industry’s total manufacturing capacity to produce solar modules exceeded demand for those products we expect that the photovoltaic industry’s total manufacturing capacity to produce solar modules will continue to exceed demand in 2010 our customers faced significant challenges under the prevailing economic conditions including tight liquidity and extended cash realization cycles weakened balance sheets constrained working capital a volatile pricing environment leading to deferred project equity investments constrained project finance outside of germany and capital preservation within us utilities during the year we extended our payment terms with certain customers from 10 days to 45 days from the date of invoice and reduced prices under our longterm contracts in response to the economic conditions 

during the second half of 2009 german installation activity was stronger than in the first half of 2009 driven by a combination of anticipation of reduced 2010 german feedin tariffs seasonal demand customer participation in our rebate program and improving project finance tax equity and corporate finance conditions the first half of 2009 in comparison had been characterized by project and channel competition with aggressive crystalline silicon module pricing deferred project equity investment based on anticipation of further reductions project debt constraints and delays and construction financing delays 

to the extent the challenging conditions mentioned above return as seasonal strength subsides our results of operations could be adversely affected by declines in the selling prices of our modules decreases in sales volumes of our modules andor increases in our solar module inventories we expect that demand for our solar modules in germany in the first half of 2010 will increase due to the uncertainty around the german subsidies the german feedin tariffs are currently under review by the government and certain proposals under discussion would further reduce these tariffs in the second quarter and later dates in 2010 

page 36 

  

in 2009 we continued to expand into certain key transition markets such as the united states within which affordable solar electricity solutions could be developed and ultimately evolve into economically sustainable markets our acquisition of the project development business of optisolar inc in april 2009 furthered our development of solar electricity solutions for utility companies in the united states that are seeking costeffective renewable energy solutions for the purpose of meeting renewable portfolio standard requirements in january 2010 we completed the acquisition of certain assets from edison mission groups solar project development pipeline consisting of utilityscale solar projects located primarily on private land in california and the southwestern united states 

in the pv module segment we face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules and other types of solar modules and photovoltaic systems solar module manufacturers compete with one another in several product performance attributes including reliability module cost per watt and levelized cost of electricity lcoe meaning the net present value of total life cycle costs of the solar power project divided by the quantity of energy which is expected to be produced over the system’s life we are the lowest cost pv module manufacturer in the solar industry based on publicly available information as evidenced by the further reduction in our average manufacturing cost per watt from 123 during 2007 to 087 during 2009 this cost advantage is reflected in the price at which we sell our modules or fully integrated systems and enables our systems to compete favorably in respect of their lcoe our cost competitiveness is based in large part on our proprietary technology which enables conversion efficiency improvements and permits a continuous highly automated industrial manufacturing process our scale and our operational excellence in addition our modules use approximately 1 of the amount of semiconductor material that is used to manufacture traditional crystalline silicon solar modules the cost of polysilicon is a significant driver of the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules the current spot market price of polysilicon of approximately between 55 and 63 per kilogram kg enables us to remain one of the lowest cost module manufacturers in the solar industry however the timing and rate of decrease in the cost of silicon feedstock could lead to pricing pressure for solar modules although we are not a crystalline silicon module manufacturer we estimate based on industry research and public disclosures of our competitors that a 10 per kg increase or decrease in the price of polysilicon could increase or decrease respectively our competitors’ manufacturing cost per watt by approximately 007 given the lower conversion efficiency of our modules compared to crystalline silicon modules there are higher balanceofsystem costs associated with systems using our modules thus to compete effectively on the basis of lcoe our modules need to maintain a certain cost advantage per watt compared to crystalline silicon based modules our cost reduction roadmap anticipates manufacturing cost per watt reductions for our modules of 10 per year during the twelve months ended december 26 2009 we reduced our manufacturing cost per watt by 19 from our cost per watt in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 

while our modules currently enjoy competitive advantages in these product performance attributes there can be no guarantee that these advantages will continue to exist in the future to the same extent or at all any declines in the competitiveness of our products could result in margin compression a decline in average selling prices of our solar modules erosion in our market share for modules a decrease in the rate of revenue growth andor a decline in overall revenues we have taken and continue to take several actions to mitigate the potential impact resulting from competitive pressures including adjusting our pricing policies as necessary in core markets to drive module volumes continuously making progress along our cost reduction roadmap and focusing our research and development on increasing the conversion efficiency of our solar modules 

as we expand our systems business into transition and sustainable markets we can offer value beyond the pv module reduce our exposure to moduleonly competition and provide comprehensive utilityscale photovoltaic systems solutions that significantly reduce solar electricity costs thus our systems business allows us to play a more active role than many of our competitors in managing the demand for and manufacturing throughput of our solar modules finally we seek to form and develop strong partner relationships with our customers and continue to develop our range of offerings including epc capabilities and operating and maintenance services in order to enhance the competitiveness of systems using our solar modules 

financial operations overview 

the following describes certain line items in our statement of operations and some of the factors that affect our operating results 

net sales 

components business 

currently the majority of our net sales is generated from the sale of solar modules we currently price and sell our solar modules per watt of power as a result our net sales can fluctuate based on our output of sellable watts or price during 2009 we sold almost all of our solar modules to solar power system project developers system integrators and operators headquartered in germany france spain and italy which either resell our solar modules to endusers or integrate them into power plants that they own or operate or sell 

page 37 

  

as of december 26 2009 we had longterm supply contracts for the sale of solar modules expiring at the end of 2012 with fourteen european solar power system project developers and system integrators we also have an agreement expiring in 2013 with a solar power system project developer and system integrator in the united states which is a related party these contracts account for a significant portion of our planned production over the period from 2010 through 2012 and therefore will significantly affect our overall financial performance we have the right to terminate certain longterm supply contracts upon 12 months notice and the payment of a termination fee if we determine that certain material adverse changes have occurred in addition our customers are entitled to certain remedies in the event of missed deliveries of kilowatt volume these delivery commitments are established through rolling four quarter forecasts that are agreed to with each of the customers within the parameters established in the longterm supply contracts and define the specific quantities to be purchased on a quarterly basis and the schedules of the individual shipments to be made to the customers in the case of a late delivery certain of our customers are entitled to a maximum charge representing a percentage of the delinquent revenue if we do not meet our annual minimum volume shipments our customers also have the right to terminate these contracts on a prospective basis 

 

certain of our longterm supply contracts require us to deliver solar modules that in total meet or exceed specified minimum average number of watts per module for the year or specify an annual decline in the sales price per watt under these contracts as a result our profitability could decline if we are unable to reduce our manufacturing cost per watt by at least the same rate as the contractual sales prices decrease because the sales prices under our longterm supply contracts are fixed and have the builtin decline each year we cannot pass along any increases in manufacturing costs to these customers although we believe that our total manufacturing costs per watt will decline at the same rate or more rapidly than our prices under the longterm supply contracts our failure to achieve our manufacturing cost per watt targets could result in a reduction of our gross profit 

our sales prices under the longterm supply contracts are denominated in euro exposing us to risks from currency exchange rate fluctuations during the year ended december 26 2009 86 of our sales were denominated in euro and subject to fluctuation in the exchange rate between the euro and us dollar 

we have in the past amended pricing and other terms in our longterm supply contracts in order to remain competitive as described below and we may decide in the future to further amend these contracts in order to address the highly competitive environment for example during the three months ended march 28 2009 we amended our longterm supply contracts with certain customers to further reduce the sales price per watt under these contracts in 2009 and 2010 in exchange for increases in the volume of solar modules to be delivered under the contracts we also extended the payment terms for certain customers under these contracts from net 10 days to net 45 days to increase liquidity in our sales channel and to reflect longer module shipment times from our manufacturing plants in malaysia 

during the third quarter of 2009 we amended our longterm supply contracts with certain of our customers to implement a program which provides a price rebate to certain of these customers for solar modules purchased from us the intent of this program is to enable our customers to successfully compete in our core segments in germany the rebate program applies a specified rebate rate to solar modules sold for solar power projects in germany at the beginning of each quarter for the upcoming quarter the rebate program is subject to periodic review and we will adjust the rebate rate quarterly upward or downward as appropriate the rebate period commenced during the third quarter of 2009 and terminates at the end of the fourth quarter of 2010 customers need to meet certain requirements in order to be eligible for and benefit from this program 

we account for rebates as a reduction to the selling price of our solar modules and therefore as a reduction in revenue no rebates granted under this program can be claimed in cash and all rebates will be applied to reduce outstanding accounts receivable balances during the year ended december 26 2009 we extended rebates to customers in the amount of €871 million 1289 million at an average exchange rate of 148€100 

we also enter into onetime module sale agreements with customers for specific projects 

under our customer contracts we transfer title and risk of loss to the customer and recognize revenue upon shipment our customers do not have extended payment terms or rights of return under these contracts 

during 2009 principal customers of our components business were blitzstrom gmbh edf en development gehrlicher solar ag juwi solar gmbh and phoenix solar ag during 2009 each of these five customers individually accounted for between 10 and 19 of our component segment’s net sales all of our other customers individually accounted for less than 10 of our component business net sales during the year ended december 26 2009 

page 38 

  

systems business 

through our fully integrated systems business we provide a complete solar power system solution which includes project development epc services om services and when required project finance 

net sales from our systems segment are comprised of the following types of transactions 

 

 

during the year ended december 26 2009 net sales from our systems business resulted primarily from the sale of two utility scale solar power systems in the fourth fiscal quarter to utilities in the united states and canada our systems business does not currently meet the quantitative criteria for disclosures as a separate reporting segment on april 3 2009 we completed the acquisition of the solar power project development business of optisolar inc and we have integrated this business into our systems business 

net sales from our systems segment are impacted by numerous factors including the magnitude and effectiveness of renewable portfolio standards economic incentives such as european feedin tariffs or the federal investment tax credit in the united states and other pv system demand drivers 

for a given solar power project we recognize revenue for our systems business either after execution of an epc agreement with a third party specifying the terms and conditions of the construction of the solar power plant by applying the provisions for real estate accounting by applying the percentageofcompletion method of accounting or upon the sale of the complete system solution as appropriate for the particular facts and circumstances related to the project and its sale 

at any given point in time aggregate contracted sales amounts with respect to the systems segment generally consist of the uncompleted portion of contracted projects where we have entered into a definitive epc agreement with the customer 

cost of sales 

components business 

our cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials and components for manufacturing solar modules such as tempered back glass transparent conductive oxide coated front glass cadmium telluride laminate connector assemblies laminate edge seal and other items our cost of sales also includes direct labor for the manufacturing of solar modules and manufacturing overhead such as engineering expense equipment maintenance environmental health and safety expenses quality and production control and procurement cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing plants and equipment and facilityrelated expenses in addition we accrue warranty and solar module collection and recycling costs to our cost of sales 

page 39 

  

we implemented a program in 2005 to collect and recycle our solar modules after their use under our solar module collection and recycling program we enter into an agreement with the endusers of the solar power systems that use our solar modules in the agreement we commit at our expense to collect the solar modules from the installation site at the end of their useful life and transport them to a processing center where the solar module materials and components will be either refurbished and resold as used solar modules or recycled to recover some of the raw materials in return the owner agrees not to dispose of the solar modules except through our module collection and recycling program or any other program that we might approve of the owner is also responsible for disassembling the solar modules and packaging them in containers that we provide at the time we sell a solar module we record an expense in cost of sales equal to the fair value of the estimated future module collection and recycling obligation we subsequently record accretion expense on this future obligation which we classify within selling general and administrative expense 

 

overall we expect our cost of sales per watt to decrease over the next several years due to an increase of sellable watts per solar module an increase in unit output per production line continued geographic expansion into lowercost manufacturing regions and more efficient absorption of fixed costs driven by economies of scale 

systems business 

within our systems business projectrelated costs include standard epc costs consisting primarily of balance of system costs for inverters electrical and mounting hardware project management and engineering costs and installation labor costs site specific costs and development costs including transmission upgrade costs interconnection fees and permitting costs as further described in note 22 “segment reporting” at the time when the revenue recognition criteria are met we include the sale of our solar modules manufactured by our components business and used by our systems business as net sales of our components business therefore the related cost of sales will also be included within our components business 

deferred project costs represent capitalized costs related to the deferred revenue for project development or project construction activities sold to a third party typically under an epc agreement for which the revenue recognition criteria have not been met we recognize these costs as we recognize the revenue for these projects deferred project costs at december 26 2009 and december 27 2008 were 367 million and 07 million respectively 

gross profit 

gross profit is affected by numerous factors including our average selling prices foreign exchange rates our manufacturing costs and the effective utilization of our production facilities gross profit is also subject to competitive pressures and we have in the past and may in the future decide to amend our longterm supply contracts which specify our sales price per watt other factors impacting gross profits are the ramp of production on new plants due to a reduced ability to absorb fixed costs until full production volumes are reached the mix of net sales generated by our components and systems businesses coupled with a geographic factor gross profit margin is affected by our systems business which generally operates at a lower gross profit margin due to the passthrough nature of certain balance of system components procured from third parties gross profit for our systems business excludes cost of sales for solar modules that are included in the gross profit of our components business 

research and development 

research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and personnelrelated costs and the cost of products materials and outside services used in our process and product research and development activities we acquire equipment for general use in further process developments and record the depreciation of this equipment as research and development expense 

we maintain a number of programs and activities to improve our technology and processes in order to enhance the performance and reduce the costs of our solar modules and pv systems using our modules we maintain active collaborations with the national renewable energy laboratory a division of the united states department of energy brookhaven national laboratory and several universities we report our research and development expense net of grant funding we received 09 million and 18 million of grant funding during the years ended december 27 2008 and december 29 2007 respectively that we applied towards our research and development programs we did not receive any grant funding during the year ended december 26 2009 we expect our research and development expense to increase in absolute terms in the future as we increase personnel and research and development activity over time we expect research and development expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as a result of economies of scale 

page 40 

  

selling general and administrative 

selling general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated costs professional fees insurance costs travel expense and other selling expenses we expect these expenses to increase in the near term both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales in order to support the growth of our business as we expand our sales and marketing efforts improve our information processes and systems and implement the financial reporting compliance and other infrastructure required for an expanding public company over time we expect selling general and administrative expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as our net sales and our total watts produced increase 

 

production startup 

production startup expense consists primarily of salaries and personnelrelated costs and the cost of operating a production line before it has been qualified for full production including the cost of raw materials for solar modules run through the production line during the qualification phase it also includes all expenses related to the selection of a new site and the related legal and regulatory costs and the costs to maintain our plant replication program to the extent we cannot capitalize these expenditures we incurred production startup expense of 169 million during the year ended december 29 2007 in connection with the qualification of our german plant and the planning and preparation of our plants at our malaysian manufacturing center we incurred production startup expense of 325 million during the year ended december 27 2008 in connection with the planning and preparation of our plants at the malaysian manufacturing center production startup expense for the year ended december 26 2009 was 139 million and related to plant four of our malaysian manufacturing center and our ohio plant expansion in general we expect production startup expense per production line to be higher when we build an entirely new manufacturing facility compared with the addition of new production lines at an existing manufacturing facility primarily due to the additional infrastructure investment required when building an entirely new facility over time we expect production startup expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as a result of economies of scale 

foreign currency gain loss 

foreign currency gain loss consists of gains and losses resulting from holding assets and liabilities and conducting transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies 

interest income 

interest income is earned on our cash cash equivalents marketable securities and restricted cash and investments 

interest expense net 

interest expense net of amounts capitalized is incurred on various debt financings 

income tax expense 

  

income taxes are imposed on our income by the taxing authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate principally the united states germany and malaysia the statutory federal tax rate in the united states is 35 while the tax rate in germany and malaysia is approximately 285 and 25 respectively in malaysia we have been granted a longterm tax holiday pursuant to which substantially all our income earned in malaysia is exempt from income tax

critical accounting estimates 

in preparing our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap we make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts of reported assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities in our financial statements and the related notes thereto some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in the selection of appropriate assumptions for making these estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty we base our judgments and estimates on our historical experience on our forecasts and on other available information as appropriate our significant accounting policies are described in note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 26 2009 included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

our critical accounting estimates which require the most significant management estimates and judgment in determining amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k are as follows 

 

solar module collection and recycling at the time of sale we recognize an expense for the estimated fair value of our future obligation for collecting and recycling the solar modules that we have sold when they have reached the end of their useful lives we base our estimate of the fair value of our collection and recycling obligations on the present value of the expected future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules which includes the cost of packaging the solar modules for transport the cost of freight from the solar modules’ installation sites to a recycling center the material labor and capital costs of the recycling process and an estimated thirdparty profit margin and return on risk for collection and recycling services we base this estimate on our experience collecting and recycling our solar modules and on our expectations about future developments in recycling technologies and processes about economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled and about the timing of solar modules returns for recycling in the periods between the time of our sales and our settlement of the collection and recycling obligations we accrete the carrying amount of the associated liability by applying the discount rate used for its initial measurement at december 26 2009 our estimate of the fair value of our liability for collecting and recycling solar modules was 928 million a 10 decrease in our estimate of the future cost of collecting and recycling a solar module would reduce this estimated liability by 90 million to 838 million a 10 increase in our estimate of the future cost of collecting and recycling a solar module would increase this estimated liability by 91 million to 1019 million 

product warranties we provide a limited warranty for defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for five years following delivery to the owner of our solar modules we also warrant to the owner of our solar modules that solar modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 90 of their initial power output rating during the first 10 years following their installation and at least 80 of their initial power output rating during the following 15 years our warranties are automatically transferred from the original purchaser of our solar modules to a subsequent purchaser we accrue warranty costs when we recognize sales using amounts estimated based on our historical experience with warranty claims our monitoring of field installation sites and inhouse testing 

accounting for income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the united states its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining our provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit we regularly assess the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and subsequent years’ examinations and we record tax liabilities as appropriate 

we establish liabilities for potential additional taxes that may arise out of tax audits in accordance with asc 740 income taxes  once established we adjust the liabilities when additional information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring an adjustment significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the actual cost of a legal claim tax assessment or regulatory fine or penalty may ultimately be materially different from our recorded liabilities if any 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements we calculate our income tax expense based on our interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business this requires us to estimate our current tax obligations and the realizability of uncertain tax positions and to assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities the net current amount of which we show as a component of current assets or current liabilities and the net noncurrent amount of which we show as other assets or other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 

we must also assess the likelihood that each of our deferred tax assets will be realized to the extent we believe that realization of any of our deferred tax assets is not more likely than not we establish a valuation allowance when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a reporting period we generally record a corresponding tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations conversely to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed which generally reduces our overall income tax expense 

page 42 

  

we also consider the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and determine whether such amounts are indefinitely reinvested outside the united states we have concluded that all such accumulated earnings are currently indefinitely reinvested accordingly no additional taxes have been accrued that might be incurred if such amounts were repatriated to the united states if our intention to permanently reinvest the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries changes additional taxes may be required to be accrued see note 18 “income taxes” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired companies over the estimated fair value assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed we do not amortize goodwill but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter and if necessary we would record any impairment in accordance with asc 350 intangibles  goodwill and other we will perform an impairment review between scheduled annual tests if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill is less than its carrying value in the process of our annual impairment review we primarily use the income approach of valuation which includes the discounted cash flow method and the market approach of valuation which considers values of comparable businesses to determine the fair value of our goodwill significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results and the discount rates that we used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation and in the selection of comparable businesses that we used in the market approach 

 

we reported 2865 million of goodwill at december 26 2009 which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net tangible and intangible assets that we acquired from turner renewable energy llc and optisolar inc in accordance with asc 350 intangibles – goodwill and other we performed our annual test of our goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of the year ended december 26 2009 and concluded that it was not impaired testing goodwill for impairment involves two steps the first step is comparing the fair value of a reporting unit containing goodwill to its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value impairment is indicated and step two of the test must be performed that step involves determining the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to the fair values of its identifiable assets and liabilities any excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the net fair values of its identifiable assets and liabilities is attributed to goodwill and any amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds this implied fair value is written off as an impairment loss the fair value of our goodwill substantially exceeded the carrying value and therefore we concluded that there was no indication that our goodwill was impaired and that performing step two of the goodwill impairment test was not applicable 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december 26 2009 december 27 2008 and december 29 2007 

 

page 43 

  

fiscal years ended december 26 2009 and december 27 2008 

 

net sales 

 

the increase in our net sales was primarily driven by price elasticity that resulted in strong demand for our solar modules as prices declined resulting in a 114 increase in the mw volume of solar modules sold during 2009 compared with 2008 and from an increase in business activity associated with our systems segment business partially offset by a decrease in our module average selling price revenue recognized for our systems business during 2009 was 1150 million and resulted primarily from the sale of two utility scale solar power systems to utilities in the united states and canada the increase in mw volume of solar modules sold is attributable to the full production ramp of all four plants at our malaysian manufacturing center continued improvements to our manufacturing process and the growth in our systems business in addition we increased the average conversion efficiency by approximately 3 during 2009 compared with 2008 our average selling price decreased by approximately 25 during 2009 compared with 2008 approximately 20 of the decline in our average selling price was primarily due to competitive pressure including the commencement of a customer rebate program in the third quarter of 2009 additionally our average selling price was adversely impacted by approximately 4 due to a decrease in the foreign exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro and by approximately 1 due to a shift in customer mix during 2009 and 2008 65 and 74 respectively of our net sales resulted from sales of solar modules to customers headquartered in germany 

cost of sales 

 

the increase in our cost of sales was due to higher production and sales volumes which resulted from the commencement of production at all of our four plants at our malaysian manufacturing center production ramp of our perrysburg ohio expansion and an increase in business activity associated with our systems segment business the increased production and sales volumes in our components business and increased volume sold through our systems business had the following effects a 2787 million increase in direct material expense including an 82 million amortization of project assets acquired through our optisolar acquisition a 410 million increase in warranty expense and accruals for the estimated future costs associated with the collection and recycling of our solar modules due to increased sales a 138 million increase in sales freight and other costs and a 1202 million increase in manufacturing overhead costs the increase in manufacturing overhead costs was due to a 353 million increase in salaries and personnel related expenses including a 49 million increase in sharebased compensation expense a 329 million increase in facility and related expenses and a 520 million increase in depreciation expense each of these manufacturing overhead cost increases primarily resulted from increased infrastructure associated with the build out of our malaysian manufacturing center and startup of our systems business our average manufacturing cost per watt declined by 021 per watt or 19 from 108 in 2008 to 087 in 2009 and included 001 of ramp penalty associated with the ramp and qualification of our malaysian and perrysburg manufacturing facilities and 001 of noncash stock based compensation 

gross profit 

 

 

gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased by 38 percentage points in 2009 compared with 2008 due to a decline in our average selling prices by approximately 21 partially offset by continued manufacturing cost per watt reduction of 194 the decline in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro adversely impacted our gross profit by 22 we expect that gross profit will be impacted in future periods by the volatility of the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro and product mix between our components and systems businesses 

page 44 

  

research and development 

 

the increase in our research and development expense was due to a 142 million increase in personnel related expense including a 23 million increase in sharebased compensation expense resulting from increased headcount in addition testing and qualification material costs increased by 180 million consulting and other expenses increased by 115 million and grants received decreased by 09 million during 2009 compared with 2008 during fiscal 2009 we continued the development of solar modules with increased efficiencies at converting sunlight into electricity and we increased the conversion efficiency of our modules by approximately 3 in comparison to fiscal 2008 

selling general and administrative 

 

the increase in selling general and administrative expense was due to a 660 million increase in salaries and personnelrelated expenses including a 230 million increase in sharebased compensation expense of which 157 million were onetime charges associated with our executive management team in addition legal and professional service fees increased by 133 million and other expenses increased by 196 million and included 69 million of onetime charges of which 55 million of costs related to the acquisition integration and operation of the solar power project development business of optisolar which we acquired on april 3 2009 

production startup 

 

during 2009 we incurred 139 million of production startup expenses for our malaysian and perrysburg manufacturing expansions including legal regulatory and personnel costs compared with 325 million of production startup expenses for our malaysian manufacturing expansion during 2008 production startup expenses are comprised of the cost of labor and material and depreciation expense to run and qualify the production lines related facility expenses management of our replication process and legal and regulatory costs 

page 45 

  

foreign currency gain 

 

foreign currency gain decreased primarily due to a decrease in our net foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 

interest income 

 

interest income decreased primarily due to a substantial decline in interest rates 

interest expense net 

 

interest expense net of amounts capitalized increased primarily due to lower amounts of interest expense capitalized during 2009 in addition interest expense net for 2009 includes a 24 million expense related to the termination of the interest rate swaps for our german debt facility we fully repaid this facility on june 30 2009 

other expense net 

 

other expense net increased primarily due to expenses associated with our credit default swaps which expired in the second quarter of 2009 

page 46 

  

income tax expense 

 

income tax expense decreased primarily due to the effect of our tax holiday in malaysia during 2009 a significant amount of our pretax income was generated in malaysia where we have a 165 year tax holiday in addition we recognized an 115 million tax benefit during 2009 related to the reversal of 2008 malaysian tax due to the pullforward of the tax holiday to 2008 which was granted in 2009 see also note 18 “income taxes” to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information 

fiscal years ended december 27 2008 and december 29 2007 

net sales 

 

the increase in our net sales was due primarily to a 148 increase in the mw volume of solar modules sold during 2008 compared with 2007 due to strong demand for our solar modules in europe the increase in mw volume of solar modules sold was attributable to the full production ramp of our german plant commencement of product shipments at the first two plants at our malaysian manufacturing center and continued improvements to our manufacturing process in addition we increased the average number of sellable watts per solar module by approximately 4 during 2008 compared with 2007 our average selling price decreased by approximately 1 during 2008 compared with 2007 mainly due to a 65 contractual price decline partially offset by a 6 increase related to a favorable foreign exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro approximately 74 of our net sales during 2008 resulted from sales of solar modules to customers headquartered in germany 

cost of sales 

 

the increase in our cost of sales was due to higher production and sales volumes which resulted from the full production ramp of our german facility and commencement of production at our first three plants at our malaysian manufacturing center these factors caused a 1911 million increase in direct material expense a 138 million increase in warranty and accruals for the estimated future costs associated with the collection and recycling of our solar modules a 94 million increase in sales freight and other costs and a 1010 million increase in manufacturing overhead costs the increase in manufacturing overhead costs was due to a 405 million increase in salaries and personnel related expenses including a 24 million increase in sharebased compensation expense a 307 million increase in facility and related expenses and a 298 million increase in depreciation expense in each case primarily resulting from increased infrastructure associated with our german and malaysian expansions 

 

gross profit 

 

as a percentage of sales gross profit increased 45 percentage points from 2007 to 2008 representing increased leverage of our fixed cost infrastructure and scalability associated with our german and malaysian expansions which drove a 148 increase in the number of megawatts sold our average manufacturing cost per watt decreased by 9 during 2008 while our average selling prices decreased by 1 during 2008 foreign currency gains due to a favorable exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro and increased leverage of our fixed cost infrastructure contributed approximately 19 and 56 respectively to our gross profit partially offset by a 30 decline in our average selling prices 

page 47 

  

research and development 

 

the increase in our research and development expense was due to a 137 million increase in personnel related expense including a 12 million increase in sharebased compensation expense due to increased headcount and additional sharebased compensation awards in addition consulting and other expenses increased by 38 million and grant revenue increased by 09 million during 2008 compared with 2007 

selling general and administrative 

 

the increase in selling general and administrative expense was due to a 620 million increase in salaries and personnelrelated expenses including a 155 million increase in sharebased compensation in addition legal and professional service fees increased by 130 million and other expenses increased by 168 million during 2008 the increase resulted primarily from the expansion of our solar power system and project development business as well as operating a global manufacturing business 

page 48 

  

production startup 

 

during 2008 we incurred 325 million of production startup expenses for our ohio and malaysian manufacturing expansion including legal regulatory and personnel costs compared with 169 million of production startup expenses for our german and malaysian plant expansions during 2007 production startup expenses are primarily the cost of labor and material and depreciation expense to run and qualify the production lines related facility expenses management of our replication process and legal and regulatory costs 

foreign currency gain 

 

foreign exchange gain increased by 38 million during 2008 due to a substantial increase in our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and the high volatility of the us dollar relative to other currencies in particular the euro 

interest income 

 

interest income remained relatively flat primarily as a result of higher cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances during 2008 offset by a decline in interest rates 

interest expense net 

 

interest expense net of amounts capitalized decreased primarily as a result of higher amounts of interest expense capitalized due to the construction of our malaysian manufacturing center 

page 49 

  

other expense net 

 

other expense net consisted mainly of financing fees related to our credit facilities during 2008 other expense was reduced by a marktomarket gain of 06 million associated with our credit default swap 

income tax expense benefit 

 

income tax expense increased by 1178 million primarily due to the increase in pretax income of 3078 million as well as the reversal of a valuation allowance in 2007 of 549 million 

our malaysian subsidiary has been granted a tax holiday for a period of 165 years which was originally scheduled to commence on january 1 2009 which generally provides for a 100 exemption from malaysian income tax subsequent to year end we received formal approval granting our request to pull forward this previously approved tax holiday by one year due to the fact that this approval was granted subsequent to the end of 2008 we concluded that the financial impact should be reflected in our 2009 financial results 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 26 2009 we had 11143 million in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities compared with 8218 million as of december 27 2008 we believe that our current cash cash equivalents marketable securities cash flows from operating activities and our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months however if our financial results or operating plans change from our current assumptions we may not have sufficient resources to support our business plan 

our expanding systems business is expected to have increasing liquidity requirements in the future solar power project development cycles which span the time between the identification of land and the commercial operation of a photovoltaic power plant project vary substantially and can take many months or years to mature as a result of these long project cycles we may need to make significant up front investments of resources in advance of the signing of power purchase agreements and epc contracts and the receipt of any revenue we have historically financed these up front investments primarily using working capital and cash on hand in the future we may also engage in one or more debt or equity financings such financings could result in increased expenses or dilution to our existing stockholders if we are unable to obtain debt or equity financing on reasonable terms we may be unable to execute our expansion strategy 

the unprecedented disruption in the credit markets over the past two years has had a significant adverse impact on a number of financial institutions as of december 26 2009 our liquidity and investments have not been materially adversely impacted by the current credit environment and we believe that they will not be materially adversely impacted in the near future we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity and the credit markets however we cannot predict with any certainty the impact to us of any further disruption in the credit environment

cash flows 

the following table summarizes the key cash flow metrics for the years ended december 26 2009 december 27 2008 and december 29 2007 in thousands 

 

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 6752 million during 2009 compared with 4631 million during 2008 net cash provided by operating activities during 2009 resulted primarily from an increase in net income and the impact of noncash items that were recorded on our statements of operations primarily depreciation and amortization expense and stockbased compensation expense offset by an increase in operating assets primarily accounts receivable and deferred project costs 

cash received from customers increased to 19576 million during 2009 compared with 12038 million during 2008 primarily due to an increase in net sales offset by an increase in accounts receivable of 1222 million the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the amendment of certain of our customers’ longterm supply contracts to extend their payment terms from net 10 days to net 45 days primarily to increase liquidity in our sales channel and to reflect longer module shipment times from our manufacturing plants in malaysia and due to additional volume shipped during 2009 our net sales increased from 12463 million during 2008 to 20662 million during 2009 

cash paid to suppliers and associates increased to 11237 million during 2009 from 7231 million during 2008 mainly due to an increase in raw material and component purchases an increase in personnelrelated costs due to higher headcount and other costs supporting our growth inventory increased by 521 million of which 322 million related to an increase in finished goods inventory as a result of inventory requirements for utility scale projects in north america 

income taxes paid net of refunds during 2009 were 1478 million compared to 20 million during 2008 

cash provided by operating activities was 4631 million during 2008 compared with 2060 million during 2007 net cash provided by operating activities during 2008 resulted primarily from an increase in net income accounts payable and accrued expenses in this period as well as the impact of noncash items that were recorded on our statements of operations primarily depreciation and amortization expense and stockbased compensation expense offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories to support growth our inventories increased by 848 million during 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to an increase in raw materials and work in process as a result of revenue growth 

cash received from customers increased to 12038 million during 2008 from 5160 million during 2007 primarily due to an increase in net sales our net sales increased from 5040 million during 2007 to 12463 million in 2008 this increase was partially offset by cash paid to suppliers and associates of 7231 million during 2008 compared with cash paid to suppliers and associates of 2765 million during 2007 mainly due to an increase in raw material and component purchases an increase in personnelrelated costs due to higher headcount and other costs supporting our global expansion 

page 51 

  

investing activities 

cash used in investing activities was 7017 million during 2009 compared with 3084 million during 2008 cash used in investing activities during 2009 resulted primarily from the net purchase of marketable securities of 3425 million the net investment in notes receivable of 742 million to fund construction of various photovoltaic power generation facilities capital expenditures of 2799 million and an increase of 42 million in restricted investments to fund our solar module collection and recycling program capital expenditures during 2009 related primarily to the expansion of our plant in perrysburg ohio and completion of construction of our new plants in malaysia see note 11 “notes receivable” to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the abovereferenced notes receivable 

on april 3 2009 we completed the acquisition of the solar power project development business of optisolar inc the total consideration consisted of 2972420 shares of our common stock of which 355096 shares represented a contingent consideration the total purchase price based on the closing price of our common stock on april 3 2009 of 13438 per share was 3994 million see also note 3 “acquisitions” to our consolidated financial statements 

we expect to spend up to 5500 million in capital expenditures for 2010 including expenditures related to the eightline expansion of our manufacturing facility in malaysia a majority of our capital expenditures for 2010 will be incurred in foreign currency and therefore are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

at the beginning of each fiscal year we prefund our estimated solar module collection and recycling costs for solar modules that we sold during the prior fiscal year through a custodial account with a large bank as investment advisor in the name of a trust for which first solar inc first solar malaysia sdn bhd and first solar manufacturing gmbh are grantors for this purpose we assume a minimum service life of 25 years for our solar modules prior to june 2009 we prefunded our estimated solar module collection and recycling costs through a financial services company at december 26 2009 we had 365 million in the new custodial account which we classified in our restricted investments on our balance sheet see note 6 “restricted cash and investments” to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

cash used in investing activities was 3084 million during 2008 compared with 5473 million during 2007 cash used in investing activities during 2008 was primarily due to capital expenditures of 4593 million related to the construction of our plants in malaysia and germany an investment of 250 million in the preferred stock of a united states company that supplies solar power systems to commercial and residential customers and an increase in our restricted investments of 156 million to fund our solar module collection and recycling program offset by the net sale of marketable securities of 1914 million 

on november 30 2007 we completed the acquisition of turner renewable energy llc a privately held company which designed and deployed commercial solar power systems in the united states the total consideration for the transaction was 343 million excluding exit and transaction costs of 07 million consisting of 280 million in common stock and 63 million in cash see also note 3 “acquisitions” to our consolidated financial statements 

financing activities 

cash used in financing activities was 220 million during 2009 compared with cash provided by financing activities of 1775 million during 2008 cash used in financing activities during 2009 resulted primarily from the repayment of longterm debt of 782 million which was partially offset by i proceeds of 447 million from the issuance of debt net of issuance cost related to the equipment export financing agreement for our malaysian manufacturing center ii proceeds from the issuance of common stock of 60 million during 2009 mainly due to the exercise of employee stock options and iii excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation arrangements of 49 million 

cash provided by financing activities was 1775 million during 2008 compared with 4304 million during 2007 cash provided by financing activities during 2008 resulted primarily from an increase in investment incentives   related to the construction of our plant in frankfurtoder germany of 357 million and proceeds from the issuance of debt net of issuance cost of 1389 million related to the equipment export facility agreement for our malaysian manufacturing center see note 13 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements for more information about these credit facilities this increase was partially offset by the repayment of longterm debt of 417 million in 2008 excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation arrangements during 2008 were 287 million 

proceeds from the issuance of common stock during 2007 were 3761 million mainly due to the receipt of 3660 million in net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock as a result of our followon offering and 102 million of proceeds received from the exercise of employee stock options

contractual obligations 

the following table presents our contractual obligations as of december 26 2009 which consists of legal commitments requiring us to make fixed or determinable cash payments regardless of contractual requirements with the vendor to provide future goods or services we purchase raw materials for inventory services and manufacturing equipment from a variety of vendors during the normal course of business in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help assure adequate supply we enter into agreements with suppliers that either allow us to procure goods and services when we choose or that establish purchase requirements 

 

 

in addition to the amounts shown in the table above we have recorded 372 million of unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities in accordance with asc 740 and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 

debt and credit sources 

revolving credit facility 

on september 4 2009 we entered into a revolving credit facility pursuant to a credit agreement among first solar inc certain designated borrowing subsidiaries consisting of first solar manufacturing gmbh a german subsidiary and other subsidiaries of our company who may in the future be designated as borrowers pursuant to the credit agreement and several lenders jpmorgan chase bank na and bank of america served as jointlead arrangers and bookrunners with jpmorgan also acting as administrative agent the credit agreement provides us and the borrowing subsidiaries with a senior secured threeyear revolving credit facility in an aggregate available amount of 3000 million a portion of which is available for letters of credit and swingline loans subject to certain conditions we have the right to request an increase in the aggregate commitments under the facility up to 4000 million in connection with the credit agreement we also entered into a guarantee and collateral agreement and foreign security agreements 

at december 26 2009 we had no borrowings outstanding and 460 million in letters of credit drawn on the revolving credit facility leaving approximately 2540 million in capacity available under the revolving credit facility 290 million of which may be used for letters of credit as of this date based on applicable indices the allin effective three months libor borrowing rate under the facility was 347 see also note 13 “debt” to our consolidated financial statements

we had no offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 26 2009 

recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 2 “summary of significant accounting policies” to our consolidated financial statements filed with this annual report on form 10k for a summary of recent accounting pronouncements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

foreign currency exchange risk 

our international operations accounted for 93 of our net sales during 2009 and 95 of our net sales during 2008 of which 92 and 100 of these international sales respectively were denominated in euros as a result we have exposure to foreign exchange risk with respect to almost all of our net sales fluctuations in exchange rates particularly in the us dollar to euro exchange rate affect our gross and net profit margins and could result in foreign exchange and operating losses in the past most of our exposure to foreign exchange risk has related to currency gains and losses between the times we sign and settle our sales contracts for example our longterm supply contracts obligate us to deliver solar modules at a fixed price in euros per watt and do not adjust for fluctuations in the us dollar to euro exchange rate for the year ended december 26 2009 a 10 change in the euro exchange rates would have impacted our net euro sales by 1777 million for our manufacturing operations in germany and malaysia many of our operating expenses for the plants in these countries are denominated in the local currency 

our primary foreign currency exposures are transaction exposure cash flow exposure and earnings translation exposure 

transaction exposure many components of our business have assets and liabilities primarily receivables investments accounts payable debt solar module collection and recycling liabilities and intercompany transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the relevant entity’s functional currency changes in the exchange rates between our components’ functional currencies and the currencies in which these assets and liabilities are denominated can create fluctuations in our reported consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other financial instruments to hedge assets and liabilities against the shortterm effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations the gains and losses on the foreign exchange forward contracts will offset all or part of the transaction gains and losses that we recognize in earnings on the related foreign currency assets and liabilities as of december 26 2009 the total unrealized loss on our foreign exchange forward contracts was 68 million these contracts have maturities of less than two months 

since our acquisition of the solar power project development business of optisolar on april 3 2009 we have also become exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and canadian dollar 

page 54 

  

as of december 26 2009 the total notional value of our foreign exchange forward contracts was as follows notional amounts and us dollar equivalents in millions 

 

if the us dollar would have weakened by 10 against the euro malaysian ringgit canadian dollar and japanese yen the favorable impact on our income before income taxes related to our foreign exchange contracts to purchase and sell euro malaysian ringgit canadian dollars and japanese yen would have been 05 million 

cash flow exposure we expect many of the components of our business to have material future cash flows including revenues and expenses which will be denominated in currencies other than the components’ functional currency our primary cash flow exposures are future customer collections and vendor payments changes in the exchange rates between our components’ functional currency and the other currencies in which they transact business will cause fluctuations in the cash flows we expect to receive when these cash flows are realized or settled accordingly we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the value of a portion of these forecasted cash flows we account for these foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges we initially report the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently reclassify amounts into earnings when the hedged transaction is realized 

most of our german plant’s operating expenses are denominated in euros creating natural hedges against the currency risk in our net sales in addition we purchased foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the exchange risk on forecasted cash flows denominated in euro as of december 26 2009 the unrealized loss on these contracts was 159 million and the total notional value of the contracts was €3610 million 5198 million at the balance sheet close rate on december 26 2009 of 144€100 the weighted average forward exchange rate for these contracts was 140€100 at december 26 2009 

earnings translation exposure fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to consolidate financial statements of our foreign currency denominated subsidiaries we may decide to purchase forward exchange contracts or other instruments to offset this impact from currency fluctuations these contracts would be markedtomarket on a monthly basis and any unrealized gain or loss would be recorded in interest and other income net we do not hedge translation exposure at this time but may do so in the future 

in the past currency exchange rate fluctuations have had an impact on our business and results of operations for example currency exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted our cash flows by 32 million and 202 million in the years ended december 26 2009 and december 27 2008 respectively although we cannot predict the impact of future currency exchange rate fluctuations on our business or results of operations we believe that we will continue to have risk associated with currency exchange rate fluctuations in the future 

page 55 

  

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to interest rate risk because many of our customers depend on debt and equity financing to purchase and install a solar power system although the useful life of a solar electricity generation system is considered to be approximately 25 years endusers of our solar modules must pay the entire cost of the system at the time of installation as a result many of our customers rely on debt financing to fund their upfront capital expenditures an increase in interest rates could make it difficult for our endusers to secure the financing necessary to purchase and install a system this could lower demand for our solar modules and system development services and reduce our net sales in addition we believe that a significant percentage of our endusers install solar power systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt an increase in interest rates could lower an investor’s return on investment in a system or make alternative investments more attractive relative to solar power systems which in each case could cause these endusers to seek alternative investments that promise higher returns 

during 2006 we entered into a credit facility with a consortium of banks for the financing of our german plant which bore interest at the euro interbank offered rate euribor plus 16 we had interest rate swap contracts with a financial institution that effectively converted to fixed rates the variable rate of euribor on the term loan portion of this credit facility these swap contracts were required under the credit facility agreement which we repaid and terminated on june 30 2009 therefore we terminated these interest rate swap contracts on june 26 2009 and consequently recognized interest expense of €17 million 24 million at the balance sheet close rate on december 26 2009 of 144€100 the termination of the interest rate swap contracts settled on june 30 2009 

during may 2008 we entered into a eurodenominated credit facility to finance some of the equipment cost for our malaysian manufacturing center the loans under the fixedrate portion of the credit facility bear interest on the outstanding unpaid principal balance at an annual rate of 454 the loans under the floatingrate portion of the credit facility bear interest on the outstanding unpaid principal balance at euribor plus a margin of 055 on may 29 2009 we entered into an interest rate swap contract with a notional value of €573 million 825 million at the balance sheet close rate on december 26 2009 of 144€100 to receive a sixmonth floating interest rate equal to euribor and pay a fixed rate of 280 this contract became effective on september 30 2009 the notional amount of the interest rate swap contract is scheduled to decline in correspondence to our scheduled principal payments on the underlying hedged debt 

in addition we invest in debt securities which exposes us to interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and provide liquidity on demand while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the market value of the investment to fluctuate for example if we hold a security that was issued with an interest rate fixed at the thenprevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises the market value of our investment will probably decline to minimize this risk we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities including money market mutual funds government and nongovernment debt securities and certificates of deposit as of december 26 2009 our fixedincome investments earned a pretax yield of 108 with a weighted average maturity of 72 months if interest rates were to instantaneously increase decrease by 100 basis points the market value of our total investment portfolio could decrease increase by 48 million the direct risk to us associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and we do not believe that a 10 change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows as of december 26 2009 all of our investments were in money market mutual funds federal and foreign agency debt supranational debt corporate debt securities foreign government obligations and asset backed securities 

commodity and component risk 

we are exposed to price risks for the raw materials components and energy costs used in the manufacture and transportation of our solar modules also some of our raw materials and components are sourced from a limited number of suppliers or a sole supplier we endeavor to qualify multiple suppliers a process which could take up to 12 months if successful but some suppliers are unique and it may not be feasible to qualify second source suppliers in some cases we also enter into longterm supply contracts for raw materials and components but these arrangements are normally of shorter duration than the term of our longterm supply contracts with our customers as a result we remain exposed to price changes in the raw materials and components used in our solar modules in addition a failure by a key supplier could disrupt our supply chain which could result in higher prices for our raw materials and components and even a disruption in our manufacturing process since our selling price under our longterm supply contracts does not adjust in the event of price changes in our underlying raw materials or components and since our longterm supply contracts require minimum deliveries of our products during their terms we are unable to pass along changes in the cost of the raw materials and components for our products and may be in default of our delivery obligations if we experience a manufacturing disruption 

page 56 

  

credit risk 

we have certain financial and derivative instruments that subject us to credit risk these consist primarily of cash cash equivalents investments trade accounts receivable interest rate swap contracts and foreign exchange forward contracts we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our financial and derivative instruments we place cash cash equivalents investments interest rate swap contracts and foreign exchange forward contracts with various highquality financial institutions and limit the amount of credit risk from any one counterparty we continuously evaluate the credit standing of our counterparty financial institutions

 item 9a controls and procedures 

a evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

we maintain “disclosure controls and procedures” as such term is defined in rule 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met additionally in designing disclosure controls and procedures our management was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures the design of any disclosure control and procedure also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 

based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level 

b management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate “internal control over financial reporting” as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 26 2009 based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 

based on the results of our evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 26 2009 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 26 2009 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears herein 

c changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter ended december 26 2009 covered by this annual report on form 10k that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

page 58 

  

d inherent limitations on effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within our company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

 item 1   business tableend  

we design and manufacture solar modules using a proprietary thin film semiconductor technology that has allowed us to reduce our average solar module manufacturing costs to among the lowest in the world in 2008 our average manufacturing costs were 108 per watt which we believe is significantly less than those of traditional crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers by continuing to expand production and improve our technology and manufacturing process we believe that we can further reduce our manufacturing costs per watt and maintain our cost advantage over traditional crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers 

 

we manufacture our solar modules on highthroughput production lines and perform all manufacturing steps ourselves in an automated proprietary continuous process our solar modules employ a thin layer of cadmium telluride semiconductor material to convert sunlight into electricity in less than three hours we transform a 2ft × 4ft 60cm × 120cm sheet of glass into a complete solar module using approximately 1 of the semiconductor material used by other manufacturers to produce crystalline silicon solar modules our manufacturing process eliminates the multiple supply chain operators and expensive and time consuming batch processing steps that are used to produce a crystalline silicon solar module 

 

we have longterm solar module supply contracts the “long term supply contracts” with one us and fifteen european project developers system integrators and operators that in the aggregate allow for approximately 58 billion 49 billion denominated in euro at an assumed exchange rate of 115€100 and 02 billion denominated in usd in sales from 2009 to 2013 during 2008 we amended a long term supply contract with one customer which reduced the volume of solar modules delivered to such customer in 2008 and also reduced the volume of solar modules to be delivered over the remaining term of the agreement to such customer during february 2009 we amended our long term supply contracts with two customers to accelerate the decline in the sales price per watt under such contracts in 2009 and 2010 in exchange for increases in the volume of solar modules to be delivered under such contracts we are currently in discussions with several other customers about making similar amendments to their long term supply contracts 

our customers typically develop own and operate solar power plants or sell turnkey solar power plants to endusers that include owners of land owners of agricultural buildings owners of commercial warehouses offices and industrial buildings public agencies municipal government authorities utility companies and financial investors that desire to own large scale solar power plant projects 

 

in order to satisfy our contractual requirements we expanded our manufacturing capacity with the construction of four plants — each with four production lines — at our malaysian manufacturing center in august 2006 we expanded our ohio plant from one to three production lines in april 2007 we started initial production at a four line manufacturing plant in germany which reached its full capacity in the third quarter of 2007 also in april 2007 we began construction of plant one of our malaysian manufacturing center in the third and fourth quarters of 2007 we began construction of plants two and three respectively and in the first quarter of 2008 we began construction of plant four we completed the qualification of plants one and two of our malaysian manufacturing center for full volume production in the second half of 2008 we expect plants three and four of our malaysian manufacturing center to reach full capacity in the first half of 2009 further in october 2008 we commenced construction of our ohio plant expansion which is expected to include an additional production line and approximately 500000 square feet of manufacturing research and development and office space we expect to complete plant construction in the first half of 2009 with full volume production expected by the second quarter of 2010 after plant four of our malaysian manufacturing center and the ohio expansion reach full capacity we expect to have 24 production lines and an annual global manufacturing capacity of approximately 1145mw by the end of 2010 based on the fourth quarter of 2008 average per line run rate at our existing plants 

 

acquisition of turner renewable energy llc 

 

on november 30 2007 we completed the acquisition of turner renewable energy llc a privately held company which designed and deployed commercial solar power system projects for utilities and fortune 500 companies in the united states we have integrated the operations from this acquisition into our solar power systems and project development business this business sells solar power systems directly to system owners these systems include both our solar modules and balance of system components that we procure from third parties we also sell integrated services related to the development of commercial solar projects in the united states such as system design engineering procurement of permits and balance of system components construction management monitoring and maintenance as part of a system solution delivery this acquisition has created a platform for our systems business in north america to deliver solar electricity solutions to utility companies 

 

products 

 

solar modules 

 

each solar module is approximately 2ft × 4ft 60cm × 120cm and had an average rated power of approximately 73 watts 70 watts and 64 watts for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively our solar module is a singlejunction polycrystalline thin film structure that uses cadmium telluride as the absorption layer and cadmium sulfide as the window layer cadmium telluride has absorption properties that are highly matched to the solar spectrum and has the potential to deliver competitive conversion efficiencies with approximately 1 of the semiconductor material used by traditional crystalline silicon solar modules our thin film technology also has relatively high energy performance in low light and high temperature environments compared with traditional crystalline silicon solar modules 

 

certifications 

 

we have participated or are currently participating in laboratory and field tests with the national renewable energy laboratory the arizona state university photovoltaic testing laboratory the fraunhofer institute for solar energy tÜv immissionsschutz und energiesysteme gmbh and the institute für solar energieversorgungstechnik currently we have approximately 10000 solar modules installed worldwide at test sites designed to collect data for field performance validation using data logging equipment we also monitor more than one million solar modules representing approximately 69mw of installed photovoltaic systems in use by endusers that have purchased 

systems using our solar modules the modules in these monitored systems represent approximately 11 of all the solar modules we shipped from 2002 through 2008 

 

we maintain all certifications required to sell solar modules in the markets we serve or expect to serve including ul 1703 iec 61646 safety class ii and ce 

 

solar module warranty 

 

we provide a limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for five years following delivery to the owners of our solar modules we also warrant to the owner of our solar modules that solar modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 90 of their power output rating during the first 10 years following their installation and at least 80 of their power output rating during the following 15 years in resolving claims under both the defects and power output warranties we have the option of either repairing or replacing the covered solar module or under the power output warranty providing additional solar modules to remedy the power shortfall our warranties are automatically transferred from the original purchaser of our solar modules to a subsequent purchaser as of december 27 2008 our accrued warranty liability was 119 million of which 40 million was classified as current and 79 million was classified as noncurrent 

 

collection and recycling program 

 

endusers can return their solar modules to us at any time for collection and recycling at no cost we prefund the estimated collection and recycling cost at the time of sale assuming for this purpose a minimum service life of approximately 20 years for our solar modules in addition to achieving substantial environmental benefits our solar module collection and recycling program may provide us the opportunity to resell or redistribute working modules or recover certain raw materials and components for reuse in our manufacturing process we have developed a recycling process for manufacturing scrap warranty returns and end of life modules that produces glass suitable for use in the production of new glass products and extracts metals that will be further processed by a third party supplier to produce semiconductor materials for reuse in our solar modules 

 

services 

 

our solar power systems and project development business provides a variety of integrated services to our customers as part of a system solution delivery these services include solar power system design procurement of permits and balance of system components construction management monitoring and maintenance 

 

manufacturing 

 

manufacturing process 

 

we have integrated our manufacturing processes into a continuous integrated production line with the following three stages the “deposition” stage the “cell definition” stage and the “assembly and test” stage in the deposition stage panels of treated glass are robotically loaded onto the production line where they are cleaned heated and coated with a layer of cadmium sulfide followed by a layer of cadmium telluride using our proprietary vapor transport deposition technology after which the semiconductorcoated plates are cooled rapidly to increase strength in our cell definition stage we use high speed lasers to transform the large single semiconductorcoated plate into a series of interconnected cells that deliver the desired current and voltage output our proprietary laser scribing technology is capable of accomplishing accurate and complex scribes at high speeds finally in the assembly and test stage we apply busbars laminate a rear glass cover sheet and termination wires seal the joint box and subject each solar module to a solar simulator and current leakage test the final assembly stage is the only stage in our production line that requires manual processing 

 

historically all of our solar modules were produced at our perrysburg ohio facility which has received both an iso 90012000 quality system certification and iso 140012004 environmental system certification in april 2007 we started initial production at our manufacturing facility in frankfurtoder germany which has received all applicable licenses and permits to operate in accordance with german law and has received both an iso 90012000 

quality system certification and iso 140012004 environmental system certification in april 2008 we started initial production at plant one of our manufacturing center in kulim malaysia which has received an iso 90012000 quality system certification and we anticipate the malaysian manufacturing center will obtain an iso 140012004 environmental system certification in the second quarter of 2009 

 

raw materials 

 

our manufacturing process uses approximately 20 types of raw materials and components to construct a complete solar module of these raw materials and components the following nine are critical to our manufacturing process tco coated front glass cadmium sulfide cadmium telluride photo resist laminate tempered back glass cord platecord plate cap lead wire ul and tÜv and solar connectors before we use these materials and components in our manufacturing process a supplier must undergo a qualification process that can last up to 12 months depending on the type of raw material or component although we continually evaluate new suppliers and currently are qualifying several new suppliers a few of our critical materials or components are sole sourced and most others are supplied by a limited number of suppliers one critical raw material in our production process is cadmium telluride 

 

customers 

 

we have long term supply contracts with sixteen principal customers for the sale of solar modules these customers include solar power system project developers system integrators and operators of renewable energy projects that are headquartered throughout the european union and the united states the long term supply contracts in the aggregate allow for approximately 58 billion 49 billion denominated in euro at an assumed exchange rate of 115€100 and 02 billion denominated in usd in sales from 2009 to 2013 during 2008 we amended a long term supply contract with one customer which reduced the volume of solar modules delivered to such customer in 2008 and also reduced the volume of solar modules to be delivered over the remaining term of the agreement to such customer during february 2009 we amended our long term supply contracts with two customers to accelerate the decline in the sales price per watt under such contracts in 2009 and 2010 in exchange for increases in the volume of solar modules to be delivered under such contracts we are currently in discussions with several other customers about making similar amendments to their long term supply contracts 

 

during 2008 our principal customers were blitzstrom gmbh colexon energy ag previously reinecke  pohl conergy ag juwi solar gmbh and phoenix solar ag during 2008 each of these five customers individually accounted for between 11 and 19 of our net sales all of our other customers individually accounted for less than 10 of our net sales during 2008 the loss of any of our major customers could have an adverse effect on our business as we expand our manufacturing capacity we are seeking to develop additional customer relationships in other markets and regions which would reduce our customer and geographic concentration and dependence 

 

sales and marketing 

 

since 2003 our focus has been on gridconnected ground or large roof mounted solar power systems in germany and other european union countries with feedin tariff subsidies that enable solar power system owners to earn a reasonable rate of return on their capital several of our principal customers were authorized in 2007 and 2008 to sell our solar modules in the united states in november 2007 we completed the acquisition of turner renewable energy llc which has become the basis for developing solar electricity solutions for utility companies in the united states that are seeking costeffective renewable energy solutions for the purpose of meeting renewable portfolio standard requirements 

 

economic incentives 

 

government subsidies economic incentives and other support for solar electricity generation generally include feedin tariffs net metering programs renewable portfolio standards rebates tax incentives and low interest loans 

 

under a feedin tariff subsidy the government sets prices that regulated utilities are required to pay for renewable electricity generated by endusers the prices are set above market rates and may differ based on system 

size or application net metering programs enable endusers to sell excess solar electricity to their local utility in exchange for a credit against their utility bills the policies governing net metering vary by state and utility some utilities pay the enduser upfront while others credit the enduser’s bill under a renewable portfolio standard the government requires regulated utilities to supply a portion of their total electricity in the form of renewable electricity some programs further specify that a portion of the renewable energy quota must be from solar electricity while others provide no specific technology requirement for renewable electricity generation 

 

tax incentive programs exist in the united states at both the federal and state level and can take the form of investment tax credits accelerated depreciation sales and property tax exemptions at the united states federal level investment tax credits for business and residential solar systems have gone through several cycles of enactment and expiration since the 1980’s several state governments also facilitate low interest loans for photovoltaic systems either through direct lending credit enhancement or other programs 

 

regulations and policies relating to electricity pricing and interconnection also encourage distributive generation with photovoltaic systems photovoltaic systems generate most of their electricity during midday and the early afternoon hours when the demand for and cost of electricity is highest as a result electricity generated by photovoltaic systems mainly competes with expensive peak hour electricity rather than the lower average price of electricity modifications to the peak hour pricing policies of utilities such as to a flat rate would require photovoltaic systems to achieve lower prices in order to compete with the price of electricity in addition interconnection policies often enable the owner of a photovoltaic system to feed solar electricity into the power grid without interconnection costs or standby fees 

 

research development and engineering 

 

we continue to devote a substantial amount of resources to research and development with the objective of lowering the per watt price of solar electricity generated by photovoltaic systems with the objective of reducing the per watt manufacturing cost of electricity generated by photovoltaic systems using our solar modules we focus our research and development on the following areas 

 

  

research and development expenses for the years ended december 27 2008 december 29 2007 and december 30 2006 were 335 million 151 million and 64 million respectively 

 

we typically qualify process and product improvements for full production at our ohio plant and then use our “copy smart” process to propagate them to our other production lines our scientists and engineers collaborate across all manufacturing plants to drive improvements we typically implement validate and qualify improvements at the ohio plant before we deploy them to all of our production lines we believe that this systematic approach to research and development will provide continuous improvements and ensure uniform adoption across our production lines in addition our production lines are replicas of each other using our “copy smart” process and as a result a process or production improvement on one line can be rapidly deployed to other production lines 

we maintain active collaborations with the national renewable energy laboratory a division of the united states department of energy brookhaven national laboratory and several universities 

 

intellectual property 

 

our success depends in part on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technology and to conduct our business without infringing on the proprietary rights of others we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks and trade secrets as well as employee and third party confidentiality agreements to safeguard our intellectual property as of december 27 2008 we held 23 patents in the united states which will expire at various times between 2009 and 2026 and had 37 patent applications pending we also held 17 patents and had over 70 patent applications pending in foreign jurisdictions our patent applications and any future patent applications might not result in a patent being issued with the scope of the claims we seek or at all and any patents we may receive may be challenged invalidated or declared unenforceable we continually assess appropriate occasions for seeking patent protection for those aspects of our technology designs and methodologies and processes that we believe provide significant competitive advantages 

 

as of december 27 2008 we held two trademarks “first solar” and “first solar and design” in the united states we have also registered our “first solar and design” mark in china india japan korea and the european union and we are seeking registration in other countries 

 

with respect to proprietary knowhow that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce we rely on among other things trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests we believe that many elements of our photovoltaic manufacturing process involve proprietary knowhow technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications including technical processes equipment designs algorithms and procedures we have taken security measures to protect these elements all of our research and development personnel have entered into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us these agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our associates to assign to us all of the inventions designs and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us we also require our customers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our solar cells technology or business plans 

 

we have not been subject to any material intellectual property claims 

 

competition 

 

the solar energy and renewable energy industries are both highly competitive and continually evolving as participants strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete within the larger electric power industry within the renewable energy industry we compete with other renewable energy technologies including hydro wind geothermal biomass and tidal within the solar energy industry we believe that our main sources of competition are crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers other thin film solar module manufacturers and companies developing solar thermal and concentrated photovoltaic technologies among photovoltaic module and cell manufacturers the principal methods of competition are price per watt production capacity conversion efficiency and reliability 

 

at the end of 2008 the global photovoltaic industry consisted of more than 150 manufacturers of solar cells and modules within the photovoltaic industry we face competition from numerous crystalline silicon solar cell and module manufacturers we also face competition from thin film solar module manufacturers 

 

in addition we expect to compete with future entrants to the photovoltaic industry that offer new technological solutions we may also face competition from semiconductor manufacturers and semiconductor equipment manufacturers or their customers several of which have already announced their intention to start production of photovoltaic cells solar modules or turnkey production lines some of these competitors are larger and have greater financial resources larger production capacities and greater brand name recognition than we do and may as a result be better positioned to adapt to changes in the industry or the economy as a whole 

we also face competition from companies that are developing various solar thermal solutions for utility scale power plant applications in addition to manufacturers of solar photovoltaic equipment we face competition from companies developing concentrating photovoltaic systems and other renewable energy technologies 

 

our solar power products and services also compete against other power generation sources supplied by utilities that burn conventional fossil fuels 

 

as we develop our solar power systems and development business and begin to offer solar electricity solutions to utilities we expect to face competition from other providers of renewable energy solutions including developers of photovoltaic solar thermal and concentrated solar power systems and from developers of alternate forms of renewable energy projects 

 

environmental matters 

 

our manufacturing operations include the use handling storage transportation generation and disposal of hazardous materials we are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the use management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes occupational health and safety and the cleanup of contaminated sites therefore we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions and costs arising from third party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws or noncompliance with environmental permits required at our facilities we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and do not expect to incur material capital expenditures for environmental controls in the foreseeable future however future developments such as more aggressive enforcement policies the implementation of new more stringent laws and regulations or the discovery of unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations andor financial condition see “item 1a risk factors — environmental obligations and liabilities could have a substantial negative impact on our financial condition cash flows and profitability” 

 

associates 

 

as of december 27 2008 we had 3524 associates our term for full and parttime employees including 2912 in manufacturing the remainder of our associates are in research and development sales and marketing and general and administrative positions none of our associates are represented by labor unions or covered by a collective bargaining agreement as we expand domestically and internationally however we may encounter associates who desire union representation we believe that our relations with our associates are good 

 

information about geographic areas 

 

we have significant marketing distribution and manufacturing operations both within and outside the united states in 2008 94 of our net sales were generated from customers headquartered in the european union in the future we expect to expand our operations in other european and asian countries and as a result we will be subject to the legal tax political social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions the international nature of our operations subject us to a number of risks including fluctuations in exchange rates adverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements and tariffs taxes and other trade restrictions see “item 1a risk factors — our substantial international operations subject us to a number of risks including unfavorable political regulatory labor and tax conditions in foreign countries” see also note 23 “segment and geographical information” to our consolidated financial statements referenced in item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for information about our net sales by geographic region for the years ended december 27 2008 december 29 2007 and december 30 2006 and see our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k for other information about our operations and activities in various geographic regions

tablestart 


 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

an investment in our stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the following information together with the other information in this annual report on form 10k before buying shares of our stock if any of the following risks or uncertainties occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our stock could decline 

 

an increase in interest rates or lending rates or tightening of the supply of capital in the global financial markets could make it difficult for endusers to finance the cost of a pv system and could reduce the demand for our solar modules andor lead to a reduction in the average selling price for photovoltaic modules 

 

many of our endusers depend on debt financing to fund the initial capital expenditure required to purchase and install a pv system as a result an increase in interest rates or lending rates could make it difficult for our endusers to secure the financing necessary to purchase and install a pv system on favorable terms or at all and thus lower demand for our solar modules and reduce our net sales due to the overall economic outlook our endusers may change their decision or change the timing of their decision to purchase and install a pv system in addition we believe that a significant percentage of our endusers install pv systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt an increase in interest rates andor lending rates could lower an investor’s return on investment in a pv system or make alternative investments more attractive relative to pv systems and in each case could cause these endusers to seek alternative investments a reduction in the supply of project debt financing or tax equity investments could reduce the number of solar projects that receive financing and thus lower demand for solar modules 

 

we currently sell a substantial portion of our solar modules under long term supply contracts and we allocate a significant amount of our production to satisfy our obligations under these contracts these customers buy our modules with the expectation that they will be able to resell them in connection with the development of pv systems as discussed above many of these projects depend on the availability of debt and equity financing a prolonged material disruption to the supply of project finance could adversely affect our customers’ ability to perform under these agreements in the event of default by one or more of these customers we may be unable to sell these modules at the prices specified in our long term supply contracts especially if demand for pv systems softens or supplies of solar modules increase also we may decide to lower our average selling price to certain customers in certain markets in response to changes in economic circumstances of our customers their end markets or the capital markets 

 

we currently depend on a limited number of customers with five customers accounting for substantially all of our net sales last year the loss of or a significant reduction in orders from any of these customers could significantly reduce our net sales and negatively impact our operating results 

 

we currently sell substantially all of our solar modules to customers headquartered throughout the european union during 2008 our five largest customers each accounted for between 11 and 19 of our net sales the loss 

of any of our large customers their inability to perform under their contracts or their default in payment could significantly reduce our net sales and adversely impact our operating results our customers face significant challenges under current economic conditions including lack of capital to finance solar projects and rising costs associated with leasing or otherwise acquiring land and rooftops for solar projects we believe that we can mitigate this risk by reallocating modules to other customers if the need arises but we may be unable in whole or in part to mitigate the reduced demand for our modules in the event that we determine that our planned production of solar modules exceeds the demand we anticipate we may decide to reduce or halt production of solar modules in our manufacturing facilities however we may be unable to anticipate and respond to the oversupply of solar modules because we have limited visibility into our customers’ inventories 

 

our limited operating history may not serve as an adequate basis to judge our future prospects and results of operations 

 

we have a limited operating history although we began developing our predecessor technology in 1987 we did not launch commercial operations until we qualified our pilot production line in january 2002 we qualified the first production line at our ohio plant in november 2004 the second and third production lines at our ohio plant in august 2006 our german plant in the third quarter of 2007 and portions of our malaysian plants in 2008 because these production lines have only been in operation for a limited period of time our historical operating results may not provide a meaningful basis for evaluating our business financial performance and prospects while our net sales grew from 481 million in 2005 to 12463 million in 2008 we may be unable to achieve similar growth or grow at all in future periods our ability to achieve similar growth in future periods is also affected by current economic conditions our past results occurred in an environment where among other things capital was generally more accessible to our customers to finance the cost of developing solar projects accordingly you should not rely on our results of operations for any prior period as an indication of our future performance 

 

we face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules thin film solar modules and solar thermal and concentrated photovoltaic systems if global supply exceeds global demand it could lead to a reduction in the average selling price for photovoltaic modules 

 

the solar energy and renewable energy industries are both highly competitive and continually evolving as participants strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete with the larger electric power industry within the global photovoltaic industry we face competition from crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers other thin film solar module manufacturers and companies developing solar thermal and concentrated photovoltaic technologies 

 

even if demand for solar modules continues to grow the rapid expansion plans of many solar cell and module manufacturers could create periods where supply exceeds demand in addition we believe the significant decrease in the cost of silicon feedstock will provide significant reductions in the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules and lead to pricing pressure for solar modules and potentially the oversupply of solar modules including in key markets such as germany and spain 

 

during any such period our competitors could decide to reduce their sales price even below their manufacturing cost in order to generate sales as a result we may be unable to sell our solar modules at attractive prices or for a profit during any period of excess supply of solar modules which would reduce our net sales and adversely affect our results of operations also we may decide to lower our average selling price to certain customers in certain markets in response to competition 

 

thin film technology has a short history and our thin film technology and solar modules may perform below expectations problems with product quality or performance may cause us to incur warranty expenses damage our market reputation and prevent us from maintaining or increasing our market share 

 

researchers began developing thin film semiconductor technology over 20 years ago but were unable to integrate the technology into a solar module production line until recently our oldest active production line has only been in operation since november 2004 and the oldest solar modules manufactured during the qualification of 

our pilot line have only been in use since 2001 as a result our thin film technology and solar modules do not have a sufficient operating history to confirm how our solar modules will perform over their estimated 25year useful life we perform a variety of quality and life tests under different conditions however if our thin film technology and solar modules perform below expectations we could lose customers and face substantial warranty expense 

 

our solar modules are sold with a five year materials and workmanship warranty for technical defects and a twentyfive year warranty against declines of more than 10 of their initial rated power in the first 10 years following their installation and 20 of initial rated power in the following 15 years respectively as a result we bear the risk of extensive warranty claims long after we have sold our solar modules and recognized net sales as of december 27 2008 our accrued warranty liability was 119 million of which 40 million was classified as current and 79 million was classified as noncurrent 

 

while our power output warranty extends for twentyfive years our oldest solar modules manufactured during the qualification of our pilot production line have only been in use since 2001 because of the limited operating history of our solar modules we have been required to make assumptions regarding the durability and reliability of our solar modules our assumptions could prove to be materially different from the actual performance of our solar modules causing us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective solar modules in the future for example our glassonglass solar modules could break delaminate or experience power degradation in excess of expectations any widespread product failures may damage our market reputation and cause our sales to decline and require us to repair or replace the defective modules which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

 

if our estimates regarding the future cost of collecting and recycling our solar modules are incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses at and from the time we realize our estimates are incorrect and face a significant unplanned cash burden when our endusers return their solar modules 

 

we prefund our estimated future obligation for collecting and recycling our solar modules based on the present value of the expected future cost of collecting and recycling the modules which includes the cost of packaging the solar modules for transport the cost of freight from the solar module’s installation site to a recycling center the material labor and capital costs of the recycling process and an estimated thirdparty profit margin and return on risk for collection and recycling we base our estimate on our experience collecting and recycling solar modules that do not pass our quality control tests and solar modules returned under our warranty and on our expectations about future developments in recycling technologies and processes and about economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled if our estimates prove incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses at and from the time we realize our estimates are incorrect and also face a significant unplanned cash burden at the time we realize our estimates are incorrect or endusers return their solar modules which could harm our operating results in addition our endusers can return their solar modules at any time as a result we could be required to collect and recycle our solar modules earlier than we expect and before recycling technologies and processes improve 

 

our failure to further refine our technology and develop and introduce improved photovoltaic products could render our solar modules uncompetitive or obsolete and reduce our net sales and market share 

 

we will need to invest significant financial resources in research and development to keep pace with technological advances in the solar energy industry however research and development activities are inherently uncertain and we could encounter practical difficulties in commercializing our research results our significant expenditures on research and development may not produce corresponding benefits other companies are developing a variety of competing photovoltaic technologies including copper indium gallium diselenide and amorphous silicon which could produce solar modules that prove more costeffective or have better performance than our solar modules as a result our solar modules may be rendered obsolete by the technological advances of our competitors which could reduce our net sales and market share 

if photovoltaic technology is not suitable for widespread adoption or if sufficient demand for solar modules does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate our net sales may flatten or decline and we may be unable to sustain profitability 

 

the solar energy market is at a relatively early stage of development and the extent to which solar modules will be widely adopted is uncertain if photovoltaic technology proves unsuitable for widespread adoption or if demand for solar modules fails to develop sufficiently we may be unable to grow our business or generate sufficient net sales to sustain profitability in addition demand for solar modules in our targeted markets — including germany spain france italy and the united states — may not develop or may develop to a lesser extent than we anticipate many factors may affect the viability of widespread adoption of photovoltaic technology and demand for solar modules including the following 

 

  

reduced growth in or the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives and other support for ongrid solar electricity applications could reduce demand for our solar modules lead to a reduction in our net sales and adversely impact our operating results 

 

reduced growth in or the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives and other support for ongrid solar electricity may result in the diminished competitiveness of solar energy relative to conventional and nonsolar renewable sources of energy and could materially and adversely affect the growth of the solar energy industry and our net sales we believe that the nearterm growth of the market for ongrid applications where solar energy is used to supplement the electricity a consumer purchases from the utility network depends significantly on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives federal state and local governmental bodies in many countries most notably germany italy spain france greece portugal south korea japan canada and the united states have provided subsidies in the form of feedin tariffs rebates tax incentives and other incentives to endusers distributors systems integrators and manufacturers of photovoltaic products many of these government incentives expire phase out over time or require renewal by the applicable authority 

 

for example the german renewable energy law or the eeg has recently been modified by the german government feedintariffs were significantly reduced compared with the former legislation the amended law became effective january 1 2009 german subsidies now decline at a rate of between 80 and 10 in 2009 based on the type of the photovoltaic system instead of between 5 and 65 prior to effective date of the amendment the rate of decrease is subject to change based on the overall market growth for example the rate of decrease in feedintariffs in 2010 will be increased by 1 in case the market will be larger than 1500 mw or decreased by 1 if it is smaller than 1000 mw the next review of feedintariffs is scheduled for 2012 however earlier adjustments 

are possible if the german government reduces or eliminates the subsidies under the eeg demand for photovoltaic products could significantly decline in germany 

 

in spain which accounted for approximately 6 of our net sales the spanish government published a new decree for photovoltaics on september 27 2008 which became effective on september 28 2008 the new legislation replaces the previous decree from which it differs in some basic respects it distinguishes between system types namely between roofmounted and groundmounted systems it implements a flexible mechanism that links the feedintariffs to market development along with annual caps and it introduces a mechanism of licenses for installations that will be given out in four quarterly rounds per annum the decree fixed an initial annual cap of 400 mw of which 267 mw is reserved for roof installations and 133 mw for groundmounted systems for 2009 and 2010 additional volumes of 100 mw and 60 mw respectively are reserved for groundmounted systems a decision about a new compensation structure is not expected before 2012 with the annual market expansion capped for the next three years and feedintariffs significantly reduced under the revised spanish royal decree demand for photovoltaic products in spain is expected to decline significantly 

 

in the united states california has been the state where the majority of solar installations have taken place during the past five years starting january 1 2007 the california solar initiative csi has established a goal of installing 3000mw of solar generation capacity by 2016 with a state budget of 22 billion over 10 years the incentive level available to a given project is determined by the currently available incentive in each utility territory for each customer class the csi was designed so that the incentive level decreases over ten steps after which it goes to 0 as the total demand for solar energy grows 

 

in october 2008 the united states congress extended the 30 federal investment tax credit for both residential and commercial solar installations for eight years through december 31 2016 on february 17 2009 the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 was signed into law in addition to adopting certain fiscal stimulus measures that could benefit ongrid solar electricity applications this act creates a new program through the department of the treasury which provides grants equal to 30 of the cost of solar installations that are placed into service during 2009 and 2010 or that begin construction prior to december 31 2010 and are placed into service by january 1 2017 this grant is available in lieu of receiving the 30 federal investment tax credit other measures adopted by the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 that could benefit ongrid solar electricity generation include the following 1 a department of energy loan guarantee program for renewable energy projects renewable energy manufacturing facilities and electric power transmission projects and 2 a 30 investment credit for assets used to manufacture technology for the production of renewable energy 

 

emerging subsidy programs such as the programs in italy france greece south korea and ontario canada may require an extended period of time to attain effectiveness because the applicable permitting and grid connection processes associated with these programs can be lengthy and administratively burdensome 

 

in addition if any of these statutes or regulations is found to be unconstitutional or is reduced or discontinued for other reasons sales of our solar modules in these countries could decline significantly which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations for example the predecessor to the german eeg was challenged in germany on constitutional grounds and in the european court of justice as impermissible state aid although the german federal high court of justice dismissed these constitutional concerns and the european court of justice held that the purchase requirement at minimum feedin tariffs did not constitute impermissible state aid new proceedings challenging the german eeg or comparable minimum price regulations in other countries in which we currently operate or intend to operate may be initiated 

 

electric utility companies or generators of electricity from fossil fuels or other renewable energy sources could also lobby for a change in the relevant legislation in their markets to protect their revenue streams reduced growth in or the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar energy applications especially those in our target markets could cause our net sales to decline and materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

many of our key raw materials and components are either solesourced or sourced by a limited number of thirdparty suppliers and their failure to perform could cause manufacturing delays and impair our 

ability to deliver solar modules to customers in the required quality and quantities and at a price that is profitable to us 

 

our failure to obtain raw materials and components that meet our quality quantity and cost requirements in a timely manner could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture our solar modules or increase our manufacturing cost many of our key raw materials and components are either solesourced or sourced by a limited number of thirdparty suppliers as a result the failure of any of our suppliers to perform could disrupt our supply chain and impair our operations in addition many of our suppliers are small companies that may be unable to supply our increasing demand for raw materials and components as we implement our planned rapid expansion we may be unable to identify new suppliers or qualify their products for use on our production lines in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms raw materials and components from new suppliers may also be less suited for our technology and yield solar modules with lower conversion efficiencies higher failure rates and higher rates of degradation than solar modules manufactured with the raw materials from our current suppliers a constraint on our production may cause us to be unable to meet our obligations under our long term supply contracts which would have an adverse impact on our financial results 

 

a disruption in our supply chain for cadmium telluride our semiconductor material could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture solar modules 

 

a key raw material we use in our production process is a cadmium telluride compound tellurium is mainly produced as a byproduct of copper refining and its supply is therefore dependent upon demand for copper currently we purchase these raw materials from a limited number of suppliers if our current suppliers or any of our future suppliers are unable to perform under their contracts or purchase orders our operations could be interrupted or impaired in addition because our suppliers must undergo a lengthy qualification process we may be unable to replace a lost supplier in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms our supply of cadmium telluride could also be limited if any of our current suppliers or any of our future suppliers is unable to acquire an adequate supply of tellurium in a timely manner or at commercially reasonable prices if our competitors begin to use or increase their demand for cadmium telluride supply could be reduced and prices could increase if our current suppliers or any of our future suppliers cannot obtain sufficient tellurium they could substantially increase prices or be unable to perform under their contracts we may be unable to pass increases in the cost of our raw materials through to our customers because our customer contracts do not adjust for raw material price increases and are generally for a longer term than our raw material supply contracts a reduction in our production could result in our inability to meet our commitments under our long term supply contracts all of which would have an adverse impact on our financial results 

 

our future success depends on our ability to build new manufacturing plants and add production lines in a costeffective manner both of which are subject to risks and uncertainties 

 

our future success depends on our ability to significantly increase both our manufacturing capacity and production throughput in a costeffective and efficient manner if we cannot do so we may be unable to expand our business decrease our cost per watt maintain our competitive position satisfy our contractual obligations or sustain profitability our ability to expand production capacity is subject to significant risks and uncertainties including the following 

 

 16 

 

  

if our future production lines are not built in line with our committed schedules or do not achieve operating metrics similar to our existing production lines our solar modules could perform below expectations and cause us to lose customers 

 

currently our production lines have a limited history of operating at full capacity future production lines could produce solar modules that have lower efficiencies higher failure rates and higher rates of degradation than solar modules from our existing production lines and we could be unable to determine the cause of the lower operating metrics or develop and implement solutions to improve performance the second and third production lines at our ohio plant completed in august 2006 represent a “standard building block” that we replicated twice to build the four production lines at our german plant we are using the same systematic replication process to build our malaysian manufacturing center and future production facilities including expansion of our existing production facilities our replication risk in connection with building production lines at our malaysian manufacturing center and other future manufacturing plants could be higher than our replication risk was in expanding the ohio plant because these new production lines are located internationally which could entail other factors that will lower their operating metrics if we are unable to systematically replicate our production lines to meet our committed schedules and achieve and sustain similar operating metrics in our malaysian manufacturing center and future production lines as we have achieved at our existing production lines our manufacturing capacity could be substantially constrained our manufacturing costs per watt could increase and we could lose customers causing lower net sales higher liabilities and lower net income than we anticipate in addition we might be unable to produce enough solar modules to satisfy our contractual requirements under our long term supply contracts 

 

some of our manufacturing equipment is customized and sole sourced if our manufacturing equipment fails or if our equipment suppliers fail to perform under their contracts we could experience production disruptions and be unable to satisfy our contractual requirements 

 

some of our manufacturing equipment is customized to our production lines based on designs or specifications that we provide to the equipment manufacturer which then undertakes a specialized process to manufacture the custom equipment as a result the equipment is not readily available from multiple vendors and would be difficult to repair or replace if it were to become damaged or stop working if any piece of equipment fails production along the entire production line could be interrupted and we could be unable to produce enough solar modules to satisfy our contractual requirements under our long term supply contracts in addition the failure of our equipment suppliers to supply equipment in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms could delay our expansion plans and otherwise disrupt our production schedule or increase our manufacturing costs all of which would adversely impact our financial results 

 

if we are unable to further increase the number of sellable watts per solar module and reduce our manufacturing cost per watt we will be in default under certain of our long term supply contracts and our profitability could decline 

 

our long term supply contracts either 1 require us to increase the minimum average number of watts per module over the term of the contract or 2 have a price adjustment for increases or decreases in the number of watts per module relative to a base number of watts per module our failure to achieve these metrics could reduce our profitability or allow some of our customers to terminate their contracts in addition all of our long term supply contracts specify a sales price per watt that declines by approximately 65 at the beginning of each year through the expiration date of each contract in 2012 our profitability could decline if we are unable to reduce our manufacturing cost per watt by at least the same rate at which our contractual prices decrease furthermore our failure to reduce cost per watt by increasing our efficiency may impair our ability to enter new markets that we believe will require lower cost per watt for us to be competitive and may impair our growth plans 

existing regulations and policies and changes to these regulations and policies may present technical regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of photovoltaic products which may significantly reduce demand for our solar modules 

 

the market for electricity generation products is heavily influenced by foreign federal state and local government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry as well as policies promulgated by electric utilities these regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customerowned electricity generation in the united states and in a number of other countries these regulations and policies have been modified in the past and may be modified again in the future these regulations and policies could deter enduser purchases of photovoltaic products and investment in the research and development of photovoltaic technology for example without a mandated regulatory exception for photovoltaic systems utility customers are often charged interconnection or standby fees for putting distributed power generation on the electric utility grid these fees could increase the cost to our endusers of using photovoltaic systems and make them less desirable thereby harming our business prospects results of operations and financial condition in addition electricity generated by photovoltaic systems mostly competes with expensive peak hour electricity rather than the less expensive average price of electricity modifications to the peak hour pricing policies of utilities such as to a flat rate would require photovoltaic systems to achieve lower prices in order to compete with the price of electricity from other sources 

 

we anticipate that our solar modules and their installation will be subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with national and local ordinances relating to building codes safety environmental protection utility interconnection and metering and related matters it is difficult to track the requirements of individual states and design equipment to comply with the varying standards any new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to our solar modules may result in significant additional expenses to us our resellers and their customers and as a result could cause a significant reduction in demand for our solar modules 

 

environmental obligations and liabilities could have a substantial negative impact on our financial condition cash flows and profitability 

 

our operations involve the use handling generation processing storage transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations at the national state local and international level these environmental laws and regulations include those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the use management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites and occupational health and safety we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs and capital expenditures in complying with these laws and regulations in addition violations of or liabilities under environmental laws or permits may result in restrictions being imposed on our operating activities or in our being subjected to substantial fines penalties criminal proceedings third party property damage or personal injury claims cleanup costs or other costs while we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements future developments such as more aggressive enforcement policies the implementation of new more stringent laws and regulations or the discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

in addition our products contain cadmium telluride and cadmium sulfide elemental cadmium and certain of its compounds are regulated as hazardous due to the adverse health effects that may arise from human exposure although the risks of exposure to cadmium telluride are not believed to be as serious as those relating to exposure to elemental cadmium the chemical physical and toxicological properties of cadmium telluride have not been thoroughly investigated and reported we maintain engineering controls to minimize our associate’s exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds and require our associates who handle cadmium compounds to follow certain safety procedures including the use of personal protective equipment such as respirators chemical goggles and protective clothing in addition we believe the risk of exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds from our endproducts is limited by the fully encapsulated nature of these materials in our products the physical properties of cadmium compounds used in our products as well as the implementation in 2005 of our end of life collection and recycling program for our solar modules while we believe that these factors and procedures are sufficient to protect our associates endusers and the general public from cadmium exposure we cannot assure that human or 

environmental exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds used in our products will not occur any such exposure could result in future thirdparty claims against us as well as damage to our reputation and heightened regulatory scrutiny of our products which could limit or impair our ability to sell and distribute our products the occurrence of future events such as these could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

the use of cadmium in various products is also coming under increasingly stringent governmental regulation future regulation in this area could impact the manufacture sale collection and recycling of cadmiumcontaining solar modules and could require us to make unforeseen environmental expenditures or limit our ability to sell and distribute our products for example the european union directive 200296ec on waste electrical and electronic equipment or the “weee directive” requires manufacturers of certain electrical and electronic equipment to be financially responsible for the collection recycling treatment and disposal of specified products sold in the european union in addition european union directive 200295ec on the restriction of the use of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment or the “rohs directive” restricts the use of certain hazardous substances including cadmium in specified products other jurisdictions are considering adopting similar legislation currently photovoltaic solar modules in general are not subject to the weee or rohs directives however these directives allow for future amendments subjecting additional products to their requirements and the scope applicability and the products included in the weee and rohs directives may change in december 2008 the european commission issued its planned revisions of both the weee and rohs directives the revisions did not include photovoltaic solar modules in the scope of either directive the revisions will now be considered by both the european parliament and the eu members states as part of the normal european union legislative process which is likely to take one to two years if in the future our solar modules become subject to requirements of the weee and rohs directives we may be required to apply for an exemption if we were unable to obtain an exemption we would be required to redesign our solar modules in order to continue to offer them for sale within the european union which would be impractical failure to comply with these directives could result in the imposition of fines and penalties the inability to sell our solar modules in the european union competitive disadvantages and loss of net sales all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions and integration of these acquisitions may disrupt our business and management 

 

in november 2007 we acquired turner renewable energy llc and in the future we may acquire additional companies products or technologies we may not realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition and each acquisition has numerous risks these risks include the following 

 

 19 

 

  

mergers and acquisitions of companies are inherently risky and ultimately if we do not complete the integration of acquired businesses successfully and in a timely manner we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions to the extent anticipated which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

we may be unable to manage the expansion of our operations effectively 

 

we expect to expand our business significantly in order to meet our contractual obligations satisfy demand for our solar modules and increase market share in august 2006 we expanded our ohio plant from one to three production lines in april 2007 we started initial production at our four line manufacturing plant in germany which reached full capacity in the third quarter of 2007 also in april 2007 we began construction of plant one of our malaysian manufacturing center in the third and fourth quarters of 2007 we began construction of plants two and three respectively and in the first quarter of 2008 we began construction of plant four in the second half of 2008 we started construction of a one line expansion at our plant in ohio following the completion of plant four of our malaysian manufacturing center and the expansion of our ohio plant we will have grown from one production line to 24 production lines with an annual global manufacturing capacity of approximately 1145mw in four years based on the fourth quarter of 2008 average per line run rate at our existing plants 

 

to manage the rapid expansion of our operations we will be required to improve our operational and financial systems procedures and controls and expand train and manage our growing associate base our management will also be required to maintain and expand our relationships with customers suppliers and other third parties and attract new customers and suppliers in addition our current and planned operations personnel systems and internal procedures and controls might be inadequate to support our future growth if we cannot manage our growth effectively we may be unable to take advantage of market opportunities execute our business strategies or respond to competitive pressures 

 

our substantial international operations subject us to a number of risks including unfavorable political regulatory labor and tax conditions in foreign countries 

 

we have significant marketing distribution and manufacturing operations both within and outside the united states in 2008 94 of our net sales were generated from customers headquartered in the european union in the future we expect to expand our operations in other european and asian countries and as a result we will be subject to the legal political social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions risks inherent to international operations include but are not limited to the following 

 

 20 

 

  

our business in foreign markets requires us to respond to rapid changes in market conditions in these countries our overall success as a global business depends in part on our ability to succeed in differing legal regulatory economic social and political conditions we may not be able to develop and implement policies and strategies that will be effective in each location where we do business 

 

our future success depends on our ability to retain our key associates and to successfully integrate them into our management team 

 

we are dependent on the services of michael j ahearn our chief executive officer bruce sohn our president jens meyerhoff our chief financial officer john carrington our executive vice president global marketing and business development john t gaffney our executive vice president and other members of our senior management team the loss of messrs ahearn sohn meyerhoff carrington gaffney or any other member of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on us there is a risk that we will not be able to retain or replace these key associates several of our current key associates including messrs ahearn sohn meyerhoff carrington and gaffney are subject to employment conditions or arrangements that contain postemployment noncompetition provisions however these arrangements permit the associates to terminate their employment with us upon little or no notice 

 

if we are unable to attract train and retain key personnel our business may be materially and adversely affected 

 

our future success depends to a significant extent on our ability to attract train and retain management operations and technical personnel recruiting and retaining capable personnel particularly those with expertise in the photovoltaic industry and thin film technology are vital to our success there is substantial competition for qualified technical personnel and we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain our technical personnel if we are unable to attract and retain qualified associates our business may be materially and adversely affected 

 

our failure to protect our intellectual property rights may undermine our competitive position and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against thirdparty allegations of infringement may be costly 

 

protection of our proprietary processes methods and other technology especially our proprietary vapor transport deposition process and laser scribing process is critical to our business failure to protect and monitor the use of our existing intellectual property rights could result in the loss of valuable technologies we rely primarily on patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights and other contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property as of december 27 2008 we held 23 patents in the united states which will expire at various times between 2009 and 2026 and had 37 patent applications pending we also held 17 patents and had over 70 patent applications pending in foreign jurisdictions our existing patents and future patents could be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable we have pending patent applications in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents or if patents are issued to us such 

patents may not be sufficient to provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies 

 

we also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our associates and third parties to protect our intellectual property such confidentiality agreements are limited in duration and could be breached and may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary manufacturing expertise adequate remedies may not be available in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise in addition others may obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or legal means the failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes equipment technology trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise methods and compounds could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries especially any developing countries into which we may expand our operations in some countries we have not applied for patent trademark or copyright protection 

 

third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary technologies or other intellectual property rights which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology can be difficult and expensive also litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others we cannot assure you that the outcome of such potential litigation will be in our favor such litigation may be costly and may divert management attention and other resources away from our business an adverse determination in any such litigation will impair our intellectual property rights and may harm our business prospects and reputation in addition we have no insurance coverage against litigation costs and would have to bear all costs arising from such litigation to the extent we are unable to recover them from other parties 

 

we may be exposed to infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties which if determined adversely to us could cause us to pay significant damage awards or prohibit us from the manufacture and sale of our solar modules or the use of our technology 

 

our success depends largely on our ability to use and develop our technology and knowhow without infringing or misappropriating the intellectual property rights of third parties the validity and scope of claims relating to photovoltaic technology patents involve complex scientific legal and factual considerations and analysis and therefore may be highly uncertain we may be subject to litigation involving claims of patent infringement or violation of intellectual property rights of third parties the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits patent opposition proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings can be both costly and time consuming and may significantly divert the efforts and resources of our technical and management personnel an adverse determination in any such litigation or proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liability to third parties require us to seek licenses from third parties which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all or pay ongoing royalties require us to redesign our solar module or subject us to injunctions prohibiting the manufacture and sale of our solar modules or the use of our technologies protracted litigation could also result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of our solar modules until the resolution of such litigation 

 

currency translation and transaction risk may negatively affect our net sales cost of sales and gross margins and could result in exchange losses 

 

although our reporting currency is the us dollar we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most countries in which we operate as a result we are subject to currency translation and transaction risk for example 95 and 988 of our net sales were outside the united states and denominated in euro for the fiscal years ended december 27 2008 and december 29 2007 respectively and we expect a large percentage of our net sales to be outside the united states and denominated in foreign currencies in the future in addition with the expansion of our manufacturing operations into germany and malaysia our operating expenses for the plants in these countries will be denominated in the local currency changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar could affect our net sales and cost of sales and could result in exchange gains or losses for 

example the strengthening euro contributed 689 million to our net sales during fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 in addition we incur currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from our reporting currency for example our long term supply contracts specify fixed pricing in euro through 2012 and do not adjust for changes in the us dollar to euro exchange rate we cannot accurately predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations 

 

we could also expand our business into emerging markets many of which have an uncertain regulatory environment relating to currency policy conducting business in such emerging markets could cause our exposure to changes in exchange rates to increase 

 

the estate of john t walton and its affiliates have significant control over us and their interests may conflict with or differ from interests of other stockholder 

 

our current majority stockholder the estate of john t walton and its affiliates including jcl holdings llc owned 406 of our outstanding common stock at december 27 2008 as a result the estate of john t walton and its affiliates have substantial influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of our directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions such as mergers tender offers and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets in addition our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that unless and until the estate of john t walton jcl holdings llc john t walton’s surviving spouse descendants any entity including a trust that is for the benefit of john t walton’s surviving spouse or descendants or any entity including a trust over which any of john t walton’s surviving spouse descendants or siblings has voting or dispositive power collectively the “estate” collectively owns less than 40 of our common stock then outstanding stockholders holding 40 or more of our common stock then outstanding may call a special meeting of the stockholders at which our stockholders could replace our board of directors in addition unless and until the estate collectively owns less than 40 of our common stock then outstanding stockholder action may be taken by written consent the interests of the estate could conflict with or differ from interests of other stockholders for example the concentration of ownership held by the estate could delay defer or prevent a change of control of our company or impede a merger takeover or other business combination which a majority of stockholders may view favorably 

 

if our goodwill or investment in related party becomes impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 

 

we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or investment in a related party is determined resulting in an impact on our results of operations 

 

under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america we review our amortizable intangible assets and investment in related party for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization a decline in projections of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of turner renewable energy llc in november 2007 was 334 million 

 

in october 2008 we made an equity investment in a company based in the united states that supplies solar power plants to commercial and residential customers at a total cost of 250 million this investment represents an ownership of approximately 12 of the voting interest in this company and is our only equity interest in that entity since our ownership interest in this company is less than 20 and we do not exercise significant influence over it we account for this investment using the cost method of accounting

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k in addition to historical consolidated financial information the following discussion and analysis contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks uncertainties and assumptions as described under the “note regarding forwardlooking statements” that appears earlier in this annual report on form 10k our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forwardlooking statements as a result of many factors including those discussed under “item 1a risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

 

we design and manufacture solar modules using a proprietary thin film semiconductor technology that has allowed us to reduce our average solar module manufacturing costs to among the lowest in the world each solar module uses a thin layer of cadmium telluride semiconductor material to convert sunlight into electricity we manufacture our solar modules on highthroughput production lines and we perform all manufacturing steps ourselves in an automated proprietary continuous process during 2006 2007 and 2008 we sold most of our solar modules to solar power system developers system integrators and operators headquartered in germany france and spain 

 

currently we manufacture our solar modules at our perrysburg ohio frankfurtoder germany and kulim malaysia manufacturing facilities and conduct our research and development activities at our perrysburg ohio manufacturing facility our average manufacturing cost per watt has decreased from 294 during 2004 to 108 during 2008 we define average manufacturing cost per watt as the total manufacturing cost incurred during a period divided by the total watts produced during that period by continuing to expand production globally and improve our technology and manufacturing process we believe that we can further reduce our manufacturing costs per watt 

 

we were founded in 1999 to bring an advanced thin film semiconductor process into commercial production through the acquisition of predecessor technologies and the initiation of a research development and production program that allowed us to improve upon the predecessor technologies and launch commercial operations in january 2002 

 

on february 22 2006 we were incorporated as a delaware corporation prior to that date we operated as a delaware limited liability company 

 

on november 30 2007 we completed the acquisition of turner renewable energy llc a privately held company which designed and deployed commercial solar projects for utilities and fortune 500 companies in the united states we have integrated the operations from this acquisition into our solar power systems and project development business this business sells solar power systems directly to system owners these systems include both our solar modules and balance of system components that we procure from third parties we also sell integrated services related to the development of commercial solar projects in the united states such as the system design engineering procurement of permits and balance of system components construction management monitoring and maintenance as part of a system solution delivery this acquisition has created a platform for our systems business in north america to deliver solar electricity solutions to utility companies the total consideration for the transaction was 343 million excluding exit and transaction costs of 07 million consisting of 280 million in common stock and 63 million in cash see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements 

 

our fiscal year ends on the saturday on or before december 31 all references to fiscal year 2008 relate to the 52 weeks ended december 27 2008 all references to fiscal year 2007 relate to the 52 weeks ended december 29 2007 and all references to fiscal year 2006 relate to the 52 weeks ended december 30 2006 we use a 13 week fiscal quarter 

 

manufacturing capacity 

 

as of december 27 2008 we operated 19 production lines at our plants in perrysburg ohio frankfurtoder germany and kulim malaysia after completion of plant four at our malaysian manufacturing center and the expansion of our perrysburg ohio plant we will have 24 production lines with an annual global manufacturing capacity of approximately 1145 mw based on the fourth quarter of 2008 run rate at our existing plants 

 

financial operations overview 

 

the following describes certain line items in our statement of operations and some of the factors that affect our operating results 

net sales 

 

we generate substantially all of our net sales from the sale of solar modules we price and sell our solar modules per watt of power as a result our net sales can fluctuate based on our output of sellable watts or price we currently sell almost all of our solar modules to solar power system project developers system integrators and operators headquartered in germany france and spain which either resell our solar modules to endusers or integrate them into power plants that they own or operate or sell 

 

the solar industry has been moving from a supply driven to a demand driven industry with increasing competitive pressure as the supply of solar modules exceeds current demand our customers face significant challenges under the current economic conditions including an increase in interest or lending rates or tightening of the supply of capital to finance solar projects our net sales could be adversely impacted if legislation reduces the current subsidy programs in europe north america or asia or if interest rates increase or financing is no longer available which could impact our endusers’ ability to either meet their target return on investment or finance their projects in addition subsidies for our customers particularly in germany are declining at a rate that is greater than the annual contractual price decline we extend under our long term supply contracts as result we may be less competitive and not meet our customers internal rate of return irr or the profit margin of our customers might decline which could lower demand for our solar panels 

 

our sales prices under the long term supply contracts are denominated in euro exposing us to risks from currency exchange rate fluctuations approximately 95 of our sales are denominated in euro and subject to fluctuation in the exchange rate between the euro and us dollar for example the strengthening of the euro during 2008 increased our net sales by 6 in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

 

in april 2006 we entered into longterm contracts for the purchase and sale of our solar modules with six european solar power system project developers and system integrators and in 2007 we entered into additional longterm contracts for the purchase and sale of our solar modules with six other european project developers that also own and operate renewable energy projects in 2008 we entered into longterm contracts with three european project developers system integrators and operators and increased our contracted volume with four customers we also entered into a fiveyear agreement with a solar power system project developer and system integrator in the united states which is a related party these contracts account for a significant portion of our planned production over the period from 2009 through 2013 and therefore will significantly affect our overall financial performance 

 

our long term supply contracts entered into in 2006 require us to deliver solar modules each year that in total meet or exceed a specified minimum average number of watts per module for the year under these long term supply contracts we are required to increase the minimum average number of watts per module by approximately 5 annually from 2008 to 2009 and then by 3 for modules delivered in 2012 if we are unable to meet the minimum average annual number of watts per module in a given year we will be in breach of the applicable agreements entitling our customers to certain remedies potentially including the right to terminate their long term supply contracts our long term supply contracts entered into in 2007 do not require a minimum average number of watts per module but provide for a base number of watts per module that increases 34 annually from 2008 to 20102011 and then remains fixed through 2012 and contain a price adjustment per watt if the watts delivered per module are higher or lower than the base number of watts per module as of december 27 2008 all of our long term supply contracts specify a sales price per watt that declines by approximately 65 at the beginning of each year through the expiration date of the contracts in 2012 because the sales prices under our long term supply contracts are fixed and have the builtin decline each year we cannot pass along any increases in manufacturing costs to these customers although we believe that our total manufacturing costs per watt will decline at the same rate or more rapidly than our prices under the long term supply contracts our failure to achieve our manufacturing cost per watt targets could result in a reduction of our gross profit 

 

our long term supply contracts in the aggregate allow for approximately 58 billion 49 billion denominated in euro at an assumed exchange rate of 115€100 and 02 billion denominated in usd in sales from 2009 to 2013 during 2008 we amended a long term supply contract with one customer which reduced the volume of solar modules delivered to such customer in 2008 and also reduced the volume of solar modules to be delivered over the remaining term of the agreement to such customer during february 2009 we amended our long term supply contracts with two customers to accelerate the decline in the sales price per watt under such contracts in 2009 and 

2010 in exchange for increases in the volume of solar modules to be delivered under such contracts we are currently in discussions with several other customers about making similar amendments to their long term supply contracts 

 

the annual decline in the sales price under our long term supply contracts will reduce our net sales by approximately 56 each year assuming that the rated power of our solar modules remains flat and will impact our cash flow accordingly as a result our profitability could decline if we are unable to reduce our manufacturing cost per watt by at least the same rate as the contractual sales prices decrease 

 

under our customer contracts starting in april 2006 we transfer title and risk of loss to the customer and recognize revenue upon shipment under our customer contracts in effect prior to april 1 2006 we did not transfer title or risk of loss or recognize revenue until the solar modules were received by our customers our customers do not have extended payment terms or rights of return under these contracts 

 

we have the right to terminate certain long term supply contracts upon 12 months notice and the payment of a termination fee if we determine that certain material adverse changes have occurred including depending on the contract one or more of the following new laws rules or regulations with respect to our production distribution installation or collection and recycling program have a substantial adverse impact on our business unanticipated technical or operational issues result in our experiencing widespread persistent quality problems or the inability to achieve stable conversion efficiencies at planned levels or extraordinary events beyond our control substantially increase the cost of our labor materials or utility expenses or significantly reduce our throughput the average termination fee under those agreements is 42 million ranging from 07 million to 80 million 

 

our customers are entitled to certain remedies in the event of missed deliveries of kilowatt volume these delivery commitments are established through rolling four quarter forecasts that are agreed to with each of the customers within the parameters established in the long term supply contracts and define the specific quantities to be purchased on a quarterly basis and the schedules of the individual shipments to be made to the customers in the case of a late delivery certain of our customers are entitled to a maximum charge representing a percentage of the delinquent revenue if we do not meet our annual minimum volume shipments our customers also have the right to terminate these contracts on a prospective basis 

 

with our acquisition of turner renewable energy llc on november 30 2007 we began accounting for a portion of our revenues using the percent of completion method of accounting revenues for our solar power systems and project development business for the years ended december 27 2008 and december 29 2007 were 537 million and 37 million respectively and were not material to our consolidated results of operations 

 

during 2008 our principal customers were blitzstrom gmbh colexon energy ag previously reinecke  pohl conergy ag juwi solar gmbh and phoenix solar ag during 2008 each of these five customers individually accounted for between 11 and 19 of our net sales all of our other customers individually accounted for less than 10 of our net sales during 2008 

 

cost of sales 

 

our cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials and components such as tempered back glass transparent conductive oxide tco coated front glass cadmium telluride laminate connector assemblies laminate edge seal and others other items contributing to our cost of sales are direct labor and manufacturing overhead such as engineering expense equipment maintenance environmental health and safety expenses quality and production control and procurement cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing plants and equipment and facilityrelated expenses in addition we accrue warranty and solar module endoflife collection and recycling costs to our cost of sales 

 

we implemented a program in 2005 to collect and recycle our solar modules after their use under our collection and recycling program we enter into an agreement with the endusers of the solar power systems that use our solar modules in the agreement we commit at our expense to remove the solar modules from the installation site at the end of their life and transport them to a processing center where the solar module materials and components will be either refurbished and resold as used panels or recycled to recover some of the raw materials in return the owner agrees not to dispose of the solar modules except through our endoflife collection and recycling 

program or another program that we approve of and the solar power system owner is responsible for disassembling the solar modules and packaging them in containers that we provide at the time we sell a solar module we record an expense in cost of sales equal to the fair value of the estimated future endoflife collection and recycling obligation we subsequently record accretion expense on this future obligation which we classify with selling general and administrative expense 

 

overall we expect our cost of sales per watt to decrease over the next several years due to an increase of sellable watts per solar module an increase in unit output per line geographic diversification into lowercost manufacturing regions and more efficient absorption of fixed costs driven by economies of scale 

 

deferred project costs represent uninstalled materials we have procured for customer projects we recognize these costs as deferred assets until we install the materials deferred project costs were 07 million at december 27 2008 

 

gross profit 

 

gross profit is affected by numerous factors including our average selling prices foreign exchange rates our manufacturing costs and the effective utilization of our production facilities for example our long term supply contracts specify a sales price per watt that declines 65 at the beginning of each year another factor impacting gross profits is the ramp of production on new plants due to a reduced ability to absorb fixed costs until full production volumes are reached as a result gross profits may vary from quarter to quarter and year to year 

 

research and development 

 

research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and personnelrelated costs and the cost of products materials and outside services used in our process and product research and development activities we continually add equipment for general use in further process developments and record the depreciation of this equipment as research and development expense we may also allocate a portion of the annual operating cost of the ohio expansion to research and development expense 

 

we maintain a number of programs and activities to improve our technology in order to enhance the performance of our solar modules and of our manufacturing processes we maintain active collaborations with the national renewable energy laboratory a division of the united states department of energy brookhaven national laboratory and several universities we report our research and development expense net of grant funding during the past four years we received grant funding that we applied towards our research and development programs we received 09 million 18 million and 09 million during the years ended december 27 2008 december 29 2007 and december 30 2006 respectively we expect our research and development expense to increase in absolute terms in the future as we increase personnel and research and development activity over time we expect research and development expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as a result of economies of scale 

 

selling general and administrative 

 

selling general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated costs professional fees insurance costs travel expense and other selling expenses we expect these expenses to increase in the near term both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales in order to support the growth of our business as we expand our sales and marketing efforts improve our information processes and systems and implement the financial reporting compliance and other infrastructure required for a public company over time we expect selling general and administrative expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as our net sales and our total watts produced increase 

 

production startup 

 

production startup expense consists primarily of salaries and personnelrelated costs and the cost of operating a production line before it has been qualified for full production including the cost of raw materials for solar modules run through the production line during the qualification phase it also includes all expenses related to the 

selection of a new site and the related legal and regulatory costs and the costs to maintain our plant replication program to the extent we cannot capitalize these expenditures production startup expenses during 2006 were 117 million due to the qualification of our ohio expansion and the planning and preparation for operation of our german plant we incurred production startup expense of 169 million during 2007 in connection with the qualification of the german plant and the planning and preparation of our plants at our malaysian manufacturing center production startup expense during 2008 was 325 million relating to the planning and preparation of our plants at the malaysian manufacturing center in general we expect production startup expense per production line to be higher when we build an entirely new manufacturing facility compared with the addition of new production lines at an existing manufacturing facility primarily due to the additional infrastructure investment required when building an entirely new facility we also expect to incur production startup expenses during 2009 related to our expansion of our perrysburg ohio manufacturing facility and plant four at the malaysian manufacturing center over time we expect production startup expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as a result of economies of scale 

 

interest income 

 

interest income is earned on our cash cash equivalents marketable securities and restricted cash 

 

interest expense net 

 

interest expense net of amounts capitalized is incurred on various debt financings 

 

foreign currency gain loss 

 

foreign currency gain loss consists of gains and losses resulting from holding assets and liabilities and conducting transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

in preparing our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap we make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts of reported assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities in our financial statements and the related notes thereto some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in the selection of appropriate assumptions for determining these estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty as a result we cannot assure you that actual results will not differ significantly from estimated results we base our judgments and estimates on our historical experience on our forecasts and on other available information as appropriate our significant accounting policies are further described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 27 2008 included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

 

our critical accounting policies and estimates which require the most significant management estimates and judgment in determining amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k are as follows 

 

revenue recognition we sell our products directly to solar power system integrators and operators and recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery of the product has occurred and title and risk of loss has passed to the customer the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured this policy is in accordance with the requirements of sec staff accounting bulletin no sab 101 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab 104 revision of topic 13 revenue recognition  under this policy we record a trade receivable for the selling price of our product and reduce inventory for the cost of goods sold when delivery occurs in accordance with the terms of the sales contract we do not offer extended payment terms or rights of return for our sold products 

 

with our acquisition of turner renewable energy llc on november 30 2007 a portion of our revenues will be derived from longterm contracts that we account for under the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants’ statement of position no sop 811 accounting for performance of constructiontype and 

certain productiontype contracts  accordingly we recognize revenue on longterm fixedprice contracts on the percentage of completion basis using the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at completion as the measurement basis for progress toward completion and revenue recognition if we identify any losses on contracts we will recognize those losses immediately contract accounting requires significant judgment in assessing risks estimating contract costs and making related assumptions for schedule and technical issues furthermore contract change orders claims and similar items require us to use judgment in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization we only include contract change orders claims and similar items in contract value when we can reliably estimate their amounts and can conclude that their realization is probable 

 

incurred costs include all direct material labor subcontractor cost and those indirect costs related to contract performance such as indirect labor supplies and tools we recognize job material costs as incurred costs when the job materials have been installed when contracts specify that title to job materials transfers to the customer before installation has been performed we defer revenue and recognize it upon installation using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting we consider job materials to be installed materials when they are permanently attached or fitted to the solar power systems as required by the engineering design 

 

our liability for “billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings” which is part of the balance sheet caption “other current liabilities” was 22 million and 21 million as of december 27 2008 and december 29 2007 respectively this liability represents our billings in excess of revenues recognized on our contracts which results from differences between contractual billing schedules and the timing of revenue recognition under our revenue recognition accounting policies 

 

we also have a limited number of revenue arrangements that include multiple deliverables these are contracts under which we provide design and consulting services for and we supply parts and equipment for solar power systems we follow the guidance in emerging issues task force issue no eitf 0021 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  in order to determine whether these arrangements have more than one unit of accounting according to eitf 0021 deliverable elements in a revenue arrangement with multiple deliverables are separate units of accounting if the elements have standalone value to the customer if objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered elements is available and if the arrangement does not include a general right of return related to delivered items we determined that our design and supply arrangements generally consist of two elements that qualify as separate units of accounting — the provision of design and consulting services and the supply of solar power system parts and equipment we apply the same revenue recognition principles from sab 104 as we use for our arrangements for the standalone sales of products to the recognition of revenue on the parts and equipment unit of accounting of our multiple deliverable arrangements we recognize revenue from the design and consulting services unit of accounting using the percentage of completion method in accordance with sop 811 

 

end of life collection and recycling at the time of sale we recognize an expense for the estimated fair value of our future obligation for collecting and recycling the solar modules that we have sold we base our estimate of the fair value of our collection and recycling obligations on the present value of the expected future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules which includes the cost of packaging the solar modules for transport the cost of freight from the solar module’s installation site to a recycling center the material labor and capital costs of the recycling process and an estimated thirdparty profit margin and return on risk for collection and recycling services we base this estimate on our experience collecting and recycling our solar modules and on our expectations about future developments in recycling technologies and processes and about economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled in the periods between the time of our sales and our settlement of the collection and recycling obligations we accrete the carrying amount of the associated liability by applying the discount rate used for its initial measurement at december 27 2008 our estimate of the fair value of our liability for collecting and recycling solar modules was 352 million a 10 percent decrease in our estimate of the future cost of collecting and recycling a solar module would reduce this estimated liability by 35 million to 317 million a 10 percent increase in our estimate of the future cost of collecting and recycling a solar module would increase this estimated liability by 35 million to 387 million 

 

product warranties we provide a limited warranty for defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions for five years following delivery to the owner of our solar modules we also warrant to the 

owner of our solar modules that solar modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 90 of their initial power output rating during the first 10 years following their installation and at least 80 of their initial power output rating during the following 15 years our warranties are automatically transferred from the original purchaser of our solar modules to a subsequent purchaser we accrue warranty costs when we recognize sales using amounts estimated based on our historical experience with warranty claims our monitoring of field installation sites and inhouse testing during the years ended december 30 2006 december 29 2007 and december 27 2008 our estimate of our product warranty liability did not require significant adjustments 

 

sharebased compensation in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no sfas 123r sharebased payment  which requires companies to recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options in their statements of operations based on the fair value of the awards on their grant dates we adopted sfas 123r during the first quarter of the year ended december 31 2005 using the “modified retrospective” method of transition in march 2005 the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no sab 107 which provides guidance regarding the implementation of sfas 123r in particular sab 107 provides guidance regarding calculating assumptions used in sharebased compensation valuation models the classification of sharebased compensation expense the capitalization of sharebased compensation costs and disclosures in management’s discussion and analysis in filings with the sec 

 

determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of sharebased awards at the date of grant using that valuation model requires judgment we use the blackscholesmerton valuation formula to estimate the fair value of employee stock options which is consistent with the provisions of sfas no 123r option pricing models including the blackscholesmerton formula require the use of input assumptions including expected volatility expected term expected dividend rate and expected riskfree rate of return because our stock has only recently become publicly traded we do not have a meaningful observable shareprice volatility therefore we estimate our expected volatility based on that of similar publiclytraded companies and expect to continue to do so until such time as we might have adequate historical data to refer to from our own traded share price we estimated our options’ expected terms using our best estimate of the period of time from the grant date that we expect the options to remain outstanding if we determine another method to estimate expected volatility or expected term is more reasonable than our current methods or if another method for calculating these input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance the fair value calculated for future sharebased awards could change significantly from those used for past awards even if the critical terms of the awards are similar higher volatility and expected terms result in an increase to sharebased compensation determined at the date of grant the expected dividend rate and expected riskfree rate of return are not as significant to the calculation of fair value 

 

in addition sfas no 123r requires us to develop an estimate of the number of sharebased awards which we expect to vest quarterly changes in our estimates of award forfeiture rates and further adjustments when the awards actually vest can have a significant effect on reported sharebased compensation increases to the estimated forfeiture rate will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements during the quarter of the change and future quarters decreases in the estimated forfeiture rate will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements during the quarter of the change and future quarters these adjustments affect our cost of sales research and development expenses selling general and administrative and production startup expenses the adjustments to our estimates of the number of sharebased awards that we expect to vest and further adjustments as certain awards completed their vesting period reduced our sharebased compensation expense by 06 million in the year ended december 30 2006 and increased our sharebased compensation expense by 29 million and 09 million in the years ended december 29 2007 and december 27 2008 respectively the expense we recognize in future periods could differ significantly from the current period andor our forecasts due to adjustments in the estimated number of sharebased awards that we expect to vest and further adjustments when the awards actually vest 

 

valuation of longlived assets our longlived assets include manufacturing equipment and facilities our business requires significant investment in manufacturing facilities that are technologically advanced but that may become obsolete through changes in our industry or the fluctuations in demand for our solar modules we account for any impairment of our longlived tangible assets and definitelived intangible assets in accordance with sfas 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets as a result we assess longlived assets 

classified as “held and used” including our property plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances arise that may indicate that the carrying amount of the longlived assets may not be recoverable these events would include significant current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of such losses significant changes in the manner of use of assets and significant negative industry or economic trends we evaluated our longlived assets for impairment during the years ended december 27 2008 and december 29 2007 and did not note any events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying values of material longlived assets are not recoverable 

 

accounting for income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the united states its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining our provision for income taxes and must also make estimates about when in the future certain items affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit we regularly assess the likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from current and subsequent years’ examinations and we record tax liabilities as appropriate 

 

we establish liabilities for potential losses that may arise out of tax audits in accordance with fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 109  once established we adjust the liabilities when there is more information available or when an event occurs requiring an adjustment significant judgment is required in making these estimates and the actual cost of a legal claim tax assessment or regulatory fine or penalty may ultimately be materially different from our recorded liabilities if any 

 

in preparing our consolidated financial statements we calculate our income tax expense based on our interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business this requires us to estimate our current tax obligations and the realizability of uncertain tax positions and to assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities the net current amount of which we show as a component of current assets or current liabilities and the net noncurrent amount of which we show as other assets or other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet we must also assess the likelihood that each of our deferred tax assets will be realized 

 

to the extent we believe that realization is not more likely than not we establish a valuation allowance when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a reporting period we generally record a corresponding tax expense in our consolidated statement of income conversely to the extent circumstances indicate that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary that portion of the valuation allowance is reversed which generally reduces our overall income tax expense see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about income taxes 

 

goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired companies over the estimated fair value assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed we do not amortize goodwill but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter and if necessary we would record any impairment in accordance with sfas 142 goodwill and other intangible assets we will perform an impairment review between scheduled annual tests if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill is less than its carrying value in the process of our annual impairment review we primarily use the income approach methodology of valuation which includes the discounted cash flow method and the market approach methodology of valuation which considers values of comparable businesses to determine the fair value of our goodwill significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results and the discount rates that we used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation and in the selection of comparable businesses that we used in the market approach 

 

we reported 338 million of goodwill at december 27 2008 which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net tangible and intangible assets that we acquired from turner renewable energy llc in accordance with sfas 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  we performed our annual test of our goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of the year ended december 27 2008 and concluded 

that it was not impaired testing goodwill for impairment involves two steps the first step is comparing the fair value of a reporting unit containing goodwill to its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value impairment is indicated and step two of the test must be performed that step involves determining the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to the fair values of its identifiable assets and liabilities any excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the net fair values of its identifiable assets and liabilities is attributed to goodwill and any amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds this implied fair value is written off as an impairment loss in our test during the fourth quarter of 2008 we determined that the fair value of our solar power systems reporting unit which contains all of our goodwill exceeded its carrying value by approximately 80 percent as a result we concluded that there was no indication that our goodwill was impaired and that performing step two of the goodwill impairment test was not applicable 

 

marketable securities we have classified our marketable securities as “availableforsale” and present them at fair value on our balance sheet with gains and losses recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income loss until realized we determine the realized gains and losses on sales of marketable securities using the specific identification cost method all of our availableforsale marketable securities are subject to a periodic impairment review we consider our marketable debt securities impaired when their fair value is less than their carrying value we subject investments identified as being impaired to further review to determine if the investment is other thantemporarily impaired in which case we would write down the investment to its impaired value and establish that amount as its new cost basis we measure the fair value of our marketable securities using quoted prices for securities with similar characteristics and other observable inputs such as interest rates that are observable at commonly quoted intervals and we consider the effect of our counterparties credit standings in these fair value measurements determining the observable market values most relevant to the measurement of the fair value of marketable securities and the further counterparty credit risk adjustment to those values if needed requires significant judgment changes in market conditions can also significantly affect the fair value measurements from period to period and can cause realized values to vary significantly from previous estimates 

 

valuation of derivative instruments we use derivative instruments to manage a variety of risks including currency exchange rate risk interest rate risk and credit risk we do not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes we believe that there are two aspects of accounting for our derivative instruments that require us to make significant estimates and judgments measuring the fair values of the derivative instruments and applying special “hedge accounting” rules to some of them 

 

we report our derivative instruments on our consolidated balance sheet at their fair values see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for information about how we measure the fair values of our derivative instruments we believe that the types of derivative instruments that we use are commonly used by many companies outside the financial services industry and have wellestablished valuation models which we apply also we believe that there are readily available reliable sources for the information that we need as inputs to these valuation models however the selection of the valuation models and the inputs we use in them still does require us to exercise significant judgment about their relevance to our measurement any adjustments that they may require to properly measure our particular derivative instruments and their reliability we also note that the amounts that we use as valuation model inputs can change significantly from one period to another as markets fluctuate this can cause the fair value that we estimate for any specific derivative instrument to vary significantly from one period to another 

 

we designate some of our derivative instruments as cashflow hedges pursuant to sfas 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  under cashflow hedge accounting we record the portion of the change in the fair value of a derivative instrument that offsets within a specified range the change in the fair value of the specified future cash flow that it hedges as a component of other comprehensive income until the hedged cash flow affects the computation of our current income at that time we reclassify this “effective portion” of the net change in the fair value of the derivative instrument to current income 

 

among other things cashflow hedge accounting requires us to test each hedging derivative instrument at the inception of the hedging relationship and at the end of each reporting period thereafter for its effectiveness in offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged cash flow if we determine that the overall hedging relationship is 

ineffective we must discontinue cashflow hedge accounting for the derivative instrument and record all its future fair value changes in current income sfas 133 also requires us to measure any portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument that is not effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged cash flow and record that measured ineffectiveness in our current income because of these requirements our estimates and judgments that affect the amounts that we measure for the fair value of our derivative instruments and the hedged cash flows can also have a significant impact on how we present changes in those fair values in our financial statements current income versus other comprehensive income 

 

results of operations 

 

the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december 27 2008 december 29 2007 and december 30 2006 

 

 

 

fiscal years ended december 27 2008 and december 29 2007 

 

net sales 

 

 

 

the increase in our net sales was due primarily to a 148 increase in the mw volume of solar modules sold during 2008 compared with 2007 due to strong demand for our solar modules in europe the increase in mw volume of solar modules sold is attributable to the full production ramp of our german plant commencement of product shipments at the first two plants at our malaysian manufacturing center and continued improvements to our manufacturing process in addition we increased the average number of sellable watts per solar module by approximately 4 during 2008 compared with 2007 our average selling price decreased by approximately 1 during 2008 compared with 2007 mainly due to a 65 contractual price decline partially offset by a 6 increase related to a favorable foreign exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro approximately 74 of our net sales during 2008 resulted from sales of solar modules to customers headquartered in germany 

cost of sales 

 

 

 

the increase in our cost of sales was due to higher production and sales volumes which resulted from the full production ramp of our german facility and commencement of production at our first three plants at our malaysian manufacturing center these factors caused a 1911 million increase in direct material expense a 138 million increase in warranty and end of life costs relating to the collection and recycling of our solar modules a 94 million increase in sales freight and other costs and a 1010 million increase in manufacturing overhead costs the increase in manufacturing overhead costs was due to a 405 million increase in salaries and personnel related expenses including a 24 million increase in sharebased compensation expense a 307 million increase in facility and related expenses and a 298 million increase in depreciation expense in each case primarily resulting from increased infrastructure associated with our german and malaysian expansions our cost of sales during 2008 reflects a benefit of 20 million resulting from a change in the estimated amount of our warranty obligation 

 

gross profit 

 

 

 

as a percentage of sales gross profit increased 45 percentage points from 2007 to 2008 representing increased leverage of our fixed cost infrastructure and scalability associated with our german and malaysian expansions which drove a 148 increase in the number of megawatts sold our average manufacturing cost per watt decreased by 9 during 2008 while our average selling prices decreased by 1 during 2008 foreign exchange gains due to a favorable exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro and increased leverage of our fixed cost infrastructure contributed approximately 19 and 56 respectively to our gross profit partially offset by a 30 decline in our average selling prices 

 

research and development 

 

 

 

the increase in our research and development expense was due to a 137 million increase in personnel related expense including a 12 million increase in sharebased compensation expense due to increased headcount and additional sharebased compensation awards in addition consulting and other expenses increased by 38 million and grant revenue increased by 09 million during 2008 compared with 2007 throughout 2008 we continued the development of solar modules with increased efficiencies at converting sunlight into electricity

the increase in selling general and administrative expense was due to a 620 million increase in salaries and personnelrelated expenses including a 155 million increase in sharebased compensation in addition legal and professional service fees increased by 130 million and other expenses increased by 168 million during 2008 the increase resulted primarily from the expansion of our solar power system and project development business as well as operating a global manufacturing business 

 

production startup 

 

 

 

during 2008 we incurred 325 million of production startup expenses for our ohio and malaysian manufacturing expansion including legal regulatory and personnel costs compared with 169 million of production startup expenses for our german and malaysian plant expansions during 2007 production startup expenses are primarily the cost of labor and material and depreciation expense to run and qualify the production lines related facility expenses management of our replication process and legal and regulatory costs 

 

foreign exchange gain 

 

 

 

foreign exchange gain increased by 38 million during 2008 due to a substantial increase in our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and high volatility of the us dollar relative to other currencies in particular the euro 

 

interest income 

 

 

 

interest income remained relatively flat primarily as a result of higher cash cash equivalents and marketable securities balances during 2008 offset by a decline in interest rates 

 

interest expense net 

 

 

 

interest expense net of amounts capitalized decreased primarily as a result of higher amounts of interest expense capitalized due to the construction of our malaysian manufacturing center 

 

other expense net 

 

 

other expense net consisted mainly of financing fees related to our credit facilities during 2008 other expense was reduced by a marktomarket gain of 06 million associated with our credit default swap 

 

income tax expense benefit 

 

 

 

income tax expense increased by 1178 million primarily due to the increase in pretax income of 3078 million as well as the reversal of a valuation allowance in 2007 of 549 million 

 

our malaysian subsidiary has been granted a tax holiday for a period of 165 years which was originally scheduled to commence on january 1 2009 which generally provides for a 100 exemption from malaysian income tax subsequent to year end we received formal approval granting our request to pull forward this previously approved tax holiday by one year due to the fact that this approval was granted subsequent to the end of 2008 we concluded that the financial impact will be reflected in our first quarter of 2009 financial results as a result we will recognize an income tax benefit of 116 million in the first quarter of 2009 had the exemption from malaysian tax against our 2008 income been granted during 2008 our 2008 income tax expense would have been reduced by 116 million to 1038 million the effective tax rate would have been 224 rather than 249 

 

fiscal years ended december 29 2007 and december 30 2006 

 

net sales 

 

 

 

the increase in our net sales was due primarily to a 259 increase in the mw volume of solar modules sold in 2007 compared to 2006 we were able to increase the mw volume of solar modules sold primarily as a result of the production ramp at our german plant the full production of our ohio expansion and continued improvements to our overall process in addition we increased the average number of sellable watts per solar module by approximately 11 in 2007 compared with 2006 our average selling price increased by 4 during 2007 compared with 2006 mainly due to a 9 increase related to a favorable foreign exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro partially offset by a 5 annual contractual price decline approximately 91 of our net sales in 2007 resulted from sales of solar modules to customers headquartered in germany 

 

cost of sales 

 

 

 

direct material expense increased by 873 million warranty and end of life costs relating to the collection and recycling of our solar modules increased by 91 million sales freight and other costs increased by 32 million in each case primarily as a result of higher production volumes in 2007 compared with 2006 in addition manufacturing overhead costs increased by 722 million which was primarily composed of an increase in salaries and personnel related expenses of 430 million including an increase in sharebased compensation expense from 42 million in 2006 to 95 million in 2007 resulting from the infrastructure associated with our ohio expansion and german plant buildout facility and related expenses of 160 million and depreciation expense of 132 million primarily as a result of additional equipment becoming operational at our ohio and german plants 

gross profit 

 

 

 

as a percentage of sales gross profit increased 97 percentage points from 2006 to 2007 representing increased leverage of our fixed cost infrastructure and scalability associated with our plant expansions which drove a 259 increase in the number of megawatts sold during 2007 foreign exchange gains due to a favorable exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro and increased leverage of our fixed cost infrastructure contributed 30 and 98 respectively to our gross profit partially offset by a 31 annual contractual price decline additionally we incurred 76 million of costs or 15 of revenues associated with the ramp of our german plant in 2007 compared with 11 million of costs or 08 of revenues incurred in 2006 related to the ramp of our ohio expansion 

 

research and development 

 

 

 

the increase in research and development expense was primarily the result of a 79 million increase in personnel related expense including an increase in sharebased compensation expense from 23 million in 2006 to 47 million in 2007 due to increased headcount and additional sharebased compensation awards consulting and other expenses also increased by 17 million and grant revenue increased by 09 million in 2007 compared to 2006 

 

selling general and administrative 

 

 

 

selling general and administrative expense increased primarily as a result of an increase in salaries and personnelrelated expenses of 361 million due to increased headcount and an increase in sharebased compensation from 53 million in 2006 to 234 million in 2007 in addition legal and professional service fees increased by 113 million and other expenses increased by 15 million during 2007 primarily resulting from costs incurred in connection with being a public company and infrastructure build out to support our growth 

 

production startup 

 

 

 

in 2007 we incurred 169 million of production startup expenses related to our german and malaysia expansions including legal regulatory and personnel costs compared with 117 million of production startup expenses for our ohio and german plant expansions during 2006 production startup expenses are primarily attributable to the cost of labor and material and depreciation expense to run and qualify the line related facility expenses management of our replication process and legal and regulatory costs 

foreign exchange gain 

 

 

 

foreign exchange gain decreased by 37 million from 2006 to 2007 primarily as a result of hedging the foreign exchange exposure in 2007 to mitigate some of the impact on the fluctuating dollar 

 

interest income 

 

 

 

the increase in interest income of 178 million was primarily due to increased interest income resulting from higher cash cash equivalent and marketable securities balances throughout 2007 we completed an initial public offering in the fourth quarter of 2006 which resulted in net proceeds of 3027 million and an equity followon public offering in the third quarter of 2007 which provided us with net proceeds of 3660 million we also had higher investments in 2007 compared to 2006 that generated interest at higher rates 

 

interest expense net 

 

 

 

interest expense net of amounts capitalized increased by 13 million from 2006 to 2007 primarily as a result of increased borrowings associated with our german plant financing in 2007 we capitalized 38 million of interest expense to construction in progress compared to 33 million in 2006 

 

other expense 

 

 

 

the increase in other expense of 04 million was primarily due to increased financing fees related to the ikb loans 

 

income tax expense benefit 

 

 

 

our 2007 tax rate was a benefit of 15 which primarily reflects the net of a tax rate of 337 and a rate benefit of 352 due to the reversal of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets of 549 million the reversal was based upon our updated assessment of the future realization of our deferred income tax assets the available positive evidence during fiscal 2007 included cumulative taxable income for the previous twelve quarters and a projection of future taxable income the income tax expense for 2006 was the result of a change in corporate form from a limited liability company to a corporation profitability in 2006 and a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

as of december 27 2008 we had 8218 million in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities compared with 6697 million as of december 29 2007 we believe that our current cash cash equivalents marketable securities cash flows from operating activities government grants and low interest debt financings for our german and malaysian plant will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures needs for at least the next 12 months however if our financial results or operating plans change from our current assumptions we may not have sufficient resources to support our business plan as a result we may engage in one or more debt or equity financings in the future which could result in increased expenses or dilution to our existing stockholders if we are unable to obtain debt or equity financing on reasonable terms we may be unable to execute our expansion strategy see “item 1a risk factors — our future success depends on our ability to build new manufacturing plants and add production lines in a costeffective manner both of which are subject risks and uncertainties” 

 

the recent and unprecedented disruption in the current credit markets has had a significant adverse impact on a number of financial institutions as of december 27 2008 our liquidity and investments have not been materially adversely impacted by the current credit environment and we believe that they will not be materially adversely impacted in the near future we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity and the credit markets however we cannot predict with any certainty the impact to us of any further disruption in the credit environment

our debtfinancing agreements bear interest based on the euro interbank offered rate euribor euribor is the primary interbank lending rate within the euro zone with maturities ranging from one week to one year a disruption of the credit environment as currently experienced could negatively impact interbank lending and therefore negatively impact the euribor rate an increase in the euribor rate would increase our cost of borrowing 

 

on december 30 2007 the beginning of our fiscal year 2008 we adopted sfas 157 our adoption of sfas 157 was limited to our financial assets and financial liabilities as permitted by fsp 1572 we do not have any nonfinancial assets or nonfinancial liabilities that we recognize or disclose at fair value in our financial statements on a recurring basis our adoption of sfas 157 did not have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations and our fair value models do not make material use of unobservable inputs see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for further information about our adoption of sfas 157

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

foreign currency exchange risk 

 

our international operations accounted for 95 of our net sales during 2008 and 988 of our net sales during 2007 all of these international sales were denominated in euro as a result we have exposure to foreign exchange risk with respect to almost all of our net sales fluctuations in exchange rates particularly in the us dollar to euro exchange rate affect our gross and net profit margins and could result in foreign exchange and operating losses in the past most of our exposure to foreign exchange risk has related to currency gains and losses between the times we sign and settle our sales contracts for example our long term supply contracts obligate us to deliver solar modules at a fixed price in euros per watt and do not adjust for fluctuations in the us dollar to euro exchange rate for the year ended december 27 2008 a 10 change in the euro exchange rates would have impacted our net euro sales by 1183 million with the expansion of our manufacturing operations into germany and the current expansion into malaysia many of our operating expenses for the plants in these countries will be denominated in the local currency 

 

our primary foreign currency exposures are transaction cash flow and translation 

 

transaction exposure we have certain assets and liabilities primarily receivables investments accounts payable including intercompany transactions and debt that are denominated in currencies other than the relevant entity’s functional currency in certain circumstances changes in the functional currency value of these assets and liabilities create fluctuations in our reported consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other instruments to minimize the effect of shortterm foreign currency fluctuations on these assets and liabilities the gains and losses on the foreign exchange forward contracts offset all or part of the transaction gains and losses that we recognize in earnings on these assets and liabilities 

 

as of december 27 2008 the total notional value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase euros with us dollars was €1752 million 2453 million at the balance sheet close rate on december 27 2008 of 140€100 the total notional value of foreign exchange contracts to sell euros for us dollars was €1230 million 

1722 million at the balance sheet close rate on december 27 2008 of 140€100 and the total notional value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase malaysian ringgit with us dollars was myr 1480 million 429 million at the balance sheet close rate on december 27 2008 of 029myr100 as of december 27 2008 the unrealized loss of these forward contracts was 08 million these foreign exchange forward contracts have maturities of 24 months or less these currency forward contracts hedge third party balance sheet exposure 

 

if the us dollar would have weakened by 10 the adverse impact on our income before income taxes related to our foreign exchange contracts to purchase and sell euro and malaysian ringgit would have been 73 million and 43 million respectively 

 

cash flow exposure we have forecasted future cash flows including revenues and expenses denominated in currencies other than the relevant entity’s functional currency our primary cash flow exposures include future customer collections and vendor payments changes in the relevant entity’s functional currency value will cause fluctuations in the cash flows we expect to receive when these cash flows are realized or settled we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other derivatives to hedge the value of a portion of these cash flows we account for these foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges we initially report the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently reclassify it into earnings when the hedged transaction is settled 

 

most of our german plant’s operating expenses are denominated in euros creating natural hedges against the currency risk in our net sales in addition we purchased forward contracts to hedge the exchange risk on forecasted cash flows denominated in euro as of december 27 2008 the total notional value of these forward contracts was €6251 million 8751 million at the balance sheet close rate on december 27 2008 of 140€100 

 

earnings translation exposure fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to consolidate financial statements of our foreign currency denominated subsidiaries we may decide to purchase forward exchange contracts or other instruments to offset this impact from currency fluctuations these contracts would be markedtomarket on a monthly basis and any unrealized gain or loss would be recorded in interest and other income net we do not hedge translation exposure at this time but may do so in the future 

 

in the past currency exchange rate fluctuations have had an impact on our business and results of operations for example currency exchange rate fluctuations negatively impacted our cash flows by 202 million during 2008 and positively impacted our cash flows by 71 million during 2007 although we cannot predict the impact of future currency exchange rate fluctuations on our business or results of operations we believe that we have increased risk associated with currency exchange rate fluctuations in the future 

 

interest rate risk 

 

we are exposed to interest rate risk because many of our customers depend on debt and equity financing to purchase and install a solar power system although the useful life of a solar electricity generation system is approximately 25 years endusers of our solar modules must pay the entire cost of the system at the time of installation as a result many of our customers rely on debt financing to fund their upfront capital expenditure an increase in interest rates could make it difficult for our endusers to secure the financing necessary to purchase and install a system this could lower demand for our solar modules and system development services and reduce our net sales in addition we believe that a significant percentage of our endusers install solar power systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt an increase in interest rates could lower an investor’s return on investment in a system or make alternative investments more attractive relative to solar power systems which in each case could cause these endusers to seek alternative investments that promise higher returns 

 

during 2006 we entered into a credit facility with a consortium of banks which bears interest at euribor plus 16 as of december 27 2008 we hedged our exposure to changes in euribor using interest rate swaps with a combined notional value of €391 million 547 million at the balance sheet close rate on december 27 2008 of 140€100 

during may of 2008 we entered into a credit facility with ikb natixis natixis labuan branch and ausfuhrkreditgesellschaft mbh which is denominated in euro the loans under fixedrate credit facility will bear interest on the outstanding unpaid principal balance at an annual rate of 454 the loans under the floatingrate credit facility will bear interest on the outstanding unpaid principal balance at euribor plus a margin of 055 

 

in addition we invest some of our cash in debt securities which exposes us to interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and provide liquidity on demand while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the market value of the investment to fluctuate for example if we hold a security that was issued with an interest rate fixed at the thenprevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises the market value of our investment will probably decline to minimize this risk we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities including money market funds government and nongovernment debt securities and certificates of deposit as of december 27 2008 our fixedincome investments earned a pretax yield of approximately 16 with a weighted average maturity of 61 months if interest rates were to instantaneously increase decrease by 100 basis points the market value of our total investment portfolio could decrease increase by approximately 09 million the direct risk to us associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and we do not believe that a 10 change in interest rates will have a significant impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows as of december 27 2008 all of our investments were in money market accounts federal and foreign agency debt and corporate debt securities 

 

commodity and component risk 

 

we are exposed to price risks for the raw materials components and energy costs used in the manufacture and transportation of our solar modules also some of our raw materials and components are sourced from a limited number of suppliers or a sole supplier we endeavor to qualify multiple suppliers a process which could take up to 12 months if successful but some suppliers are unique and it may not be feasible to qualify second source suppliers in some cases we also enter into long term supply contracts for raw materials and components but these arrangements are normally of shorter duration than the term of our long term supply contracts with our customers as a result we remain exposed to price changes in the raw materials and components used in our modules in addition a failure by a key supplier could disrupt our supply chain which could result in higher prices for our raw materials and components and even a disruption in our manufacturing process since our selling price under our long term supply contracts does not adjust in the event of price changes in our underlying raw materials or components and since our long term supply contracts require minimum deliveries of our products during their term we are unable to pass along changes in the cost of the raw materials and components for our products and may be in default of our delivery obligations if we experience a manufacturing disruption 

 

credit risk 

 

we have certain financial and derivative instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk these consist primarily of cash cash equivalents investments trade accounts receivable interest rate swap agreements and forward foreign exchange contracts we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counter parties to our financial and derivative instruments we place cash cash equivalents investments interest rate swap agreements and enter into derivative contracts with highquality financial institutions and limit the amount of credit risk from any one counterparty we continuously evaluate the credit standing of our counterparty financial institutions 

 

in addition we have certain restricted investments that are exposed to credit risk these consist primarily of restricted investments which are held by a subsidiary of a financial services company to fund our estimated future product collection and recycling costs as of december 27 2008 our restricted investments with this financial services company were 258 million in october 2008 we entered into credit default swaps cds against the parent company of this financial services company to protect our investment from a significant predefined credit event to our counter party under a cds a third party assumes for a fee a portion of the credit risk related to the investment the cds we entered into provides protection for losses in the event of a predefined credit event of the parent company of the financial services company up to 250 million these cds expire on march 20 2009 and june 20 2009 respectively

 item 9a   controls and procedures tableend  

  

we maintain “disclosure controls and procedures” as such term is defined in rule 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met additionally in designing disclosure controls and procedures our management was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures the design of any disclosure control and procedure also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 

 

based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level 

 

  

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate “internal control over financial reporting” as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 27 2008 based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 

 

based on the results of our evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 27 2008 

 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 27 2008 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears herein 

 

  

there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter ended december 27 2008 covered by this annual report on form 10k that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

 

  

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are 

resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within our company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

 item 1   business tableend  

we design and manufacture solar modules using a proprietary thin film semiconductor technology that has allowed us to reduce our average solar module manufacturing costs to among the lowest in the world in 2007 our average manufacturing costs were 123 per watt which we believe is significantly less than those of traditional crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers by continuing to expand production and improve our technology and manufacturing process we believe that we can further reduce our manufacturing costs per watt and improve our cost advantage over traditional crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers our objective is to become by 2010 the first solar module manufacturer to offer a solar electricity solution that can generate electricity on a nonsubsidized basis at a cost equal to the price of retail electricity in key markets in north america europe and asia 

 

we manufacture our solar modules on highthroughput production lines and perform all manufacturing steps ourselves in an automated proprietary continuous process our solar modules employ a thin layer of cadmium telluride semiconductor material to convert sunlight into electricity in less than three hours we transform a 2ft × 4ft 60cm × 120cm sheet of glass into a complete solar module using approximately 1 of the semiconductor material used by other manufacturers to produce crystalline silicon solar modules our manufacturing process eliminates the multiple supply chain operators and expensive and time consuming batch processing steps that are used to produce a crystalline silicon solar module 

 

we have longterm solar module supply contracts the “long term supply contracts” with twelve european project developers and system integrators that in the aggregate allow for approximately €45 billion 59 billion at an assumed exchange rate of 130€100 in sales from 2008 to 2012 for the sale of a total of 32gw of solar modules 

 

our customers develop own and operate solar power plants or sell turnkey solar power plants to endusers that include owners of land owners of agricultural buildings owners of commercial warehouses offices and industrial buildings public agencies municipal government authorities utility companies and financial investors that desire to own large scale solar power plant projects 

in order to satisfy our contractual requirements and address additional market demand we are expanding our manufacturing capacity with the construction of four plants — each with four production lines — at our malaysian manufacturing center in august 2006 we expanded our ohio plant from one to three production lines in april 2007 we started initial production at a four line manufacturing plant in germany which reached full capacity in the third quarter of 2007 also in april 2007 we began construction of plant one of our malaysian manufacturing center in the third and fourth quarters of 2007 we began construction of plants two and three respectively and in the first quarter of 2008 we began construction of plant four we expect plant one to reach its full capacity in the second half of 2008 plant two to reach its full capacity in the first half of 2009 and plants three and four to reach full capacity in the second half of 2009 after plant four of our malaysian manufacturing center reaches its full capacity we will have 23 production lines and an annual global manufacturing capacity of approximately 1012mw based on the fourth quarter of 2007 average run rate at our existing plants 

 

acquisition of turner renewable energy llc 

 

on november 30 2007 we completed the acquisition of turner renewable energy llc a privately held company which designed and deployed commercial solar projects for utilities in the united states starting in december 2007 we operate this wholly owned subsidiary under the name of first solar electric llc “first solar electric” we believe the acquisition of turner renewable energy llc will enable us to offer solar electricity solutions to utility companies in the united states that are seeking cost effective renewable energy solutions for the purpose of meeting renewable portfolio standard requirements the total consideration for the transaction was 343 million excluding exit and transaction costs of 07 million consisting of 280 million in common stock and 63 million in cash 

 

products 

 

solar modules 

 

each solar module is approximately 2ft × 4ft 60cm × 120cm and had an average rated power of approximately 64 watts for 2006 and approximately 70 watts for 2007 our solar module is a singlejunction polycrystalline thin film structure that employs cadmium telluride as the absorption layer and cadmium sulfide as the window layer cadmium telluride has absorption properties that are highly matched to the solar spectrum and has the potential to deliver competitive conversion efficiencies with approximately 1 of the semiconductor material used by traditional crystalline silicon solar modules our thin film technology also has relatively high energy performance in low light and high temperature environments compared to traditional crystalline silicon solar modules 

 

certifications 

 

we have participated or are currently participating in laboratory and field tests with the national renewable energy laboratory the arizona state university photovoltaic testing laboratory the fraunhofer institute for solar energy tÜv immissionsschutz und energiesysteme gmbh and the institute für solar energieversorgungstechnik currently we have approximately 10000 solar modules installed worldwide at test sites designed to collect data for field performance validation using data logging equipment we also monitor approximately 457000 solar modules representing approximately 30mw of installed photovoltaic systems in use by the endusers that have purchased systems using our solar modules the modules in these monitored systems represent approximately 19 of all solar modules shipped by us from 2002 through 2007 

 

we maintain all certifications required to sell solar modules in the markets we serve or expect to serve including ul 1703 iec 61646 safety class ii and ce 

 

solar module warranty 

 

we provide a limited warranty to the owner of our solar modules for five years following delivery for defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions we also warrant to the owner of our solar modules that solar modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 90 of their power output rating during the first 10 years following their installation and at least 80 of their power output 

rating during the following 15 years in resolving claims under both the defects and power output warranties we have the option of either repairing or replacing the covered solar module or under the power output warranty providing additional solar modules to remedy the power shortfall our warranties are automatically transferred from the original purchaser of our solar modules to a subsequent purchaser as of december 29 2007 our accrued warranty liability was 73 million 

 

collection and recycling program 

 

endusers can return their solar modules to us at any time for collection and recycling at no cost we prefund the estimated collection and recycling cost at the time of sale assuming for this purpose a minimum service life of approximately 20 years for our solar modules in addition to achieving substantial environmental benefits our solar module collection and recycling program may provide us the opportunity to resell or redistribute working modules or recover certain raw materials and components for reuse in our manufacturing process first solar has developed a recycling process for manufacturing scrap warranty returns and end of life modules that produces glass suitable for the use in production of new glass products and extracts metals that will be further processed by a third party supplier to produce semiconductor materials for reuse in our solar modules 

 

manufacturing 

 

manufacturing process 

 

we have integrated our manufacturing processes into a continuous integrated production line with the following three stages the “deposition” stage the “cell definition” stage and the “assembly and test” stage in the deposition stage panels of treated glass are robotically loaded onto the production line where they are cleaned heated and coated with a layer of cadmium sulfide followed by a layer of cadmium telluride using our proprietary vapor transport deposition technology after which the semiconductorcoated plates are cooled rapidly to increase strength in our cell definition stage we use a series of lasers to transform the large single semiconductorcoated plate into a series of lasers to transform the large single semiconductorcoated plate into a series of interconnected cells that deliver the desired current and voltage output our proprietary laser scribing technology is capable of accomplishing accurate and complex scribes at high speeds finally in the assembly and test stage we apply busbars laminate a rear glass cover sheet and termination wires seal the joint box and subject each solar module to a solar simulator and current leakage test the final assembly stage is the only stage in our production line that requires manual processing 

 

historically all of our solar modules were produced at our perrysburg ohio facility which has received both an iso 90012000 quality system certification and iso 140012004 environmental system certification in april 2007 we started initial production at a manufacturing facility in frankfurtoder germany which has received all applicable licenses and permits to operate in accordance with german law our german plant has received iso 90012000 quality system certification and we anticipate the german plant to attain an iso 140012004 environmental system certification in the third quarter of 2008 

 

manufacturing capacity expansion 

 

we plan to expand our manufacturing capacity to 23 production lines by the end of 2009 in august 2006 we qualified two additional production lines at our ohio plant increasing our annual manufacturing capacity then to approximately 75mw based on the fourth quarter of 2006 run rate in april 2007 we started initial production at our four line manufacturing plant in germany which reached full capacity in the third quarter of 2007 bringing our total capacity to 308 mw at the end of 2007 based on the fourth quarter of 2007 run rates at these plants in addition on january 24 2007 we entered into a land lease agreement for a manufacturing center site in the kulim hitech park in the state of kadah malaysia the malaysia site accommodates up to four plants each with four productions lines in april 2007 we began construction of plant one of our malaysian manufacturing center in the third and fourth quarters of 2007 we began construction of plants two and three respectively and in the first quarter of 2008 we began construction of plant four we expect plant one to reach its full capacity in the second half of 2008 plant two to reach its full capacity in the first half of 2009 and plants three and four to reach full capacity in the second 

half of 2009 after plant four of our malaysian manufacturing center reaches its full capacity planned for the second half of 2009 we will have 23 production lines and an annual global manufacturing capacity of 1012mw 

 

raw materials 

 

our manufacturing process uses approximately 20 types of raw materials and components to construct a complete solar module of these raw materials and components the following nine are critical to our manufacturing process tco coated front glass cadmium sulfide cadmium telluride photo resist laminate tempered back glass cord platecord plate cap lead wire ul and tÜv and solar connectors before we use these materials and components in our manufacturing process a supplier must undergo a qualification process that can last up to 12 months depending on the type of raw material or component although we continually evaluate new suppliers and currently are qualifying several new suppliers most of our critical materials or components are either sole sourced or supplied by a limited number of suppliers 

 

one critical raw material in our production process is cadmium telluride presently we purchase all of our cadmium telluride in compounded form from a limited number of suppliers we have a long term supply contract with one of our cadmium telluride suppliers which provides for quarterly price adjustments based on the cost of tellurium 

 

customers 

 

we have long term supply contracts with twelve principal customers for the sale of solar modules these customers include project developers system integrators and operators of renewable energy projects and are headquartered throughout the european union the long term supply contracts in the aggregate allow for approximately €45 billion 59 billion at an assumed exchange rate of 130€100 in sales from 2008 to 2012 for the sale of a total of 32gw of solar modules 

 

in 2007 our principal customers were blitzstrom gmbh colexon energy ag previously reinecke  pohl conergy ag gehrlicher umweltschonende energiesysteme gmbh juwi solar gmbh and phoenix solar ag during 2007 each of these six customers individually accounted for between 10 and 23 of our net sales all of our other customers individually accounted for less than 10 of our net sales in 2007 the loss of any of our major customers could have an adverse effect on our business as we expand our manufacturing capacity we anticipate developing additional customer relationships in other markets and regions which will reduce our customer and geographic concentration and dependence 

 

sales and marketing 

 

we launched the marketing and sale of our solar modules in germany in 2003 because germany has attractive feedin tariffs a high forecasted growth rate for renewable energy and market segments that we believe are well served by our product since 2003 our focus has been on gridconnected ground or large roof mounted solar power plants in germany and other european union countries with feedin tariff subsidies that enable solar power plant owners to earn a reasonable rate of return on their capital several of our principal customers were authorized in 2007 to sell our solar modules in the united states in markets that have rebates or other forms of subsidies in november 2007 we completed the acquisition of turner renewable energy llc and established a wholly owned subsidiary first solar electric for the purpose of developing solar electricity solutions for utility companies in the united states that are seeking cost effective renewable energy solutions for the purpose of meeting renewable portfolio standard requirements 

 

economic incentives 

 

government subsidies economic incentives and other support for solar electricity generation generally include feedin tariffs net metering programs renewable portfolio standards rebates tax incentives and low interest loans 

 

under a feedin tariff subsidy the government sets prices that regulated utilities are required to pay for renewable electricity generated by endusers the prices are set above market rates and may differ based on system size or application net metering programs enable endusers to sell excess solar electricity to their local utility in 

exchange for a credit against their utility bills the policies governing net metering vary by state and utility some utilities pay the enduser upfront while others credit the enduser’s bill under a renewable portfolio standard the government requires regulated utilities to supply a portion of their total electricity in the form of renewable electricity some programs further specify that a portion of the renewable energy quota must be from solar electricity while others provide no specific technology requirement for renewable electricity generation 

 

tax incentive programs exist in the united states at both the federal and state level and can take the form of investment tax credits accelerated depreciation and property tax exemptions at the united states federal level investment tax credits for business and residential solar systems have gone through several cycles of enactment and expiration since the 1980’s several state governments also facilitate low interest loans for photovoltaic systems either through direct lending credit enhancement or other programs 

 

regulations and policies relating to electricity pricing and interconnection also encourage distributive generation with photovoltaic systems photovoltaic systems generate most of their electricity during the afternoon hours when the demand for and cost of electricity is highest as a result electricity generated by photovoltaic systems mainly competes with expensive peak hour electricity rather than the less expensive average price of electricity modifications to the peak hour pricing policies of utilities such as to a flat rate would require photovoltaic systems to achieve lower prices in order to compete with the price of electricity in addition interconnection policies often enable the owner of a photovoltaic system to feed solar electricity into the power grid without interconnection costs or standby fees 

 

research development and engineering 

 

we continue to devote a substantial amount of resources to research and development with the objective of lowering the per watt price of solar electricity generated by photovoltaic systems using our solar modules to a level that competes on a nonsubsidized basis with the price of retail electricity in key markets in north america europe and asia by 2010 to reduce the per watt manufacturing cost of electricity generated by photovoltaic systems using our solar modules we focus our research and development on the following areas 

 

  

we typically qualify process and product improvements for full production at our ohio plant and then utilize our “copy smart” process to integrate them into our other production lines our scientists and engineers collaborate across all manufacturing plants to drive improvements we typically implement validate and qualify such improvements at the ohio plant before we deploy them to all of our production lines we believe that this systematic approach to research and development will provide continuous improvements and ensure uniform adoption across our production lines in addition our production lines are replicas of each other using our “copy smart” process and as a result a process or production improvement on one line can be rapidly validated on other production lines 

 

we maintain active collaborations with the national renewable energy laboratory a division of the us department of energy brookhaven national laboratory and several universities since 2004 we have 

invested in excess of 296 million into our research and development expenses and received 46 million of grant funding

our success depends in part on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technology and to conduct our business without infringing on the proprietary rights of others we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks and trade secrets as well as employee and third party confidentiality agreements to safeguard our intellectual property as of december 29 2007 we held 22 patents in the united states which will expire at various times between 2009 and 2023 and had 25 patent applications pending we also held 14 patents and had over 50 patent applications pending in foreign jurisdictions our patent applications and any future patent applications might not result in a patent being issued with the scope of the claims we seek or at all and any patents we may receive may be challenged invalidated or declared unenforceable we continually assess appropriate occasions for seeking patent protection for those aspects of our technology designs and methodologies and processes that we believe provide significant competitive advantages 

 

as of december 29 2007 we held two trademarks “first solar” and “first solar and design” in the united states we have also registered our “first solar and design” mark in china japan and the european union and we are seeking registration in india and other countries 

 

with respect to proprietary knowhow that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce we rely on among other things trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests we believe that many elements of our photovoltaic manufacturing process involve proprietary knowhow technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications including technical processes equipment designs algorithms and procedures we have taken security measures to protect these elements all of our research and development personnel have entered into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us these agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our associates to assign to us all of the inventions designs and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us we also require our customers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our solar cells technology or business plans 

 

we have not been subject to any material intellectual property claims 

 

competition 

 

the solar energy and renewable energy industries are both highly competitive and continually evolving as participants strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete within the larger electric power industry within the renewable energy industry we compete with other renewable energy technologies including hydro wind geothermal biomass and tidal within the solar energy industry we believe that our main sources of competition are crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers other thin film solar module manufacturers and companies developing solar thermal and concentrated photovoltaic technologies among photovoltaic module and cell manufacturers the principal methods of competition are price per watt production capacity conversion efficiency and reliability we believe that we compete favorably with respect to all of these factors 

 

at the end of 2007 the global photovoltaic industry consisted of more than 100 manufacturers of solar cells and modules within the photovoltaic industry we face competition from numerous crystalline silicon solar cell and module manufacturers we also face competition from thin film solar module manufacturers 

 

in addition we expect to compete with future entrants to the photovoltaic industry that offer new technological solutions we may also face competition from semiconductor manufacturers and semiconductor equipment manufacturers or their customers several of which have already announced their intention to start production of photovoltaic cells solar modules or turnkey production lines some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources larger production capacities and greater brand name recognition than we do and may as a result be better positioned to adapt to changes in the industry or the economy as a whole 

we also face competition from companies that are developing various solar thermal solutions for utility scale power plant applications in addition to manufacturers of solar photovoltaic equipment we face competition from companies developing concentrating photovoltaic systems and other renewable energy technologies 

 

as we develop our business under first solar electric and begin to offer solar electricity solutions to utilities we expect to face competition from other providers of renewable energy solutions including developers of photovoltaic solar thermal and concentrated solar power plants as well as developers of alternate forms of renewable energy projects 

 

environmental matters 

 

our manufacturing operations include the use handling storage transportation generation and disposal of hazardous materials we are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the use management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes occupational health and safety and the cleanup of contaminated sites therefore we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions and costs arising from third party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws or noncompliance with environmental permits required at our facilities we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and do not expect to incur material capital expenditures for environmental controls in the foreseeable future however future developments such as more aggressive enforcement policies the implementation of new more stringent laws and regulations or the discovery of unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations andor financial condition see “item 1a risk factors — environmental obligations and liabilities could have a substantial negative impact on our financial condition cash flows and profitability” 

 

associates 

 

as of december 29 2007 we had 1462 associates our term for employees including 1187 in manufacturing the remainder of our associates are in research and development sales and marketing and general and administration positions none of our associates are represented by labor unions or covered by a collective bargaining agreement as we expand domestically and internationally however we may encounter associates who desire union representation we believe that our relations with our associates are good we expect our headcount to double by the end of fiscal 2008 given our continued growth and expansion in malaysia 

 

information about geographic areas 

 

we have significant marketing and distribution operations outside the united states and with the completion of our german plant and construction of our malaysian manufacturing center we expect to have significant manufacturing operations outside the united states in 2007 988 of our net sales were generated from customers headquartered in the european union in the future we expect to expand our operations in other european countries beyond germany malaysia and other asian countries and as a result we will be subject to the legal political social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions the international nature of our operations subject us to a number of risks including fluctuations in exchange rates adverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements and tariffs taxes and other trade restrictions see “item 1a risk factors — our substantial international operations subject us to a number of risks including unfavorable political regulatory labor and tax conditions in foreign countries” see also note 22 “segment and geographical information” to our consolidated financial statements referenced in item 15 of this annual report on form 10k for information about our net sales by geographic region for the years ended december 29 2007 december 30 2006 and december 31 2005 and see our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7 of this annual report on form 10k for other information about our operations and activities in various geographic regions

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

an investment in our stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the following information together with the other information in this annual report on form 10k before buying shares of our stock if any of the following risks or uncertainties occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected the trading price of our stock could decline and you may lose all or a part of the money you paid to buy our stock 

 

our limited operating history may not serve as an adequate basis to judge our future prospects and results of operations 

 

we have a limited operating history although we began developing our predecessor technology in 1987 we did not launch commercial operations until we qualified our pilot production line in january 2002 we qualified the first production line at our ohio plant in november 2004 the second and third production lines at our ohio plant in august 2006 and our german plant in the third quarter of 2007 because these production lines have only been in operation for a limited period of time our historical operating results may not provide a meaningful basis for evaluating our business financial performance and prospects while our net sales grew from 481 million in 2005 to 5040 million in 2007 we may be unable to achieve similar growth or grow at all in future periods accordingly you should not rely on our results of operations for any prior period as an indication of our future performance 

 

thin film technology has a short history and our thin film technology and solar modules may perform below expectations 

 

researchers began developing thin film semiconductor technology over 20 years ago but were unable to integrate the technology into a solar module production line until recently our oldest active production line has only been in operation since november 2004 and the oldest solar modules manufactured during the qualification of our pilot line have only been in use since 2001 as a result our thin film technology and solar modules do not have a sufficient operating history to confirm how our solar modules will perform over their estimated 25year useful life we perform a variety of quality and life tests under different conditions however if our thin film technology and solar modules perform below expectations we could lose customers and face substantial warranty expense 

 

our failure to further refine our technology and develop and introduce improved photovoltaic products could render our solar modules uncompetitive or obsolete and reduce our net sales and market share 

 

we will need to invest significant financial resources in research and development to keep pace with technological advances in the solar energy industry however research and development activities are inherently uncertain and we could encounter practical difficulties in commercializing our research results our significant expenditures on research and development may not produce corresponding benefits other companies are developing a variety of competing photovoltaic technologies including copper indium gallium diselenide and amorphous silicon which could produce solar modules that prove more costeffective or have better performance than 

our solar modules as a result our solar modules may be rendered obsolete by the technological advances of our competitors which could reduce our net sales and market share 

 

if photovoltaic technology is not suitable for widespread adoption or if sufficient demand for solar modules does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate our net sales may flatten or decline and we may be unable to sustain profitability 

 

the solar energy market is at a relatively early stage of development and the extent to which solar modules will be widely adopted is uncertain if photovoltaic technology proves unsuitable for widespread adoption or if demand for solar modules fails to develop sufficiently we may be unable to grow our business or generate sufficient net sales to sustain profitability in addition demand for solar modules in our targeted markets — including germany spain france italy and the united states — may not develop or may develop to a lesser extent than we anticipate many factors may affect the viability of widespread adoption of photovoltaic technology and demand for solar modules including the following 

 

  

our future success depends on our ability to build new manufacturing plants and add production lines in a costeffective manner both of which are subject to risks and uncertainties 

 

our future success depends on our ability to significantly increase both our manufacturing capacity and production throughput in a costeffective and efficient manner if we cannot do so we may be unable to expand our business decrease our cost per watt maintain our competitive position satisfy our contractual obligations or sustain profitability our ability to expand production capacity is subject to significant risks and uncertainties including the following 

 

 12 

 

if our future production lines are not built in line with our committed schedules or do not achieve operating metrics similar to our existing production lines our solar modules could perform below expectations and cause us to lose customers 

 

currently the production lines at our ohio and german plants are our only production lines that have a history of operating at full capacity future production lines could produce solar modules that have lower efficiencies higher failure rates and higher rates of degradation than solar modules from our existing production lines and we could be unable to determine the cause of the lower operating metrics or develop and implement solutions to improve performance the second and third production lines at our ohio plant completed in august 2006 represent a “standard building block” that we replicated twice to build the four production lines at our german plant we are using the same systematic replication process to build our malaysian manufacturing center and future production facilities including expansion of our existing production facilities our replication risk in connection with building production lines at our malaysian manufacturing center and other future manufacturing plants could be higher than our replication risk was in expanding the ohio plant because these new production lines are located internationally which could entail other factors that will lower their operating metrics if we are unable to systematically replicate our production lines to meet our committed schedules and achieve and sustain similar operating metrics in our malaysian manufacturing center and future production lines as our existing production lines our manufacturing capacity could be substantially constrained our manufacturing costs per watt could increase and we could lose customers causing lower net sales higher liabilities and lower net income than we anticipate in addition we might be unable to produce enough solar modules to satisfy our contractual requirements under our long term customer contracts 

 

some of our manufacturing equipment is customized and sole sourced if our manufacturing equipment fails or if our equipment suppliers fail to perform under their contracts we could experience production disruptions and be unable to satisfy our contractual requirements 

 

some of our manufacturing equipment is customized to our production lines based on designs or specifications that we provide the equipment manufacturer who then undertakes a specialized process to manufacture the custom equipment as a result the equipment is not readily available from multiple vendors and would be difficult to repair or replace if it were to become damaged or stop working if any piece of equipment fails production along the entire production line could be interrupted and we could be unable to produce enough solar modules to satisfy our contractual requirements under our long term customer contracts in addition the failure of our equipment suppliers to supply equipment in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms could delay our expansion plans and otherwise disrupt our production schedule or increase our manufacturing costs all of which would adversely impact our financial results 

 

we may be unable to manage the expansion of our operations effectively 

 

we expect to expand our business significantly in order to meet our contractual obligations satisfy demand for our solar modules and increase market share in august 2006 we expanded our ohio plant from one to three production lines in april 2007 we started initial production at our four line manufacturing plant in germany which reached full capacity in the third quarter of 2007 also in april 2007 we began construction of plant one of our malaysian manufacturing center in the third and fourth quarters of 2007 we began construction of plants two and three respectively and in the first quarter of 2008 we began construction of plant four following the completion of plant four of our malaysian manufacturing center we will have grown from one production line to 23 production lines with an annual global manufacturing capacity of approximately 1012mw in four years based on the fourth quarter of 2007 run rate at our existing plants 

 

to manage the rapid expansion of our operations we will be required to improve our operational and financial systems procedures and controls and expand train and manage our growing associate base our management will also be required to maintain and expand our relationships with customers suppliers and other third parties and attract new customers and suppliers in addition our current and planned operations personnel systems and internal procedures and controls might be inadequate to support our future growth if we cannot manage our growth effectively we may be unable to take advantage of market opportunities execute our business strategies or respond to competitive pressures 

we depend on a limited number of suppliers for key raw materials and components and their failure to perform could cause manufacturing delays and impair our ability to deliver solar modules to customers in the required quality and quantities and at a price that is profitable to us 

 

our failure to obtain raw materials and components that meet our quality quantity and cost requirements in a timely manner could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture our solar modules or increase our manufacturing cost most of our key raw materials and components are either solesourced or sourced by a limited number of thirdparty suppliers as a result the failure of any of our suppliers to perform could disrupt our supply chain and impair our operations in addition many of our suppliers are small companies that may be unable to supply our increasing demand for raw materials and components as we implement our planned rapid expansion we may be unable to identify new suppliers or qualify their products for use on our production lines in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms raw materials and components from new suppliers may also be less suited for our technology and yield solar modules with lower conversion efficiencies higher failure rates and higher rates of degradation than solar modules manufactured with the raw materials from our current suppliers a constraint on our production may cause us to be unable to meet our obligations under our long term customer contracts which would have an adverse impact on our financial results 

 

a disruption in our supply chain for cadmium telluride our semiconductor material could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture solar modules 

 

the key raw material we use in our production process is a cadmium telluride compound with the tellurium component of the compound being the most critical currently we purchase most of our cadmium telluride in manufactured form from a limited number of suppliers if our current suppliers or any of our future suppliers are unable to perform under their contracts or purchase orders our operations could be interrupted or impaired in addition because our suppliers must undergo a lengthy qualification process we may be unable to replace a lost supplier in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms our supply of cadmium telluride could also be limited if any of our current suppliers or any of our future suppliers is unable to acquire an adequate supply of tellurium in a timely manner or at commercially reasonable prices if our competitors begin to use or increase their demand for cadmium telluride supply could be reduced and prices could increase if our current suppliers or any of our future suppliers cannot obtain sufficient tellurium it could substantially increase prices or be unable to perform under their contracts we may be unable to pass increases in the cost of our raw materials through to our customers because our customer contracts do not adjust for raw material price increases and are generally for a longer term than our raw material supply contracts a reduction in our production could result in our inability to meet our commitments under our long term customer contracts all of which would have an adverse impact on our financial results 

 

we currently depend on a limited number of customers with six customers accounting for substantially all of our net sales in 2007 the loss of or a significant reduction in orders from any of these customers could significantly reduce our net sales and negatively impact our operating results 

 

we currently sell substantially all of our solar modules to customers headquartered throughout the european union during 2007 our six largest customers each accounted for between 10 and 23 of our net sales the loss of any of our large customers their inability to perform under their contracts or their default in payment could significantly reduce our net sales and adversely impact our operating results in addition our long term supply contracts extend through 2012 and we expect them to allocate a significant amount of our production capacity to a limited number of customers as a result we do not expect to have a significant amount of excess production capacity to identify and then build relationships with new customers that could replace any lost customers and we will have to rely on future expansions to attract and service new customers in addition our customer relationships have been developed over a relatively short period of time and we cannot guarantee that we will have good relations with our customers in the future several of our competitors have more established relationships with our customers and may gain a larger share of our customers’ business over time 

if we are unable to further increase the number of sellable watts per solar module and reduce our manufacturing cost per watt we will be in default under certain of our long term supply contracts and our profitability could decline 

 

our long term supply contracts require either an increase in the minimum average number of watts per module of approximately 5 annually from 2008 to 2009 and then by 3 in 2012 or a base number of watts per module that increases 34 annually from 2008 to 20102011 and then remains fixed through 2012 our failure to achieve these metrics could reduce our profitability or allow some of our customers to terminate their contracts in addition all of our long term supply contracts specify a sales price per watt that declines by approximately 65 at the beginning of each year through the expiration date of each contract in 2012 our profitability could decline if we are unable to reduce our manufacturing cost per watt by at least the same rate at which our contractual prices decrease furthermore our failure to reduce cost per watt by increasing our efficiency may impair our ability to enter new markets that we believe will require lower cost per watt for us to be competitive and may impair our growth plans 

 

reduced growth in or the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives and other support for ongrid solar electricity applications could reduce demand for our solar modules lead to a reduction in our net sales and adversely impact our operating results 

 

reduced growth in or the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies economic incentives and other support for ongrid solar electricity may result in the diminished competitiveness of solar energy relative to conventional and nonsolar renewable sources of energy and could materially and adversely affect the growth of the solar energy industry and our net sales we believe that the nearterm growth of the market for ongrid applications where solar energy is used to supplement the electricity a consumer purchases from the utility network depends significantly on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives currently the cost of solar electricity substantially exceeds the retail price of electricity in every significant market in the world as a result federal state and local governmental bodies in many countries most notably germany italy spain france greece portugal south korea japan canada and the united states have provided subsidies in the form of feedin tariffs rebates tax incentives and other incentives to endusers distributors systems integrators and manufacturers of photovoltaic products for example germany which accounted for 907 of our net sales in 2007 has been a strong supporter of photovoltaic products and systems and political changes in germany could result in significant reductions in or the elimination of incentives many of these government incentives expire phase out over time exhaust the allocated funding or require renewal by the applicable authority for example german subsidies decline at a rate of 50 or 65 per year based on the type of the photovoltaic system and discussions are ongoing about modifying the german renewable energy law or the eeg the government proposal for the eeg amendment published on december 5 2007 provides a one time adjustment of one euro cent per kwh starting on january 1 2009 plus a gradual increase of degression rates for roof systems from currently 5 to 7 starting 2009 and to 8 starting 2011 and for ground mounted systems from currently 65 to 7 starting 2009 and to 8 starting 2011 it also recommends the introduction of a new tariff group for roof systems greater than 1000 kwp with a feedin tariff of 3448 euro cents per kwh in 2009 if the german government reduces or eliminates the subsidies under the eeg demand for photovoltaic products could significantly decline in germany 

 

in spain which accounted for approximately 1 of our net sales the spanish royal decree currently supports system installations registered before september 27 2008 proposals for a followup regulation are under discussion however a final conclusion is not expected before march of 2008 if the spanish government does not release a new decree before september 27 2008 there will be no feedin tariff for new pv systems installed connected or registered after that date 

 

in the united states california has been the state where the majority of solar installations have taken place during the past five years starting january 1 2007 the california solar initiative csi has established a goal of installing 3000mw of solar generated electricity by 2017 with a state budget of 33 billion over 10 years the csi is structured to reduce the incentives paid to solar system owners as the cumulative volume of solar installations reaches predetermined threshold limits for example the buydown incentives and performance based incentives are planned to be reduced by approximately 50 between a cumulative installed solar capacity of 100mw and 

200mw potentially reducing demand for solar unless system cost reductions can be achieved emerging subsidy programs such as the programs in italy france greece south korea and ontario canada may require an extended period of time to attain effectiveness because the applicable permitting and grid connection processes associated with these programs can be lengthy and administratively burdensome 

 

in addition if any of these statutes or regulations is found to be unconstitutional or is reduced or discontinued for other reasons sales of our solar modules in these countries could decline significantly which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations for example the predecessor to the german eeg was challenged in germany on constitutional grounds and in the european court of justice as impermissible state aid although the german federal high court of justice dismissed these constitutional concerns and the european court of justice held that the purchase requirement at minimum feedin tariffs did not constitute impermissible state aid new proceedings challenging the renewable energies act or comparable minimum price regulations in other countries in which we currently operate or intend to operate may be initiated 

 

electric utility companies or generators of electricity from fossil fuels or other renewable energy sources could also lobby for a change in the relevant legislation in their markets to protect their revenue streams reduced growth in or the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar energy applications especially those in our target markets could cause our net sales to decline and materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

in the united states the 30 business and residential investment tax credit for solar energy systems reverts back to 10 at the end of 2008 unless it is extended the united states congress attempted to extend the 30 investment tax credit during 2007 but was unsuccessful if the 30 investment tax credit is not extended or not extended by midyear 2008 or is only extended for a limited period of time demand for solar energy systems in the united states at prices that are profitable could decline 

 

we face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules thin film solar modules and solar thermal and concentrated photovoltaic systems 

 

the solar energy and renewable energy industries are both highly competitive and continually evolving as participants strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete with the larger electric power industry we believe that our main sources of competition are crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers other thin film solar module manufacturers and companies developing solar thermal and concentrated photovoltaic technologies 

 

at the end of 2007 the global photovoltaic industry consisted of over 100 manufacturers of solar cells and modules within the photovoltaic industry we face competition from crystalline silicon solar cell and module manufacturers we also face competition from established thin film solar module manufacturers and several crystalline silicon manufacturers who are developing thin film technologies we also face competition from semiconductor manufacturers and semiconductor equipment manufacturers and numerous startup companies that have attracted significant funding during 2007 — or their customers several of which have begun or have already announced their intention to start production of photovoltaic cells solar modules or turnkey production lines in addition to manufacturers of solar cells and modules we face competition from companies developing solar thermal and concentrated photovoltaic technologies 

 

even if demand for solar modules continues to grow the rapid expansion plans of many solar cell and module manufacturers could create periods where supply exceeds demand during any such period our competitors could decide to reduce their sales price even below their manufacturing cost in order to generate sales as a result we may be unable to sell our solar modules at attractive prices or for a profit during any period of excess supply of solar modules which would reduce our net sales and harm our results of operations 

 

many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial technical manufacturing and other resources than we do a competitor’s greater size provides them with a competitive advantage because they often can realize economies of scale and purchase certain raw materials at lower prices many of our competitors also have greater brand name recognition more established distribution networks and larger customer bases in addition many of our competitors have wellestablished relationships with our current and potential 

distributors and have extensive knowledge of our target markets as a result of their greater size some of our competitors may be able to devote more resources to the research development promotion and sale of their products or respond more quickly to evolving industry standards and changes in market conditions than we can in addition a significant increase in the supply of silicon feedstock or a significant reduction in the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules could lead to pricing pressures for solar modules our failure to adapt to changing market conditions and to compete successfully with existing or new competitors may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 

our substantial international operations subject us to a number of risks including unfavorable political regulatory labor and tax conditions in foreign countries 

 

we have significant marketing and distribution operations outside the united states and with the completion of our german plant and construction of our malaysian manufacturing center we expect to have significant manufacturing operations outside the united states in 2007 988 of our net sales were generated from customers headquartered in the european union in the future we expect to expand our operations in other european countries beyond germany malaysia and other asian countries and as a result we will be subject to the legal political social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions risks inherent to international operations include but are not limited to the following 

 

  

our business in foreign markets requires us to respond to rapid changes in market conditions in these countries our overall success as a global business depends in part on our ability to succeed in differing legal regulatory economic social and political conditions we may not be able to develop and implement policies and strategies that will be effective in each location where we do business in addition each of the foregoing risks is likely to take on increased significance as we implement our plans to expand our foreign manufacturing operations 

 

problems with product quality or performance may cause us to incur warranty expenses damage our market reputation and prevent us from maintaining or increasing our market share 

 

our solar modules are sold with a five year materials and workmanship warranty for technical defects and a twentyfive year warranty against declines of more than 10 of their initial rated power in the first 10 years following their installation and 20 of initial rated power in the following 15 years respectively as a result we bear the risk of extensive warranty claims long after we have sold our solar modules and recognized net sales as of december 29 2007 our accrued warranty liability was 73 million 

while our power output warranty extends for twentyfive years our oldest solar modules manufactured during the qualification of our pilot production line have only been in use since 2001 because of the limited operating history of our solar modules we have been required to make assumptions regarding the durability and reliability of our solar modules our assumptions could prove to be materially different from the actual performance of our solar modules causing us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective solar modules in the future for example our glassonglass solar modules could break delaminate or experience power degradation in excess of expectations in addition once our solar modules are installed connected and exposed to sunlight but before they are connected to a power grid or there is a load otherwise put on them they are in an open circuit condition we are continuing to collect data on the longterm effects on reliability and service life that results from extended periods of the solar modules being in an open circuit condition particularly in high ambient temperature conditions although the data available to us to date does not suggest significant deterioration in longterm performance of solar modules that are left in a prolonged open circuit condition it may become apparent with future experience that the longterm performance and service life of our solar modules is affected by remaining in an open circuit condition for prolonged periods of time any widespread product failures may damage our market reputation and cause our sales to decline and require us to repair or replace the defective modules which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

 

if our estimates regarding the future cost of collecting and recycling our solar modules are incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses at and from the time we realize our estimates are incorrect and face a significant unplanned cash burden when our endusers return their solar modules 

 

we prefund our estimated future obligation for collecting and recycling our solar modules based on the present value of the expected future cost of the collecting and recycling process this cost includes the cost of packaging the solar module for transport the cost of freight from the solar module’s installation site to a recycling center and the material labor and capital costs of the recycling process the related expense that we recognize in our financial statements also includes an estimated thirdparty profit margin and risk rate for such services currently we base our estimates on our experience collecting and recycling solar modules that do not pass our quality control tests and solar modules returned under our warranty and on our expectations about future developments in recycling technologies and processes and about economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled if our estimates prove incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses at and from the time we realize our estimates are incorrect and also face a significant unplanned cash burden at the time we realize our estimates are incorrect or endusers return their solar modules which could harm our operating results in addition our endusers can return their solar modules at any time as a result we could be required to collect and recycle our solar modules earlier than we expect and before recycling technologies and processes improve 

 

our future success depends on our ability to retain our key associates and to successfully integrate them into our management team 

 

we are dependent on the services of michael j ahearn our chief executive officer bruce sohn our president jens meyerhoff our chief financial officer ken schultz our executive vice president global marketing and business development john t gaffney our executive vice president and general counsel and other members of our senior management team the loss of messrs ahearn sohn meyerhoff schultz gaffney or any other member of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on us there is a risk that we will not be able to retain or replace these key associates several of our current key associates including messrs ahearn sohn meyerhoff schultz and gaffney are subject to employment conditions or arrangements that contain postemployment noncompetition provisions however these arrangements permit the associates to terminate their employment with us upon little or no notice 

 

if we are unable to attract train and retain key personnel our business may be materially and adversely affected 

 

our future success depends to a significant extent on our ability to attract train and retain management operations and technical personnel recruiting and retaining capable personnel particularly those with expertise in the photovoltaic industry thin film technology and cadmium telluride are vital to our success there is substantial 

competition for qualified technical personnel and we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain our technical personnel in addition a significant percentage of our current management operations and technical personnel have stock options that vest in 2008 and it may be more difficult to retain these individuals after their options vest if we are unable to attract and retain qualified associates our business may be materially and adversely affected 

 

our failure to protect our intellectual property rights may undermine our competitive position and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against thirdparty allegations of infringement may be costly 

 

protection of our proprietary processes methods and other technology especially our proprietary vapor transport deposition process and laser scribing process is critical to our business failure to protect and monitor the use of our existing intellectual property rights could result in the loss of valuable technologies we rely primarily on patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights and other contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property as of december 29 2007 we held 22 patents in the united states and 14 patents in select foreign jurisdictions a majority of our patents expire at various times between 2009 and 2023 our existing patents and future patents could be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable we have pending patent applications in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents or if patents are issued to us such patents may not be sufficient to provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies 

 

we also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our associates and third parties to protect our intellectual property such confidentiality agreements are limited in duration and could be breached and may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary manufacturing expertise adequate remedies may not be available in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise in addition others may obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or legal means the failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes equipment technology trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise methods and compounds could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries especially any developing countries into which we may expand our operations in some countries we have not applied for patent trademark or copyright protection 

 

third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary technologies or other intellectual property rights which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology can be difficult and expensive also litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others we cannot assure you that the outcome of such potential litigation will be in our favor such litigation may be costly and may divert management attention and other resources away from our business an adverse determination in any such litigation will impair our intellectual property rights and may harm our business prospects and reputation in addition we have no insurance coverage against litigation costs and would have to bear all costs arising from such litigation to the extent we are unable to recover them from other parties 

 

we may be exposed to infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties which if determined adversely to us could cause us to pay significant damage awards or prohibit us from the manufacture and sale of our solar modules or the use of our technology 

 

our success depends largely on our ability to use and develop our technology and knowhow without infringing or misappropriating the intellectual property rights of third parties the validity and scope of claims relating to photovoltaic technology patents involve complex scientific legal and factual considerations and analysis and therefore may be highly uncertain we may be subject to litigation involving claims of patent infringement or violation of intellectual property rights of third parties the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits patent opposition proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings can be both costly and time consuming and may significantly divert the efforts and resources of our technical and management personnel an 

adverse determination in any such litigation or proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liability to third parties require us to seek licenses from third parties which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all or pay ongoing royalties require us to redesign our solar module or subject us to injunctions prohibiting the manufacture and sale of our solar modules or the use of our technologies protracted litigation could also result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of our solar modules until the resolution of such litigation 

 

currency translation and transaction risk may negatively affect our net sales cost of sales and gross margins and could result in exchange losses 

 

although our reporting currency is the us dollar we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most countries in which we operate as a result we are subject to currency translation and transaction risk for example 950 and 988 of our net sales were outside the united states and denominated in euros for the fiscal year ended december 30 2006 and december 29 2007 respectively and we expect a large percentage of our net sales to be outside the united states and denominated in foreign currencies in the future in addition with the expansion of our manufacturing operations into germany and our current expansion into malaysia our operating expenses for the plants in these countries will be denominated in the local currency changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar could affect our net sales and cost of sales and could result in exchange gains or losses for example the strengthening euro contributed 438 million to our net sales during fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 in addition we incur currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from our reporting currency for example our long term supply contracts specify fixed pricing in euros through 2012 and do not adjust for changes in the us dollar to euro exchange rate we cannot accurately predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations 

 

we could also expand our business into emerging markets many of which have an uncertain regulatory environment relating to currency policy conducting business in such emerging markets could cause our exposure to changes in exchange rates to increase 

 

an increase in interest rates or tightening of the supply of capital by global financial markets could make it difficult for endusers to finance the cost of a photovoltaic system and could reduce the demand for our solar modules 

 

many of our endusers depend on debt financing to fund the initial capital expenditure required to purchase and install a photovoltaic system as a result an increase in interest rates could make it difficult for our endusers to secure the financing necessary to purchase and install a photovoltaic system on favorable terms or at all and thus lower demand for our solar modules and reduce our net sales in addition we believe that a significant percentage of our endusers install photovoltaic systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt an increase in interest rates could lower an investor’s return on investment in a photovoltaic system or make alternative investments more attractive relative to photovoltaic systems and in each case could cause these endusers to seek alternative investments a reduction in the supply of nonrecourse project debt financing or tax equity investments could reduce the number of solar projects that receive financing and thus lower demand for solar modules 

 

existing regulations and policies and changes to these regulations and policies may present technical regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of photovoltaic products which may significantly reduce demand for our solar modules 

 

the market for electricity generation products is heavily influenced by foreign federal state and local government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry as well as policies promulgated by electric utilities these regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customerowned electricity generation in the united states and in a number of other countries these regulations and policies have been modified in the past and may be modified again in the future these regulations and policies could deter enduser purchases of photovoltaic products and investment in the research and development of photovoltaic technology for example without a mandated regulatory exception for photovoltaic systems utility 

customers are often charged interconnection or standby fees for putting distributed power generation on the electric utility grid these fees could increase the cost to our endusers of using photovoltaic systems and make them less desirable thereby harming our business prospects results of operations and financial condition in addition electricity generated by photovoltaic systems mostly competes with expensive peak hour electricity rather than the less expensive average price of electricity modifications to the peak hour pricing policies of utilities such as to a flat rate would require photovoltaic systems to achieve lower prices in order to compete with the price of electricity 

 

we anticipate that our solar modules and their installation will be subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with national and local ordinances relating to building codes safety environmental protection utility interconnection and metering and related matters it is difficult to track the requirements of individual states and design equipment to comply with the varying standards any new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to our solar modules may result in significant additional expenses to us our resellers and their customers and as a result could cause a significant reduction in demand for our solar modules 

 

environmental obligations and liabilities could have a substantial negative impact on our financial condition cash flows and profitability 

 

our operations involve the use handling generation processing storage transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations at the national state local and international level these environmental laws and regulations include those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the use management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites and occupational health and safety we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs and capital expenditures in complying with these laws and regulations in addition violations of or liabilities under environmental laws or permits may result in restrictions being imposed on our operating activities or in our being subjected to substantial fines penalties criminal proceedings third party property damage or personal injury claims cleanup costs or other costs while we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements future developments such as more aggressive enforcement policies the implementation of new more stringent laws and regulations or the discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

in addition our products contain cadmium telluride and cadmium sulfide elemental cadmium and certain of its compounds are regulated as hazardous due to the adverse health effects that may arise from human exposure although the risks of exposure to cadmium telluride are not believed to be as serious as those relating to exposure to elemental cadmium the chemical physical and toxicological properties of cadmium telluride have not been thoroughly investigated and reported we maintain engineering controls to minimize associate exposure to cadmium and require our associates who handle cadmium compounds to follow certain safety procedures including the use of personal protective equipment such as respirators chemical goggles and protective clothing in addition we believe the risk of exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds from our endproducts is limited by the fully encapsulated nature of these materials in our products as well as the implementation in 2005 of our end of life collection and recycling program for our solar modules while we believe that these factors and procedures are sufficient to protect our associates endusers and the general public from cadmium exposure we cannot assure you that human or environmental exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds used in our products will not occur any such exposure could result in future thirdparty claims against us as well as damage to our reputation and heightened regulatory scrutiny of our products which could limit or impair our ability to sell and distribute our products the occurrence of future events such as these could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

the use of cadmium in various products is also coming under increasingly stringent governmental regulation future regulation in this area could impact the manufacture sale collection and recycling of cadmiumcontaining solar modules and could require us to make unforeseen environmental expenditures or limit our ability to sell and distribute our products for example the european union directive 200296ec on waste electrical and electronic equipment or the “weee directive” requires manufacturers of certain electrical and electronic equipment to be financially responsible for the collection recycling treatment and disposal of specified products sold in the european union in addition european union directive 200295ec on the restriction of the use of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment or the “rohs directive” restricts the use of certain hazardous substances including cadmium in specified products other jurisdictions are considering adopting similar 

legislation currently photovoltaic solar modules in general are not subject to the weee or rohs directives however these directives allow for future amendments subjecting additional products to their requirements and the scope applicability and the products included in the weee and rohs directives are currently being considered and may change if in the future our solar modules become subject to requirements such as these we may be required to apply for an exemption if we were unable to obtain an exemption we would be required to redesign our solar modules in order to continue to offer them for sale within the european union which would be impractical failure to comply with these directives could result in the imposition of fines and penalties the inability to sell our solar modules in the european union competitive disadvantages and loss of net sales all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the estate of john t walton and its affiliates have significant control over us and their interests may conflict with or differ from your interests as a stockholder 

 

our current majority stockholder the estate of john t walton and its affiliates including jcl holdings llc beneficially own approximately 459 of our outstanding common stock as a result the estate of john t walton and its affiliates have substantial influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of our directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions such as mergers tender offers and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets in addition our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that unless and until the estate of john t walton jcl holdings llc john t walton’s surviving spouse descendants any entity including a trust that is for the benefit of john t walton’s surviving spouse or descendants or any entity including a trust over which any of john t walton’s surviving spouse descendants or siblings has voting or dispositive power collectively the “estate” collectively owns less than 40 of our common stock then outstanding stockholders holding 40 or more of our common stock then outstanding may call a special meeting of the stockholders at which our stockholders could replace our board of directors in addition unless and until the estate collectively owns less than 40 of our common stock then outstanding stockholder action may be taken by written consent the interests of the estate could conflict with or differ from your interests as a holder of our common stock for example the concentration of ownership held by the estate could delay defer or prevent a change of control of our company or impede a merger takeover or other business combination which you may view favorably 

 

we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions and integration of these acquisitions may disrupt our business and management 

 

in november 2007 we acquired turner renewable energy llc and in the future we may acquire additional companies products or technologies we may not realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition and each acquisition has numerous risks these risks include the following 

 

 22 

 

  

mergers and acquisitions of companies are inherently risky and ultimately if we do not complete the integration of acquired businesses successfully and in a timely manner we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions to the extent anticipated which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

if our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 

 

under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of turner renewable energy llc in november 2007 was 334 million we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined resulting in an impact on our results of operations

overview 

 

we design and manufacture solar modules using a proprietary thin film semiconductor technology that has allowed us to reduce our average solar module manufacturing costs to among the lowest in the world each solar module uses a thin layer of cadmium telluride semiconductor material to convert sunlight into electricity we manufacture our solar modules on highthroughput production lines and we perform all manufacturing steps ourselves in an automated proprietary continuous process in 2006 and 2007 we sold most of our solar modules to solar project developers and system integrators headquartered in germany 

 

currently we manufacture our solar modules at our perrysburg ohio and frankfurtoder germany manufacturing facilities and conduct our research and development activities at our perrysburg ohio manufacturing facility we completed the qualification of the first production line at our perrysburg ohio plant for high volume production in november 2004 during 2005 the first full year this production line operated at high volume production we reduced our average manufacturing cost per watt to 159 from 294 in 2004 our average manufacturing cost per watt decreased further to 140 in 2006 and to 123 in 2007 when we had both plants operating at high volume production we define average manufacturing cost per watt as the total manufacturing cost incurred during the period divided by the total watts produced during the period by continuing to expand production globally and improve our technology and manufacturing process we believe that we can further reduce our manufacturing costs per watt our objective is to become by 2010 the first solar module manufacturer to offer a solar electricity solution that generates electricity on a nonsubsidized basis at a price equal to the price of retail electricity in key markets in north america europe and asia 

 

first solar was founded in 1999 to bring an advanced thin film semiconductor process into commercial production through the acquisition of predecessor technologies and the initiation of a research development and production program that allowed us to improve upon the predecessor technologies and launch commercial operations in january 2002 from january 2002 to the end of 2005 we sold approximately 28mw of solar modules during 2006 and 2007 we sold approximately 56mw and 201mw of solar modules respectively 

 

on february 22 2006 we were incorporated as a delaware corporation prior to that date we operated as a delaware limited liability company 

 

on november 30 2007 we completed the acquisition of turner renewable energy llc a privately held company which designed and deployed commercial solar projects for utilities and fortune 500 companies in the united states starting in december 2007 we operate this wholly owned subsidiary under the name of first solar electric llc we believe the acquisition of turner renewable energy llc will enable us to develop solar electricity solutions for utility companies in the united states that are seeking cost effective renewable energy solutions for the purpose of meeting renewable portfolio standard requirements the total consideration for the transaction was 343 million excluding exit and transaction costs of 07 million consisting of 280 million in common stock and 63 million in cash see note 5 

 

our fiscal year ends on the saturday on or before december 31 all references to fiscal year 2007 relate to the 52 weeks ended december 29 2007 all references to fiscal year 2006 relate to the 52 weeks ended december 30 2006 and all references to fiscal year 2005 relate to the 53 weeks ended december 31 2005 we use a 13 week fiscal quarter 

 

manufacturing capacity 

 

we commenced low volume commercial production of solar modules with our pilot production line in perrysburg ohio in january 2002 during 2003 and 2004 while continuing to sell solar modules manufactured on our pilot line we designed and built our first replicable highthroughput production line at the ohio plant we ultimately merged most of the equipment from the pilot line into this first production line completing its qualification for full volume production in november 2004 in february 2005 we commenced construction of two additional production lines at our ohio plant we completed the qualification of these two additional production lines for full volume production in august 2006 during the construction of these two production lines we improved certain aspects of our first production line including the building design and layout and the design and manufacture of certain production equipment our twoline ohio expansion represents a “standard building block” 

for building future production facilities or expansions of our existing production facilities our ohio plant currently has an annual manufacturing capacity of 132mw based on the fourth quarter of 2007 average run rate 

 

in february 2006 we commenced construction of our german plant a new manufacturing facility located in frankfurtoder in the state of brandenburg that houses four production lines we completed the qualification of these four additional production lines for full volume production in the third quarter of 2007 in addition on january 24 2007 we entered into a land lease agreement for a manufacturing center site in the kulim hitech park in the state of kadah malaysia the malaysia site can accommodate two four line plants on november 1 2007 we exercised an option to lease an adjacent land site that can accommodate an additional two four line plants as of december 29 2007 we do not have any more options to lease more land in malaysia in april 2007 we began construction of plant one of our malaysian manufacturing center in the third and fourth quarters of 2007 we began construction of plants two and three respectively and in the first quarter of 2008 we began construction of plant four we expect plant one to reach its full capacity in the second half of 2008 plant two to reach its full capacity in the first half of 2009 and plants three and four to reach full capacity in the second half of 2009 after plant four of our malaysian manufacturing center reaches its full capacity we will have 23 production lines and an annual global manufacturing capacity of approximately 1012mw based on the fourth quarter of 2007 run rate at our existing plants 

 

the following table summarizes our current and inprocess production capacity 

 

 

 

 

  

financial operations overview 

 

the following describes certain line items in our statement of operations and some of the factors that affect our operating results 

 

net sales 

 

we generate substantially all of our net sales from the sale of solar modules over the past four years the main constraint limiting our sales has been production capacity as customer demand has exceeded the number of solar modules we could produce we price and sell our solar modules per watt of power for example during 2007 our average sales price was 248 per watt based on a weighted annual average foreign exchange of 139€100 as a result our net sales can fluctuate based on our output of sellable watts we currently sell almost all of our solar modules to solar project developers and system integrators headquartered in germany france and spain which then resell our solar modules to endusers who receive government subsidies the majority of our sales are denominated in foreign currency and subject to the fluctuation of the exchange rate between the euro and us dollar 

for example the strengthening of the euro contributed 438 million to our net sales during fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 our net sales could be negatively impacted if legislation reduces the current subsidy programs in europe north america or asia or if interest rates increase which could impact our endusers’ ability to either meet their target return on investment or finance their projects 

 

in april 2006 we entered into longterm contracts for the purchase and sale of our solar modules with six european project developers and system integrators and in 2007 we entered into additional longterm contracts for the purchase and sale of our solar modules with six european project developers that also own and operate renewable energy projects collectively the “long term supply contracts” these contracts account for a significant portion of our planned production over the period from 2008 through 2012 and therefore will significantly affect our overall financial performance our long term supply contracts in the aggregate allow for approximately €45 billion 59 billion at an assumed exchange rate of 130€100 in sales from 2008 to 2012 for the sale of a total of 32gw of solar modules 

 

our long term supply contracts entered into in 2006 require us to deliver solar modules each year that in total meet or exceed a specified minimum average number of watts per module for the year under these long term supply contracts we are required to increase the minimum average number of watts per module by approximately 5 annually from 2008 to 2009 and then by 3 for modules delivered in 2012 if we are unable to meet the minimum average annual number of watts per module in a given year we will be in breach of the applicable agreements entitling our customers to certain remedies potentially including the right to terminate their long term supply contracts our long term supply contracts entered into in 2007 do not require a minimum average number of watts per module but provide for a base number of watts per module that increases 34 annually from 2008 to 20102011 and then remains fixed through 2012 and contain a price adjustment per watt if the watts delivered per module are higher or lower than the base number of watts per module all of our long term supply contracts specify a sales price per watt that declines by approximately 65 at the beginning of each year through the expiration date of the contracts in 2012 because the sales prices under our long term supply contracts are fixed and have the builtin decline each year we cannot pass along any increases in manufacturing costs to these customers although we believe that our total manufacturing costs per watt will decline at the same rate or more rapidly than our prices under the long term supply contracts our failure to achieve our manufacturing cost per watt targets could result in a reduction of our gross margin the annual 65 decline in the sales price under the long term supply contracts will reduce our net sales by approximately 56 each year assuming that the rated power of our solar modules remains flat and will impact our cash flow accordingly as a result our profitability could decline if we are unable to reduce our manufacturing cost per watt by at least the same rate as the contractual sales prices decrease furthermore the sales prices under the long term supply contracts are denominated in euros exposing us to risks from currency exchange rate fluctuations 

 

under our customer contracts starting in april 2006 we transfer title and risk of loss to the customer and recognize revenue upon shipment under our customer contracts in effect prior to april 1 2006 we did not transfer title or risk of loss or recognize revenue until the solar modules were received by our customers our customers do not have extended payment terms or rights of return under these contracts 

 

under our long term supply contracts we have the right to terminate certain long term supply contracts upon 12 months notice and the payment of a termination fee if we determine that certain material adverse changes have occurred including depending on the contract one or more of the following new laws rules or regulations with respect to our production distribution installation or collection and recycling program have a substantial adverse impact on our business unanticipated technical or operational issues result in our experiencing widespread persistent quality problems or the inability to achieve stable conversion efficiencies at planned levels or extraordinary events beyond our control substantially increase the cost of our labor materials or utility expenses or significantly reduce our throughput the average termination fee under those agreements is €36 million 47 million at an assumed exchange rate of 130€100 

 

our customers are entitled to certain remedies in the event of missed deliveries of kilowatt volume these delivery commitments are established through rolling four quarter forecasts that are agreed to with each of the customers within the parameters established in the long term supply contracts and define the specific quantities to be purchased on a quarterly basis and the schedules of the individual shipments to be made to the customers in the 

case of a late delivery certain of our customers are entitled to a maximum charge representing a percentage of the delinquent revenue if we do not meet our annual minimum volume shipments our customers also have the right to terminate these contracts on a prospective basis 

 

the information about our long term supply contracts in the preceding paragraphs is intended to summarize the financial terms of the long term supply contracts and is not intended to provide guidance about our future operating results including revenues or profitability 

 

with our acquisition of turner renewable energy llc on november 30 2007 a small portion of our revenues have been accounted for using the percent of completion method of accounting revenues for first solar electric llc for fiscal december 2007 were 37 million and not material to our consolidated results of operations 

 

no single customer accounted for more than 23 of our net sales in 2007 

 

cost of sales 

 

our cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials and components such as tempered back glass tco coated front glass cadmium telluride laminate connector assemblies and laminate edge seal and others our total material cost per solar module has been stable over the past three years even though the cost of tellurium a component of cadmium telluride increased by approximately three times from 2003 to 2007 the increase in the cost of tellurium did not have a significant impact on our total raw material cost per solar module because raw tellurium represents a relatively small portion of our overall material and manufacturing costs historically we have not entered into long term supply contracts with fixed prices for our raw materials starting in 2006 however we entered into multiyear tellurium and cadtel supply contracts in order to mitigate potential cost volatility and secure raw material supplies we expect our raw material cost per watt to decrease over the next several years as costs per solar module remain stable and sellable watts per solar module increase 

 

other items contributing to our cost of sales are direct labor and manufacturing overhead such as engineering expense equipment maintenance environmental health and safety quality and production control and procurement cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing plant and equipment and facility related expenses in addition we accrue warranty and end of life collection and recycling expenses to our cost of sales 

 

we implemented a program in 2005 to collect and recycle our solar modules after their use under our collection and recycling program we enter into an agreement with the endusers of the photovoltaic systems that use our solar modules in the agreement we commit at our expense to remove the solar modules from the installation site at the end of their life and transport them to a processing center where the solar module materials and components will be either refurbished and resold as used panels or recycled to recover some of the raw materials in return the owner agrees not to dispose of the solar modules except through our collection and recycling program or another program that we approve and the photovoltaic system owner is responsible for disassembling the solar modules and packaging them in containers that we provide at the time we sell a solar module we record an expense in cost of sales equal to the present value of the estimated future end of life obligation we record the accretion expense on this future obligation to selling general and administrative expense 

 

overall we expect our cost of sales per watt to decrease over the next several years due to an increase of sellable watts per solar module an increase in unit output per line geographic diversification into lowercost manufacturing regions and more efficient absorption of fixed costs driven by economies of scale 

 

gross profit 

 

gross profit is affected by numerous factors including our average selling prices foreign exchange rates our manufacturing costs and the effective utilization of our production facilities for example our long term supply contracts specify a sales price per watt that declines approximately 65 at the beginning of each year another factor impacting gross profits is the ramp of production on new plants due to a reduced ability to absorb fixed costs until full production volumes are reached as a result gross profits may vary from quarter to quarter and year to year 

research and development 

 

research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and personnelrelated costs and the cost of products materials and outside services used in our process and product research and development activities we continuously add equipment for further process developments and record the depreciation of such equipment as research and development expense we may also allocate a portion of the annual operating cost of the ohio expansion to research and development expense 

 

we maintain a number of programs and activities to improve our technology in order to enhance the performance of our solar modules and of our manufacturing processes we maintain active collaborations with the national renewable energy laboratory a division of the united states department of energy brookhaven national laboratory and several universities we report our research and development expense net of grant funding during the past three years we received grant funding that we applied towards our research and development programs we received 09 million during each of the fiscal years 2005 and 2006 and 18 million during 2007 we expect our research and development expense to increase in absolute terms in the future as we increase personnel and research and development activity over time we expect research and development expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as a result of economies of scale 

 

deferred project costs 

 

deferred project costs represent uninstalled materials relating to customer contracts these costs are recognized as deferred assets until installed deferred project costs as of december 29 2007 were 26 million 

 

selling general and administrative 

 

selling general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated costs professional fees insurance costs travel expense and other selling expenses we expect these expenses to increase in the near term both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales in order to support the growth of our business as we expand our sales and marketing efforts improve our information processes and systems and implement the financial reporting compliance and other infrastructure required for a public company over time we expect selling general and administrative expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as our net sales and our total watts produced increase 

 

production startup 

 

production startup expense consists primarily of salaries and personnelrelated costs and the cost of operating a production line before it has been qualified for full production including the cost of raw materials for solar modules run through the production line during the qualification phase it also includes all expenses related to the selection of a new site and the related legal and regulatory costs and the costs to maintain our plant replication program to the extent we cannot capitalize these expenditures we incurred production startup expenses of 117 million during fiscal year 2006 in connection with the qualification of the ohio expansion and the planning and preparation for operation of the german plant we incurred production startup expenses of 169 million during 2007 in connection with the qualification of the german plant and the planning and preparation of our plants at our malaysian manufacturing center we expect to incur significant production startup expenses in fiscal year 2008 in connection with our plants at the malaysian manufacturing center in general we expect production startup expenses per production line to be higher when we build an entirely new manufacturing facility compared to the addition of new production lines at an existing manufacturing facility primarily due to the additional infrastructure investment required when building an entirely new facility over time we expect production startup expenses to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as a result of economies of scale 

 

interest income 

 

interest income is earned on our cash cash equivalents and marketable securities 

interest expense 

 

interest expense is incurred on various debt financings see “description of certain indebtedness” 

 

foreign currency gain loss 

 

foreign currency gain loss consists of gains and losses resulting from holding assets and liabilities and conducting transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currency the us dollar 

 

income taxes 

 

we were incorporated as a delaware corporation on february 22 2006 as a delaware corporation we are subject to federal and state income taxes prior to february 22 2006 we operated as a delaware limited liability company and were not subject to state or federal income taxes as a result the annual historical financial data included in this annual report on form 10k does not reflect what our financial position and results of operations would have been had we been a taxable corporation for a full fiscal year 

 

at december 29 2007 we had us federal state and nonus net operating loss carryforwards of approximately 1313 million 553 million and 53 million respectively our ability to use these net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on our ability to generate taxable income in future periods and subject to certain international tax laws 

 

certain of our nonus subsidiaries are subject to income taxes in their foreign jurisdictions we expect the tax consequences of our nonus subsidiaries will become significant as we expand our nonus production capacity 

 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities we provide valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized as of december 29 2007 we had net deferred tax assets of 557 million consisting primarily of taxbasis goodwill property plant and equipment economic development funding and sharebased compensation during the year ended december 29 2007 we reversed valuation allowances in the amount of 549 million as of december 30 2006 we had net deferred tax assets of 549 million before valuation allowances consisting primarily of taxbasis goodwill property plant and equipment economic development funding and sharebased compensation 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

in preparing our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap we make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts of reported assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities in our financial statements and the related notes thereto some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in the selection of appropriate assumptions for determining these estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty as a result we cannot assure you that actual results will not differ significantly from estimated results we base our judgments and estimates on our historical experience on our forecasts and on other available information as appropriate our significant accounting policies are further described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december 29 2007 included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

 

our critical accounting policies and estimates which require the most significant management estimates and judgment in determining amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus are as follows 

 

revenue recognition we sell our products directly to system integrators and recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery of the product has occurred and title and risk of loss has passed to the customer the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured this policy is in accordance with the requirements of sec staff accounting bulletin no sab 101 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab 104 revision of topic 13 revenue recognition  under this policy we record a trade receivable for the selling price of our product and reduce 

inventory for the cost of goods sold when delivery occurs in accordance with the terms of the respective sales contracts during 2006 we changed the terms of our sales contracts with all of our significant customers to provide that delivery occurs when we deliver our products to the carrier rather than when the products are received by our customer as had been our terms under our prior contracts this change in the terms of our sales contracts resulted in a onetime increase to our net sales of 54 million during the year ended december 30 2006 we do not offer extended payment terms or rights of return for our sold products 

 

with our acquisition of turner renewable energy llc on november 30 2007 a portion of our revenues will be derived from longterm contracts that we account for under the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants’ statement of position no sop 811 accounting for performance of constructiontype and certain productiontype contracts  accordingly we will record longterm fixedprice contracts on the percentage of completion basis using the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at completion as the measurement basis for progress toward completion and revenue recognition if we identify any losses on contracts we will recognize those losses immediately contract accounting requires significant judgment in assessing risks estimating contract costs and making related assumptions for schedule and technical issues furthermore contract change orders claims and similar items require us to use judgment in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization we only include contract change orders claims and similar items in contract value when we can reliably estimate their amounts and can conclude that their realization is probable 

 

incurred costs include all direct material labor subcontractor cost and those indirect costs related to contract performance such as indirect labor supplies and tools we include job material costs when the job materials have been installed where contracts specify that title to job materials transfers to the customer before installation has been performed we defer revenue and recognize it upon installation using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting we consider job materials to be installed materials when they are permanently attached or fitted to the solar power systems as required by the engineering design 

 

as of december 29 2007 our liability for “billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings” which is part of the balance sheet caption “accounts payable and accrued liabilities” was 21 million this liability represents our billings in excess of revenues recognized on our contracts which results from differences between contractual billing schedules and the timing of revenue recognition under our revenue recognition accounting policies 

 

we also have a limited number of arrangements that include multiple deliverables these are contracts under which we both provide design and consulting services for and supply parts and equipment for solar electricity generation systems we follow the guidance in emerging issues task force issue no eitf 0021 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  when accounting for these arrangements in order to determine whether they have more than one unit of accounting according to eitf 0021 deliverable elements in a revenue arrangement with multiple deliverables are separate units of accounting if the elements have standalone value to the customer if objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered elements is available and if the arrangement does not include a general right of return related to delivered items we determined that our design and supply arrangements generally consist of two elements that qualify as separate units of accounting the provision of design and consulting services and the supply of solar electricity generation system parts and equipment we apply the same revenue recognition principles from sab 104 as we use for our arrangements for the standalone sales of products to the recognition of revenue on the parts and equipment unit of accounting of our multiple deliverable arrangements we recognize revenue from the design and consulting services unit of accounting using the percentage of completion method in accordance with sop 811 

 

end of life collection and recycling at the time of sale we recognize an expense for the estimated fair value of our future obligation for collecting and recycling the solar modules that we have sold once they have reached the end of their useful lives we base our estimate of the fair value of our collection and recycling obligations on the present value of the expected future cost of collecting and recycling the solar modules which includes the cost of packaging the solar module for transport the cost of freight from the solar module’s installation site to a recycling center and the material labor and capital costs of the recycling process and an estimated thirdparty profit margin and return on risk rate for such services we based this estimate on our experience collecting and recycling our solar modules and on our expectations about future developments in recycling technologies and processes and about economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be collected and recycled in the periods between the time of 

our sales and our settlement of the collection and recycling obligations we accrete the carrying amount of the associated liability by applying the discount rate used in its initial measurement we charged 25 million and 89 million to cost of sales for the fair value of our collection and recycling obligation for solar modules sold during the fiscal year ended december 30 2006 and december 29 2007 respectively during the year ended december 30 2006 the accretion expense on our collection and recycling obligations was insignificant and during the year ended december 29 2007 the accretion expense was 03 million an increase of 10 or a decrease of 10 in our estimate of the future cost of collecting and recycling each solar module would result in a 10 increase or decrease respectively in our annual collection and recycling cost accrual a 10 increase in the rate we use to discount the future estimated cost would result in a 9 decrease in our estimated costs and a 10 decrease in the rate would result in a 10 increase in the cost 

 

product warranties we provide a limited warranty to the owner of our solar modules for five years following delivery for defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions we also warrant to the owner of our solar modules that solar modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 90 of their initial power output rating within the first 10 years following their installation and at least 80 of their initial power output rating within the following 15 years our warranties are automatically transferred from the original purchaser of our solar modules to a subsequent purchaser we accrue warranty costs when we recognize sales using amounts estimated based on our historical experience with warranty claims our monitoring of field installation sites and inhouse testing during the fiscal year ended december 31 2005 we reduced our estimate of our product warranty liability by 10 million because lower manufacturing costs reduced our estimate of the cost required to replace our solar modules under warranty during the fiscal years ended december 30 2006 and december 29 2007 this estimate did not require further significant adjustments 

 

sharebased compensation in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no sfas 123r sharebased payment  which requires companies to recognize compensation expense for all sharebased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options in their statements of operations based on the fair value of the awards and we adopted sfas 123r during the first quarter of the fiscal year ended december 31 2005 using the “modified retrospective” method of transition in march 2005 the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no sab 107 which provides guidance regarding the implementation of sfas 123r in particular sab 107 provides guidance regarding calculating assumptions used in sharebased compensation valuation models the classification of sharebased compensation expense the capitalization of sharebased compensation costs and disclosures in management’s discussion and analysis in filings with the sec 

 

determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of sharebased awards at the date of grant using the valuation model requires judgment we use the blackscholesmerton valuation formula to estimate the fair value of employee stock options which is consistent with the provisions of sfas no 123r option pricing models including the blackscholesmerton formula require the use of input assumptions including expected volatility expected term expected dividend rate and expected riskfree rate of return because our stock has only recently become publicly traded we do not have a meaningful observable shareprice volatility therefore we estimate our expected volatility based on that of similar publiclytraded companies and expect to continue to do so until such time as we might have adequate historical data from our own traded share price we estimated our options’ expected terms using our best estimate of the period of time from the grant date that we expect the options to remain outstanding if we determine another method to estimate expected volatility or expected term is more reasonable than our current methods or if another method for calculating these input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance the fair value calculated for future sharebased awards could change significantly from those used for past awards even if the critical terms of the awards are similar higher volatility and expected terms result in an increase to sharebased compensation determined at the date of grant the expected dividend rate and expected riskfree rate of return are not as significant to the calculation of fair value 

 

in addition sfas no 123r requires us to develop an estimate of the number of sharebased awards which we expect to vest quarterly changes in our estimates of award forfeiture rates can have a significant effect on reported sharebased compensation increases to the estimated forfeiture rate will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements during the quarter of the change and future quarters decreases in the estimated forfeiture rate will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements during the 

quarter of the change and future quarters these adjustments affect our cost of sales research and development expenses selling general and administrative and production startup expenses the adjustments to our estimates of the number of sharebased awards that we expect to vest reduced our sharebased compensation expense by 06 million in the fiscal year ended december 30 2006 and increased our sharebased compensation expense by 29 million in the fiscal year ended december 29 2007 adjustments to our estimates of the number of sharebased awards that we expect to vest did not have a significant impact on our financial statements for any prior year the expense we recognize in future periods could differ significantly from the current period andor our forecasts due to adjustments in the estimated number of sharebased awards that we expect to vest 

 

valuation of longlived assets our longlived assets include manufacturing equipment and facilities our business requires significant investment in manufacturing facilities that are technologically advanced but that may become obsolete through changes in our industry or the fluctuations in demand for our solar modules we account for our longlived tangible assets and definitelived intangible assets in accordance with sfas 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets as a result we assess longlived assets classified as “held and used” including our property plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances arise that may indicate that the carrying amount of the longlived assets may not be recoverable these events would include significant current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of such losses significant changes in the manner of use of assets and significant negative industry or economic trends we evaluated our longlived assets for impairment during 2007 and did not note any triggering events that the carrying values of material longlived assets are not recoverable 

 

accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with sfas 109 accounting for income taxes we operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions under several legal forms as a result we are subject to the jurisdiction of a number of us and nonus tax authorities and to tax agreements and treaties among these governments our operations in these different jurisdictions are taxed on various bases including income before taxes calculated in accordance with jurisdictional regulations determining our taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the relevant tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions about significant future events including the following the amount timing and character of deductions permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits changes in tax laws regulations agreements and treaties currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the amount of income tax assets liabilities expenses and benefits that we record during any given period 

 

the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate taxing jurisdictions during the future periods in which the related temporary differences become deductible we determine the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas 109 which require us to weigh both positive and negative evidence in order to ascertain whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized we evaluate all significant available positive and negative evidence including the existence of cumulative net losses benefits that could be realized from available tax strategies and forecasts of future taxable income in determining the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 

 

certain effects of the acquisition of turner renewable energy llc the turner renewable energy llc “tre” acquisition is being accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with fasb statement no 141 business combinations  under the purchase method of accounting tre’s results of operations and the impact of the completion of the acquisition will be reflected in our financial statements on a prospective basis 

 

fiscal december 2007 financial results for first solar electric llc formerly turner renewable energy llc were immaterial to our consolidated results of operations 

 

goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired companies over the estimated fair value assigned to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed we do not amortize goodwill but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually and if necessary would record any impairment in accordance with fas 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” we will perform the first annual impairment review in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 or earlier if facts and circumstances warrant a review in the process of our annual 

impairment review we primarily use the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of our goodwill significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation 

 

marketable securities we have classified our marketable securities as “availableforsale” such marketable securities are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income loss until realized realized gains and losses on sales of all such securities are reported in earnings computed using the specific identification cost method all of our availableforsale marketable securities are subject to a periodic impairment review we consider our marketable debt securities impaired when a significant decline in the issuer’s credit quality is likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment investments identified as being impaired are subject to further review to determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired in which case the investment is written down to its impaired value and a new cost basis is established 

 

results of operations 

 

the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december 29 2007 december 30 2006 and december 31 2005 

 

 

 

fiscal years ended december 29 2007 and december 30 2006 

 

net sales 

 

 

 

the increase in our net sales was due primarily to a 259 increase in the mw volume of solar modules sold in 2007 compared to 2006 we were able to increase the mw volume of solar modules sold primarily as a result of the production ramp at our german plant the full production of our ohio expansion and continued improvements to our overall process in addition we increased the average number of sellable watts per solar module by approximately 11 in 2007 compared with 2006 our average selling price in 2007 increased to 248 from 239 in 2006 our average selling price was positively impacted by 021 due to a favorable foreign exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro and partially offset by a price decline of 012 approximately 91 of our net sales in 2007 resulted from sales of solar modules to customers headquartered in germany 

cost of sales 

 

 

 

direct material expense increased by 873 million warranty and end of life costs relating to the collection and recycling of our solar modules increased by 91 million sales freight and other costs increased by 32 million in each case primarily as a result of higher production volumes in 2007 compared with 2006 in addition manufacturing overhead costs increased by 722 million which was primarily composed of an increase in salaries and personnel related expenses of 430 million including an increase in sharebased compensation expense from 42 million in 2006 to 95 million in 2007 resulting from the infrastructure associated with our ohio expansion and german plant buildout facility and related expenses of 160 million and depreciation expense of 132 million primarily as a result of additional equipment becoming operational at our ohio and german plants 

 

gross profit 

 

 

 

gross profit increased by 1972 million or 363 from 542 million in 2006 to 2514 million in 2007 reflecting an increase in net sales as a percentage of sales gross margin increased 97 percentage points from 402 in 2006 to 499 2007 representing increased leverage of our fixed cost infrastructure and scalability associated with our plant expansions which drove a 259 increase in the number of megawatts sold additionally we incurred 76 million of costs or 15 of revenues associated with the ramp of our german plant in 2007 compared with 11 million of costs or 08 of revenues incurred in 2006 related to the ramp of our ohio expansion for fiscal 2007 foreign exchange gains contributed approximately 3 percentage points to our gross margin offsetting the majority of our annual contractual price decline 

 

research and development 

 

 

 

the increase in research and development expense was primarily the result of a 79 million increase in personnel related expense including an increase in sharebased compensation expense from 23 million in 2006 to 47 million in 2007 due to increased headcount and additional sharebased compensation awards consulting and other expenses also increased by 17 million and grant revenue increased by 09 million in 2007 compared to 2006 

 

selling general and administrative 

 

 

selling general and administrative expense increased primarily as a result of an increase in salaries and personnelrelated expenses of 361 million due to increased headcount and an increase in sharebased compensation from 53 million in 2006 to 234 million in 2007 in addition legal and professional service fees increased by 113 million and other expenses increased by 15 million during 2007 primarily resulting from costs incurred in connection with being a public company and infrastructure build out to support our growth 

 

production startup 

 

 

 

in 2007 we incurred 169 million of production startup expenses related to our german and malaysia expansions including legal regulatory and personnel costs compared with 117 million of production startup expenses for our ohio and german plant expansions during 2006 production startup expenses are primarily attributable to the cost of labor and material and depreciation expense to run and qualify the line related facility expenses management of our replication process and legal and regulatory costs 

 

foreign exchange gain 

 

 

 

foreign exchange gain decreased by 37 million from 2006 to 2007 primarily as a result of hedging the foreign exchange exposure in 2007 to mitigate some of the impact on the fluctuating dollar 

 

interest income 

 

 

 

the increase in interest income of 178 million was primarily due to increased interest income resulting from higher cash cash equivalent and marketable securities balances throughout 2007 we completed an initial public offering in the fourth quarter of 2006 which resulted in net proceeds of 3027 million and an equity followon public offering in the third quarter of 2007 which provided us with net proceeds of 3660 million we also had higher investments in 2007 compared to 2006 that generated interest at higher rates 

 

interest expense net 

 

 

 

interest expense net of amounts capitalized increased by 13 million or 124 from 2006 to 2007 primarily as a result of increased borrowings associated with our german plant financing in 2007 we capitalized 38 million of interest expense to construction in progress compared to 33 million in 2006 

other expense 

 

 

 

the increase in other expense of 04 million was primarily due to increased financing fees related to the ikb loans 

 

income tax benefit expense 

 

 

 

our 2007 annual income tax benefit was 24 million the 2007 tax rate was a benefit of 15 which primarily reflects the net of a tax rate of 337 and a rate benefit of 352 due to the reversal of a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets of 549 million the reversal was based upon our updated assessment of the future realization of our deferred income tax assets the available positive evidence during fiscal 2007 included cumulative taxable income for the previous twelve quarters and a projection of future taxable income the income tax expense for 2006 was the result of a change in corporate form from a limited liability company to a corporation profitability in 2006 and a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 

 

fiscal years ended december 30 2006 and december 31 2005

net sales increased by 869 million or 181 from 481 million in 2005 to 1350 million in 2006 the increase in our net sales was due primarily to a 184 increase in the mw volume of solar modules sold in 2006 compared to 2005 we were able to increase the mw volume of solar modules sold primarily as a result of higher throughput our conversion from a five day to a seven day production week and the full production ramp of our ohio expansion net sales in 2006 also benefited from a change in our shipping terms from delivered duty paid to carriage and insurance paid which became effective in the second quarter of 2006 this change affected revenue recognition by 54 million of intransit inventory during the first half of 2006 in addition we increased the average number of sellable watts per solar module from approximately 59 watts in 2005 to approximately 63 watts in 2006 the increase in net sales was partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price per watt from 243 in 2005 to 239 in 2006 our average selling price was positively impacted by 005 due to a favorable foreign exchange rate between the us dollar and euro strong demand from other customers allowed us to reduce our dependence on our largest customer from 45 of net sales in 2005 to 19 of net sales in 2006 in both periods almost all of our net sales resulted from sales of solar modules to customers headquartered in germany 

 

cost of sales 

 

 

 

cost of sales increased by 492 million or 156 from 315 million in 2005 to 807 million in 2006 direct material expense increased 216 million warranty and end of life costs relating to the collection and recycling of our solar modules increased 37 million direct labor expense increased 39 million and sales freight and other 

costs increased 12 million in each case primarily as a result of higher production volumes during 2006 compared to 2005 in addition manufacturing overhead costs increased by 189 million which was primarily composed of an increase in salaries and personnel related expenses of 87 million including a 33 million increase in sharebased compensation expense resulting from the conversion from a five day to a seven day production week and the overall infrastructure buildout of our ohio expansion an increase in facility related expenses of 43 million and an increase in depreciation expense of 59 million primarily as a result of additional equipment becoming operational at our ohio expansion 

 

gross profit 

 

 

 

gross profit increased by 377 million or 227 from 166 million in 2005 to 542 million in 2006 reflecting an increase in net sales as a percentage of sales gross margin increased from 345 in 2005 to 402 in 2006 representing increased leverage of our fixed cost infrastructure and scalability associated with the expansion of our ohio plant which drove a 184 increase in the number of mw sold 

 

research and development 

 

 

 

research and development expense increased by 40 million or 168 from 24 million in 2005 to 64 million in 2006 the increase in research and development expense was primarily the result of a 32 million increase in personnel related expense including an increase in sharebased compensation expense from 06 million in 2005 to 23 million in 2006 due to increased headcount and additional option awards consulting and other expenses also increased by 07 million and grant revenue declined by 01 million in 2006 compared to 2005 

 

selling general and administrative 

 

 

 

selling general and administrative expense increased by 175 million or 111 from 158 million in 2005 to 333 million in 2006 selling general and administrative expense increased primarily as a result of an increase in salaries and personnelrelated expenses of 120 million due to increased headcount and an increase in sharebased compensation from 34 million in 2005 to 53 million in 2006 in addition legal and professional service fees increased by 48 million and other expenses increased by 07 million during 2006 primarily resulting from costs incurred in connection with being a public company 

production startup 

 

 

 

in 2006 we incurred 117 million of production startup expenses to qualify our ohio expansion and ramp our german plant including related legal and regulatory costs and increased headcount compared to 32 million of production startup expenses for our ohio expansion during 2005 production startup expenses are primarily attributable to the cost of labor and material to run and qualify the line related facility expenses and management of our replication process 

 

foreign exchange gain loss 

 

 

 

foreign exchange gain increased by 73 million from 2005 to 2006 primarily as a result of favorable currency translation between the us dollar and the euro 

 

interest income 

 

 

 

the increase in interest income of 23 million was primarily due to higher cash balances as a result of our initial public offering in the fourth quarter of 2006 which resulted in net proceeds of approximately 3027 million 

 

interest expense net 

 

 

 

interest expense net of amounts capitalized increased by 06 million from 2005 to 2006 primarily as a result of increased borrowings associated with our german plant financing in 2006 we capitalized 33 million of interest expense to construction in progress compared to 04 million in 2005 

 

other expense income 

 

 

 

the increase in other expense of 09 million was primarily due to increased financing fees 

 

income tax expense 

 

 

the increase in income tax expense was the result of a change in corporate form from a limited liability company to a corporation profitability in 2006 and a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 

 

cumulative effect of change in accounting for sharebased compensation 

 

 

 

the adoption of sfas 123r required a change in the method used to estimate forfeitures of employee stock options resulting in a onetime cumulative effect of 01 million in the first quarter of 2005 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

historically our principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations borrowings from jwma partners llc jwma and its affiliates borrowings from goldman sachs  co equity contributions from jwma and borrowings from local governments capital markets and other sources to fund plant expansions during the fiscal year ended december 30 2006 we received 3027 million in net proceeds from an initial public offering of our common stock during the fiscal year ended december 29 2007 we received 3660 million in net proceeds from a followon offering of our common stock as of december 29 2007 we had 6697 million in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities compared to 3084 million as of december 30 2006 one of our strategies is to expand our manufacturing capacity by building new manufacturing plants and production lines such as the recently completed german plant and the plants currently under construction at our malaysia manufacturing center we expect that each four line manufacturing plant that we are building in malaysia will require a capital expenditure of approximately 1700 million to complete we believe that our current cash cash equivalents marketable securities cash flows from operating activities government grants and low interest debt financings for our german plant will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures needs for at least the next 12 months however if our financial results or operating plans change from our current assumptions we may not have sufficient resources to support our expansion strategy we may engage in one or more debt or equity financings in the future which could result in increased expenses or dilution to our existing stockholders if we are unable to obtain debt or equity financing on reasonable terms we may be unable to execute our expansion strategy see “item 1a risk factors — our future success depends on our ability to build new manufacturing plants and add production lines in a costeffective manner both of which are subject risks and uncertainties” 

 

we spent 701 million in capital expenditures for the ohio expansion through 2006 in addition we spent approximately 1500 million for the buildout of our german plant through 2007 we expect to spend approximately 1700 million to build each of the four plants at our malaysian manufacturing center we spent 2290 million toward the buildout of each of these plants at our malaysian manufacturing center in 2007 and we expect to spend approximately 3770 million in 2008 and an additional 740 million in 2009 a majority of our capital expenditures for 2008 and 2009 will be incurred in foreign currency and therefore are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

foreign exchange risk 

 

our international operations accounted for approximately 988 of our net sales in 2007 and 950 of our net sales in 2006 all of which were denominated in euros as a result we have exposure to foreign exchange risk with respect to almost all of our net sales fluctuations in exchange rates particularly in the us dollar to euro exchange rate affect our gross and net profit margins and could result in foreign exchange and operating losses historically most of our exposure to foreign exchange risk has related to currency gains and losses between the times we sign and settle our sales contracts for example our long term supply contracts obligate us to deliver solar modules at a fixed price in euros per watt and do not adjust for fluctuations in the us dollar to euro exchange rate in 2007 a 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates would have impacted our net sales by 504 million with the expansion of our manufacturing operations into germany and the current expansion into malaysia our operating expenses for the plants in these countries will be denominated in the local currency 

 

our primary foreign currency exposures are transaction cash flow and translation 

 

transaction exposure we have certain assets and liabilities primarily receivables investments and accounts payable including intercompany transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the relevant entity’s functional currency in certain circumstances changes in the functional currency value of these assets and liabilities create fluctuations in our reported consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other instruments to minimize the shortterm foreign currency fluctuations on such assets and liabilities the gains and losses on the foreign exchange forward contracts offset the transaction gains and losses on certain foreign currency receivables investments and payables recognized in earnings 

as of december 29 2007 we had a single outstanding forward foreign exchange hedge contract with a notional value equivalent to €200 million 268 million at a fixed exchange rate of 134€100 maturing in february 2009 to hedge our foreign currency transaction exposure 

 

cash flow exposure we have forecasted future cash flows including revenues and expenses denominated in currencies other than the relevant entity’s functional currency our primary cash flow exposures include future customer collections and vendor payments changes in the relevant entity’s functional currency value will cause fluctuations in the cash flows we expect to receive when these cash flows are realized or settled we may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts or other derivatives to hedge the value of a portion of these cash flows we account for these foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges we initially report the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently reclassified this into earnings when the transaction is settled 

 

the notional amount of our cash flow hedges receiving hedge accounting treatment was €1128 million 1658 million at the balance sheet close rate on december 29 2007 of 147€100 and the losses net of gains recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income as of december 31 2007 were 32 million 

 

earnings translation exposure fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results of operations because we are required to consolidate financial statements of our foreign currency denominated subsidiaries we may decide to purchase forward exchange contracts or other instruments to offset the impact of currency fluctuations such contracts would be markedtomarket on a monthly basis and any unrealized gain or loss would be recorded in interest and other income net we do not hedge translation exposure at this time but may do so in the future 

 

interest rate risk 

 

we are exposed to interest rate risk because many of our endusers depend on debt financing to purchase and install a solar electricity generation system although the useful life of a solar electricity generation system is approximately 25 years endusers of our solar modules must pay the entire cost of the system at the time of installation as a result many of our endusers rely on debt financing to fund their upfront capital expenditure and final project an increase in interest rates could make it difficult for our endusers to secure the financing necessary to purchase and install a system on favorable terms or at all and thus lower demand for our solar modules and system development services and reduce our net sales in addition we believe that a significant percentage of our endusers install solar electricity generation systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt an increase in interest rates could lower an investor’s return on investment in a system or make alternative investments more attractive relative to solar electricity generation systems which in each case could cause these endusers to seek alternative investments that promise higher returns 

 

during july 2006 we entered into the ikb credit facility which bears interest at euribor plus 16 for the term loan euribor plus 20 for the bridge loan and euribor plus 18 for the revolving credit facility as of december 29 2007 we hedged our exposure to changes in euribor using interest rate swaps with a combined notional value of €460 million 676 million at the balance sheet close rate on december 29 2007 of 147€100 

 

in addition we invest some of our cash in debt securities which exposes us to interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate for example if we hold a security that was issued with an interest rate fixed at the thenprevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises the principal amount of our investment will probably decline to minimize this risk we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities including money market funds government and nongovernment debt securities and certificates of deposit as of december 29 2007 our fixedincome investments earned a pretax yield of approximately 54 with a weighted average maturity of three months if interest rates were to instantaneously increase decrease by 

100 basis points the fair market value of our total investment portfolio could decrease increase by approximately 16 million

we are exposed to price risks associated with raw material and component purchases most significantly tellurium presently we purchase most of our cadmium telluride in compounded form from a limited number of qualified suppliers we have a long term contract with one of our qualified cadmium telluride suppliers which provides for quarterly price adjustments based on the cost of tellurium commencing in 2006 we entered into multiyear tellurium supply contracts in order to mitigate potential cost volatility and secure raw material supplies we purchase from our other qualified supplier on a purchase order basis because the sale prices of solar modules in our long term supply contracts do not adjust for raw material price increases and are generally for a longer term than our raw materials and component supply contracts we may be unable to pass on increases in the cost of our raw materials or components to many of our customers 

 

in addition most of our key raw materials and components are either solesourced or sourced from a limited number of thirdparty suppliers as a result the failure of any of our suppliers to perform could disrupt our supply chain and impair our operations if our existing suppliers fail to perform we will be required to identify and qualify new suppliers a process that can take up to 12 months depending on the raw material or component we might be unable to identify new suppliers or qualify their products for use on our production line on a timely basis and on commercially reasonable terms

 item 9a   controls and procedures tableend  

  

we maintain “disclosure controls and procedures” as such term is defined in rule 13a15e and 15d15e under the exchange act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met additionally in designing disclosure controls and procedures our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures the design of any disclosure control and procedure also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 

 

based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level 

 

  

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 29 2007 based on the criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 

 

we have excluded first solar electric llc from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of december 29 2007 because it was acquired by us in a purchase business combination consummated on november 30 2007 first solar electric llc is a wholly owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues represent approximately three percent and one percent respectively of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended december 29 2007 

 

based on the results of our evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 29 2007 

 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 29 2007 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which appears herein 

 

  

there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter ended december 29 2007 covered by this annual report on form 10k that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within our company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

 item 1 business 

 

we design and manufacture solar modules using a proprietary thin film semiconductor technology that has allowed us to reduce our average solar module manufacturing costs to among the lowest in the world in 2006 our average manufacturing costs were 140 per watt which we believe is significantly less than those of traditional crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers by continuing to expand production and improve our technology and manufacturing process we believe that we can further reduce our manufacturing costs per watt and improve our cost advantage over traditional crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers 

 

we manufacture our solar modules on highthroughput production lines and perform all manufacturing steps ourselves in an automated continuous process our solar modules employ a thin layer of cadmium telluride semiconductor material to convert sunlight into electricity we are the first company to integrate nonsilicon thin film technology into high volume lowcost production in less than three hours we transform an inexpensive 2ft × 4ft 60cm × 120cm sheet of glass into a complete solar module using approximately 1 of the semiconductor material used to produce crystalline silicon solar modules our manufacturing process eliminates the multiple supply chain operators and expensive and time consuming batch processing steps that are used to produce a crystalline silicon solar module producing low cost solar modules without crystalline silicon has allowed us to grow rapidly to meet market demand during a period of time when silicon feedstock supply shortages and price volatility are limiting the growth of many of our competitors 

 

our net sales grew from 135 million in 2004 to 1350 million in 2006 strong market demand a positive customer response to our solar modules and our ability to expand production without raw material constraints present us with the opportunity to expand sales rapidly and increase market share during 2006 we entered into longterm solar module supply contracts the “long term supply contracts” with six european project developers and system integrators which initially allowed for approximately €12 billion 16 billion at an assumed exchanged rate of 130€100 in sales from 2006 to 2011 for the manufacture and sale of a total of 795 mw of solar modules in december 2006 we exercised our option under each of our long term supply contracts to increase the sales volumes and extend each contract through 2012 we also amended the contracts with four of our customers in january 2007 to further increase the sales volumes over the duration of each contract as a result of the 

option exercises and amendments as of january 9 2007 our long term supply contracts allowed for approximately €23 billion 30 billion at an assumed exchange rate of 130€100 in sales from 2006 to 2012 for the manufacture and sale of a total of 1554mw of solar modules of which 50mw was sold in 2006 the information in this paragraph is designed to summarize the financial terms of the long term supply contracts and is not intended to provide guidance about our future operating results including revenues or profitability 

 

in order to satisfy our contractual requirements and address additional market demand we are in the process of expanding our manufacturing name plate capacity to 175mw annually by the second half of 2007 in august 2006 we completed our ohio expansion adding two 25mw production lines to our existing 25mw base plant we describe our production capacity with a “nameplate” rating which means minimum expected annual production currently we assign each production line a 25 mw nameplate rating in reality we expect actual annual production per line to exceed 25 mw over time as a result of continuous improvement in module throughput and watts per module or conversion efficiency with the completion of our ohio expansion we have an annual manufacturing capacity of 75mw and are the largest thin film solar manufacturer in the world we are also building a four line 100mw plant in germany after our german plant reaches full capacity which we expect to occur during the second half of 2007 we will have an annual manufacturing capacity of 175mw on january 25 2007 we announced that we will begin building a 100mw plant in malaysia that is scheduled to begin production in the second half of 2008 when the malaysian plant is completed we expect to have annual manufacturing capacity of 275 mw to complete each new production line we will continue to use a systematic replication process that is designed to enable us to add production lines rapidly and efficiently and achieve operating metrics in new plants that are comparable to the performance of our base plant 

 

products 

 

solar modules 

 

each solar module is approximately 2ft × 4ft 60cm × 120cm and had an average rated power of approximately 64 watts for 2006 our solar module is a singlejunction polycrystalline thin film structure that employs cadmium telluride as the absorption layer and cadmium sulfide as the window layer cadmium telluride has absorption properties that are highly matched to the solar spectrum and has the potential to deliver competitive conversion efficiencies with approximately 1 of the semiconductor material used by traditional crystalline silicon solar modules our thin film technology also has relatively high energy performance in low light and high temperature environments compared to traditional crystalline silicon solar modules 

 

certifications 

 

we have participated or are currently participating in laboratory and field tests with the national renewable energy laboratory the arizona state university photovoltaic testing laboratory the fraunhofer institute for solar energy tÜv immissionsschutz und energiesysteme gmbh and the institute für solar energieversorgungstechnik currently we have approximately 10000 solar modules installed worldwide at test sites designed to collect data for field performance validation using data logging equipment we also monitor approximately 172000 solar modules representing approximately 10mw of installed photovoltaic systems in use by the endusers that have purchased systems using our solar modules the modules in these monitored systems represent approximately 10 of all solar modules shipped by us from 2002 through 2006 

 

we maintain all certifications required to sell solar modules in the markets we serve or expect to serve including ul 1703 iec 61646 tÜv safety class ii and ce 

 

solar module warranty 

 

we provide a limited warranty to the owner of our solar modules for five years following delivery for defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions we also warrant to the owner of our solar modules that solar modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 90 of their power output rating during the first 10 years following their installation and at least 80 of their power output rating during the following 15 years in resolving claims under both the defects and power output warranties we have the option of either repairing or replacing the covered solar module or under the power output warranty 

providing additional solar modules to remedy the power shortfall our warranties may be transferred from the original purchaser of our solar modules to a subsequent purchaser as of december 30 2006 our accrued warranty expense was 28 million 

 

recycling program 

 

we believe we are the first company in the photovoltaic industry to implement a reclamation and recycling program for our solar modules that will provide full product life cycle stewardship under the long term supply contracts and other customer contracts that we enter into with project developer and system integrator customers we agree to enter into a solar module reclamation and recycling agreement with each enduser and our customers agree to transfer the solar module reclamation and recycling agreement to the enduser and provide us with contact information for each enduser if our customers resell our solar modules we enter into the solar module reclamation and recycling agreement directly with the enduser 

 

endusers can return their solar modules to us for reclamation and recycling at no cost at any time we prefund the estimated recycling cost at the time of sale assuming for this purpose a service life of approximately 20 years for our solar modules in addition to achieving substantial environmental benefits our solar module recycling program may provide us the opportunity to recover certain raw materials and components for reuse in our manufacturing process 

 

customers 

 

during 2006 we entered into long term supply contracts with our six principal customers for the manufacture and sale of solar modules these customers are blitzstrom gmbh conergy ag gehrlicher umweltschonende energiesysteme gmbh juwi solar gmbh phönix sonnenstrom ag and reinecke  pohl sun energy ag these customers are project developers and system integrators and are headquartered in germany the contracts initially allowed for approximately €12 billion 16 billion at an assumed exchanged rate of 130€100 in effect as of december 30 2006 in sales from 2006 to 2011 for the manufacture and sale of a total of 795 mw of solar modules in december 2006 we exercised our option under each of our long term supply contracts to increase the sales volumes and extend each contract through 2012 we also amended the contracts with four of our customers in january 2007 to further increase the sales volumes over the duration of each contract as a result of the option exercises and amendments as of january 9 2007 our long term supply contracts allowed for approximately €23 billion 30 billion at an assumed exchange rate of 130€100 in sales from 2006 to 2012 for the manufacture and sale of a total of 1554mw of solar modules of which 50mw was sold in 2006 the information in this paragraph is intended to summarize the financial terms of the long term supply contracts and is not intended to provide guidance about our future operating results including revenues or profitability 

 

in 2005 and 2006 our principal customers were blitzstrom gmbh conergy ag gehrlicher umweltschonende energiesystem gmbh juwi solar gmbh phönix sonnenstrom ag and reinecke  pohl sun energy ag during 2006 five of our customers each accounted for between 16 to 19 of our net sales all other customers individually accounted for less than 10 of our net sales the loss of any of our major customers could have an adverse effect on our business as we expand our manufacturing capacity we anticipate developing additional customer relationships in germany and in other markets and regions which will reduce our customer and geographic concentration and dependence 

 

our customers sell turnkey solar systems to endusers that include owners of land designated as former agricultural land waste land or conversion land individual owners of agricultural buildings owners of commercial warehouses offices and industrial buildings public agencies and municipal government authorities that own buildings suitable for solar system deployment and financial investors that desire to own large scale solar projects 

 

manufacturing 

 

manufacturing process 

 

we have integrated our manufacturing processes into a single production line with the following three stages the “deposition” stage the “cell definition” stage and the “assembly and test” stage except for operators 

performing quality control and monitoring functions the only stage requiring manual processing is the final assembly and test stage as a result of our automated production process we employ 20 people per production line for each of our four shifts or a total of 80 people per production line for 24 hours per day seven days per week production 

 

the deposition process begins with the robotic loading of 2ft × 4ft 60cm × 120cm panels of lowcost tin oxidecoated soda lime glass on to the production line where they are cleaned and chamfered to produce the strong defect free edges necessary for subsequent processing steps following cleaning the glass panels move automatically into a vacuum chamber where they are heated to near the softening point and coated with a layer of cadmium sulfide followed by a layer of cadmium telluride using our proprietary vapor transport deposition technology each layer takes less than 45 seconds to deposit and uses approximately 1 of the semiconductor material used in crystalline silicon solar modules our ability to deposit the semiconductor materials quickly and uniformly is critical to producing low cost high quality solar modules next we cool the semiconductorcoated plate rapidly to increase its strength the deposition stage concludes with a recrystallization step that reduces defects within the crystals and minimizes the recombination that occurs between grain boundaries 

 

in our cell definition stage we use a series of lasers to transform the large single semiconductorcoated plate into a series of interconnected cells that deliver the desired current and voltage output our proprietary laser scribing technology is capable of accomplishing accurate and complex scribes at high speeds 

 

finally in the assembly and test stage we apply busbars eva ethyl vinyl acetate laminate a rear glass cover sheet and termination wires seal the joint box and subject each solar module to a solar simulator and current leakage tests the final assembly stage is the only stage in our production line that requires manual processing 

 

all of our solar modules are produced at our perrysburg ohio facility which has received both an iso 90012000 quality system certification and iso14001 environmental system certification 

 

manufacturing capacity expansion 

 

we are in the process of expanding our name plate manufacturing capacity to 175mw by the end of 2007 in august 2006 we completed our ohio expansion by adding two 25mw production lines to our existing 25mw base plant which increased our annual manufacturing capacity to 75mw we are also building a four line 100mw manufacturing plant in germany after our german plant reaches full capacity which we expect to occur by the end of 2007 we will have an annual manufacturing capacity of 175mw on january 24 2007 we entered into a land lease for a site in the kulim hitech park in the state of kadah malaysia that can accommodate up to two 100mw plants and includes an option exercisable over 6 years for an adjacent land site that could accommodate up to another eight lines and we expect construction of the 100mw malaysia plant to begin in the second quarter of 2007 to complete each new production line we plan to use a systematic replication process designed to enable us to add production lines rapidly and efficiently and achieve operating metrics in new plants that are comparable to the performance of our base plant 

 

raw materials 

 

our manufacturing process uses approximately twenty raw materials to construct a complete solar module of those raw materials the following nine are critical to our manufacturing process tco coated front glass cadmium sulfide cadmium telluride photo resist eva laminate tempered back glass cord platecord plate cap lead wire ul and tÜv and solar connectors before we use these materials in our manufacturing process a supplier must undergo a qualification process that can last from one to twelve months depending on the type of raw material although we continually evaluate new suppliers and currently are qualifying several new suppliers most of our critical materials are supplied by only one or two sources 

 

the most critical raw material in our production process is cadmium telluride presently we purchase all of our cadmium telluride in compounded form from one manufacturer we have a three year written contract with one of our suppliers that provides for quarterly price adjustments based on the cost of tellurium as other suppliers become qualified we will purchase cadmium telluride from our other supplier under quarterly purchase orders we acquire the remainder of our raw materials under quarterly purchase orders at prices based on annual volumes 

because the sales prices in our long term supply contracts with our customers do not adjust for raw material price increases and these contracts are for a longer term than our raw material supply contracts we may be unable to pass on any increases in the cost of our raw materials to these customers 

 

research development and engineering 

 

we continue to devote a substantial amount of resources to research and development with the objective of lowering the per watt cost of solar electricity generated by photovoltaic systems using our solar modules to a level that competes on a nonsubsidized basis with the price of retail electricity in key markets in the united states europe and asia by 2010 to reduce the per watt cost of electricity generated by photovoltaic systems using our solar modules we focus our research and development on the following areas 

 

  

we believe that our ability to achieve higher module efficiencies is primarily a function of transferring technology that we have demonstrated in the laboratory and in pilot production into highthroughput module production by making incremental improvements to the solar module and the manufacturing process our process development activities encompass laboratory level research and development device modeling process optimization and the qualification of process improvements in highthroughput production during 2007 we plan to add more equipment for further process developments at our perrysburg ohio facility in addition we reserve a portion of the production capacity of our base plant to conduct structured experiments related to our process development 

 

  

we intend to qualify process and product improvements for full production on our ohio expansion production lines and then integrate them into our other production lines our scientists and engineers will collaborate across all manufacturing plants to drive improvement we intend to implement validate and qualify such improvements at the ohio expansion before we deploy them to all of our production lines we believe that this systematic approach to research and development will provide continuous improvements and ensure uniform adoption across our production lines 

 

we maintain active collaborations with the national renewable energy laboratory a division of the us department of energy brookhaven national laboratory and several universities since 2004 we have invested in excess of 127 million into our research and development expenses and received 28 million of grant funding 

 

sales and marketing 

 

we launched the marketing and sale of our solar modules in germany in 2003 because germany has attractive feedin tariffs a high forecasted growth rate for renewable energy and market segments that we believe are well 

served by our product since 2003 our focus has remained on gridconnected ground or roof mounted photovoltaic systems in germany because similar to other solar module manufacturers we currently cannot compete with conventional sources of electricity on a cost basis unless endusers receive government subsidies while our goal is to reduce the cost of solar electricity to levels that can compete with fossil fuels and other conventional sources of electricity we believe that most of our distribution in the immediate future will be for use in gridconnected photovoltaic systems with some form of government subsidies 

 

government subsidies 

 

countries in europe canada and asia and several states in the united states have adopted a variety of government subsidies to allow renewable sources of electricity to compete with conventional sources of electricity such as fossil fuels government subsidies and incentives generally focus on gridconnected systems and take several forms including feedin tariffs net metering programs renewable portfolio standards rebates tax incentives and low interest loans 

 

under a feedin tariff subsidy the government sets prices that regulated utilities are required to pay for renewable electricity generated by endusers the prices are set above market rates and may differ based on system size or application net metering programs enable endusers to sell excess solar electricity to their local utility in exchange for a credit against their utility bills net metering allows endusers to get “full value” for the electricity generated by renewable sources rather than receiving a less desirable rate the policies governing net metering vary by state and utility some utilities pay the enduser upfront while others credit the enduser’s bill net metering is currently offered in 40 states and the district of columbia under a renewable portfolio standard the government requires regulated utilities to supply a portion of their total electricity in the form of renewable electricity some programs further specify that a portion of the renewable energy quota must be from solar electricity 

 

tax incentive programs exist in the united states at both the federal and state level and can take the form of investment tax credits accelerated depreciation and property tax exemptions several governments also facilitate low interest loans for photovoltaic systems either through direct lending credit enhancement or other programs 

 

regulations and policies relating to electricity pricing and interconnection also encourage distributive generation with photovoltaic systems photovoltaic systems generate most of their electricity during the afternoon hours when the demand for and cost of electricity is highest as a result electricity generated by photovoltaic systems mainly competes with expensive peak hour electricity rather than the less expensive average price of electricity modifications to the peak hour pricing policies of utilities such as to a flat rate would require photovoltaic systems to achieve lower prices in order to compete with the price of electricity in addition interconnection policies often enable the owner of a photovoltaic system to feed solar electricity into the power grid without interconnection costs or standby fees 

 

environmental matters 

 

our operations include the use handling storage transportation generation and disposal of hazardous materials we are subject to various federal state local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the use management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes occupational health and safety and the cleanup of contaminated sites therefore we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs fines and civil or criminal sanctions and costs arising from third party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws or noncompliance with environmental permits required at our facilities we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and do not expect to incur material capital expenditures for environmental controls in this or the succeeding fiscal year however future developments such as more aggressive enforcement policies the implementation of new more stringent laws and regulations or the discovery of unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations andor financial condition see item 1a risk factors — “environmental obligations and liabilities could have a substantial negative impact on our financial condition cash flows and profitability” 

 

competition 

 

the solar energy and renewable energy industries are both highly competitive and continually evolving as participants strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete within the larger electric power industry within the renewable energy industry we believe that our main sources of competition are crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers other thin film solar module manufacturers and companies developing solar thermal and concentrated photovoltaic technologies among photovoltaic module and cell manufacturers the principal methods of competition are price per watt production capacity conversion efficiency and reliability we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors 

 

at the end of 2006 the global photovoltaic industry consisted of over 100 manufacturers of photovoltaic cells and solar modules within the pv industry we face competition from crystalline silicon photovoltaic cell and solar module manufacturers including bp solar evergreen solar kyocera motech qcells renewable energy corporation sanyo schott solar sharp solarworld sunpower and suntech we also face competition from thin film solar module manufacturers including antec kaneka mitsubishi heavy industries shell solar and united solar finally our solar module comes in one size measuring 2ft × 4ft 60cm × 120cm in contrast some of our thin film competitors have developed solar products that can be tailored to a customer’s specifications 

 

in addition we expect to compete with future entrants to the photovoltaic industry that offer new technological solutions we may also face competition from semiconductor manufacturers and semiconductor equipment manufacturers or their customers several of which have already announced their intention to start production of photovoltaic cells solar modules or turnkey production lines some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources larger production capacities and greater brand name recognition than we do and may as a result be better positioned to adapt to changes in the industry or the economy as a whole one of our customers conergy ag commenced construction of a plant in germany that will manufacture traditional crystalline silicone photovoltaic solar cells and modules 

 

in addition to manufacturers of pv cells and solar modules we face competition from companies developing solar thermal and concentrated pv technologies 

 

intellectual property 

 

our success depends in part on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technology and to conduct our business without infringing on the proprietary rights of others we rely primarily on a combination of patents trademarks and trade secrets as well as employee and third party confidentiality agreements to safeguard our intellectual property as of december 30 2006 in the united states we held 26 patents which will expire at various times between 2007 and 2023 and had 18 patent applications pending we also held 16 patents and had 37 patent applications pending in foreign jurisdictions our patent applications and any future patent applications might not result in a patent being issued with the scope of the claims we seek or at all and any patents we may receive may be challenged invalidated or declared unenforceable we continually assess appropriate occasions for seeking patent protection for those aspects of our technology designs and methodologies and processes that we believe provide significant competitive advantages a majority of our patents relate to our vapor transport deposition process in which semiconductor material is deposited on glass substrates and our laser scribing process of transforming a large semiconductorcoated plate into a series of interconnected cells 

 

as of december 30 2006 we held 2 trademarks “first solar” and “first solar and design” in the united states we have also registered our “first solar and design” mark in china japan and the european union and we are seeking registration in india 

 

with respect to among other things proprietary knowhow that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests we believe that many elements of our photovoltaic manufacturing process involve proprietary knowhow technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications including technical processes equipment designs algorithms and procedures we have taken security measures to protect these elements all of our research and development personnel have entered into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us these agreements address intellectual property protection issues and require our employees to assign to us all of the 

inventions designs and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us we also require our customers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our solar cells technology or business plans 

 

we have not been subject to any material intellectual property claims 

 

employees 

 

as of december 30 2006 we had 723 employees including 545 in manufacturing and the rest in research and development sales and marketing and general and administration positions none of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by a collective bargaining agreement as we expand domestically and internationally however we may encounter employees who desire union representation we believe that relations with our employees are good

 item 1a risk factors 

 

an investment in our stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as the other information in this annual report on form 10k in evaluating first solar and our business if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected accordingly the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment in our common stock the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks that we currently do not know about or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations 

 

our limited operating history may not serve as an adequate basis to judge our future prospects and results of operations 

 

we have a limited operating history although we began developing our predecessor technology in 1987 we did not complete the qualification of our pilot manufacturing line until january 2002 and our base plant until november 2004 from our launch of commercial operations in january 2002 through the end of 2006 we sold approximately 84mw of solar modules relative to the entire solar energy industry which had a worldwide installed capacity of 5gw or 5000mw at the end of 2005 we have sold only a small percentage of the installed solar modules as such our historical operating results may not provide a meaningful basis for evaluating our business financial performance and prospects while our net sales grew from 135 million in 2004 to 1350 million in 2006 we may be unable to achieve similar growth or to grow at all in future periods accordingly you should not rely on our results of operations for any prior period as an indication of our future performance 

 

we have incurred losses since our inception and may be unable to generate sufficient net sales in the future to sustain profitability 

 

we incurred a net loss of 168 million in 2004 and 65 million in 2005 although we had net income of 40 million in 2006 we still had an accumulated deficit of 1454 million at december 30 2006 and we may incur losses in the future in addition we expect our operating expenses to increase as we expand our operations our ability to sustain profitability depends on a number of factors including the growth rate of the solar energy industry the continued market acceptance of solar modules the competitiveness of our solar modules and services and our ability to increase production volumes if we are unable to generate sufficient net sales to sustain profitability and positive cash flows we could be unable to satisfy our commitments and may have to discontinue operations 

 

thin film technology has a short history and our thin film technology and solar modules may perform below expectations 

 

researchers began developing thin film semiconductor technology over 20 years ago but were unable to integrate the technology into a production line until recently in addition the oldest solar modules manufactured during the qualification of our pilot line have only been in use since 2001 as a result our thin film technology and solar modules do not have a sufficient operating history to confirm how our solar modules will perform over their estimated 25 year useful life if our thin film technology and solar modules perform below expectations we could lose customers and face substantial warranty expense 

 

our failure to further refine our technology and develop and introduce improved photovoltaic products could render our solar modules uncompetitive or obsolete and reduce our net sales and market share 

 

we will need to invest significant financial resources in research and development to keep pace with technological advances in the solar energy industry however research and development activities are inherently uncertain and we could encounter practical difficulties in commercializing our research results our significant expenditures on research and development may not produce corresponding benefits other companies are developing a variety of competing photovoltaic technologies including copper indium gallium diselenide and amorphous silicon that could produce solar modules that prove more costeffective or have better performance than our solar modules as a result our solar modules may be rendered obsolete by the technological advances of others which could reduce our net sales and market share 

 

if photovoltaic technology is not suitable for widespread adoption or if sufficient demand for solar modules does not develop or takes longer to develop than we anticipate our net sales may flatten or decline and we may be unable to sustain profitability 

 

the solar energy market is at a relatively early stage of development and the extent to which solar modules will be widely adopted is uncertain if photovoltaic technology proves unsuitable for widespread adoption or if demand for solar modules fails to develop sufficiently we may be unable to grow our business or generate sufficient net sales to sustain profitability in addition demand for solar modules in our targeted markets including germany may not develop or may develop to a lesser extent than we anticipate many factors may affect the viability of widespread adoption of photovoltaic technology and demand for solar modules including the following 

 

 12 

 

  

our future success depends on our ability to build new manufacturing plants and add production lines in a costeffective manner both of which are subject to risks and uncertainties 

 

our future success depends on our ability to significantly increase both our manufacturing capacity and production throughput in a costeffective and efficient manner if we cannot do so we may be unable to expand our business decrease our cost per watt maintain our competitive position satisfy our contractual obligations or sustain profitability our ability to expand production capacity is subject to significant risks and uncertainties including the following 

 

  

if our future production lines do not achieve operating metrics similar to our base plant our solar modules could perform below expectations and cause us to lose customers 

 

currently our 25mw base plant is our only production line that has a meaningful history of operating at full capacity we added two 25mw production lines in our ohio expansion in august 2006 however they do not have a sufficient operating history for us to determine whether we were successful in replicating the base plant the production lines in our ohio expansion and future production lines could produce solar modules that have lower efficiencies higher failure rates and higher rates of degradation than solar modules from our base plant and we could be unable to determine the cause of the lower operating metrics or develop and implement solutions to achieve similar operating metrics as our base plant the ohio expansion represents a “standard building block” that we intend to replicate in future production facilities and expansions of our existing production facilities including the german plant and the malaysian plant our replication risk in connection with building the german plant the malaysian plant and other future manufacturing plants could be higher than our replication risk in the ohio expansion because we expect the new lines to be located internationally which could entail other factors that will lower the operating metrics if we are unable to systematically replicate our production lines and achieve and sustain similar operating metrics in our ohio expansion and future production lines as our base plant our manufacturing capacity could be substantially constrained our manufacturing costs per watt could increase and we could lose customers causing lower net sales and net income than we anticipate 

 

some of our manufacturing equipment is customized and sole sourced if our manufacturing equipment fails or if our equipment suppliers fail to perform under their contracts we could experience production disruptions and be unable to satisfy our contractual requirements 

 

some of our manufacturing equipment is customized to our production line based on designs or specifications that we provide the equipment manufacturer who then undertakes a specialized production process to manufacture the custom equipment as a result the equipment is not readily available from multiple vendors and would be difficult to repair or replace if it were to become damaged or stop working if any piece of equipment fails production along the entire production line could be interrupted and we could be unable to produce enough solar modules to satisfy our contractual requirements in addition the failure of our equipment suppliers to supply 

equipment in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms could delay our expansion plans and otherwise disrupt our production schedule or increase our manufacturing costs 

 

we may be unable to manage the expansion of our operations effectively 

 

we expect to expand our business significantly in order to meet our contractual obligations satisfy demand for our solar modules and increase market share in august 2006 we expanded our manufacturing capacity from the existing 25mw at our base plant to an aggregate of 75mw with the completion of our ohio expansion we expect to continue expanding our manufacturing capacity to an aggregate of 175mw by the second half of 2007 upon the anticipated qualification of our german plant and 275 mw by the second half of 2008 upon the anticipated completion of our malaysian plant to manage the expansion of our operations we will be required to improve our operational and financial systems procedures and controls increase manufacturing capacity and throughput and expand train and manage our growing employee base our management will also be required to maintain and expand our relationships with customers suppliers and other third parties and attract new customers and suppliers in addition our current and planned operations personnel systems and internal procedures and controls might be inadequate to support our future growth if we cannot manage our growth effectively we may be unable to take advantage of market opportunities execute our business strategies or respond to competitive pressures 

 

we depend on a limited number of thirdparty suppliers for key raw materials and their failure to perform could cause manufacturing delays and impair our ability to deliver solar modules to customers in the required quality and quantities and at a price that is profitable to us 

 

our failure to obtain raw materials and components that meet our quality quantity and cost requirements in a timely manner could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture our solar modules or increase our manufacturing cost most of our key raw materials are either solesourced or sourced by a limited number of thirdparty suppliers as a result the failure of any of our suppliers to perform could disrupt our supply chain and impair our operations in addition many of our suppliers are small companies that may be unable to supply our increasing demand for raw materials as we implement our planned rapid expansion we may be unable to identify new suppliers or qualify their products for use on our production lines in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms raw materials from new suppliers may also be less suited for our technology and yield solar modules with lower conversion efficiencies than solar modules manufactured with the raw materials from our current suppliers 

 

a disruption in our supply chain for cadmium telluride the key component of our semiconductor layer could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture solar modules 

 

the key raw material we use in our production process in the active semiconductor layer is a cadmium telluride compound with the tellurium component of cadmium telluride compound being the most critical currently we purchase all of our cadmium telluride in manufactured form from one manufacturer if any of our current or future suppliers is unable to perform under its contracts or purchase orders our operations could be interrupted or impaired in addition because each supplier must undergo a lengthy qualification process we may be unable to replace a lost supplier in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms our supply of cadmium telluride could also be limited if our suppliers are unable to acquire an adequate supply of tellurium in a timely manner or at commercially reasonable prices if our suppliers cannot obtain sufficient tellurium they could substantially increase their prices or be unable to perform under their contracts we may be unable to pass increases in the cost of our raw materials through to our customers because our customer contracts do not adjust for raw material price increases and are generally for a longer term than our raw material supply contracts 

 

we currently depend on six customers for substantially all of our net sales the loss of or a significant reduction in orders from any of these customers could significantly reduce our net sales and harm our operating results 

 

we currently sell substantially all of our solar modules to six customers headquartered in germany in 2005 sales to our largest customer accounted for approximately 45 of our total net sales during 2006 our largest customers accounted for between 16 and 19 of our net sales the loss of any of our customers or their default in payment could significantly reduce our net sales and adversely impact our operating results in addition our long 

term supply contracts extend through 2012 and we expect them to allocate a significant majority of our production capacity to a limited number of customers as a result we do not expect to have a significant amount of excess production capacity to identify and then build relationships with new customers that could replace any lost customers we anticipate that our dependence on a limited number of customers will continue for the foreseeable future because we have presold approximately twothirds of the planned capacity of our base plant ohio expansion german plant and malaysian plant through 2012 as a result we will have to rely on future expansions to attract and service new customers in addition our customer relationships have been developed over a relatively short period of time and we cannot guarantee that we will have good relations with our customers in the future several of our competitors have more established relationships with our customers and may gain a larger share of our customers’ business over time 

 

if we are unable to further increase the number of sellable watts per solar module and reduce our manufacturing cost per watt we will be in default under our long term supply contracts and our gross profit and gross margin could decrease 

 

our long term supply contracts require us to deliver solar modules that in total meet or exceed a specified minimum average number of watts per module for the year beginning in 2007 we are required to increase the minimum average number of watts per module by approximately 5 annually between 2007 and 2009 and then by an additional 3 for modules delivered in 2012 if we are unable to meet the minimum average annual number of watts per module in a given year we will be in default under the agreements entitling our customers to certain remedies potentially including the right to terminate the contracts in addition our long term supply contracts specify a sales price per watt that declines approximately 65 each year through the expiration date of the contract in 2012 our gross profit and gross margin could decline if we are unable to reduce our manufacturing cost per watt by at least the same rate at which our contractual prices decrease 

 

the reduction or elimination of government subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity applications could reduce demand for our solar modules lead to a reduction in our net sales and adversely impact our operating results 

 

the reduction elimination or expiration of government subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar electricity may result in the diminished competitiveness of solar energy relative to conventional and nonsolar renewable sources of energy and could materially and adversely affect the growth of the solar energy industry and our net sales we believe that the nearterm growth of the market for ongrid applications where solar energy is used to supplement the electricity a consumer purchases from the utility network depends significantly on the availability and size of government and economic incentives currently the cost of solar electricity substantially exceeds the retail price of electricity in every significant market in the world as a result federal state and local governmental bodies in many countries most notably germany italy spain france south korea japan canada and the united states have provided subsidies in the form of feedin tariffs rebates tax writeoffs and other incentives to endusers distributors systems integrators and manufacturers of photovoltaic products for example germany which accounted for 950 of our net sales in 2006 has been a strong supporter of photovoltaic products and systems and political changes in germany could result in significant reductions or the elimination of incentives many of these government incentives expire phase out over time exhaust the allocated funding or require renewal by the applicable authority for example german subsidies decline at a rate of 50 to 65 per year based on the type and size of the photovoltaic system and discussions are currently underway about modifying the german renewable energy law eeg if the german government reduces or eliminates the subsidies under the eeg demand for photovoltaic products could significantly decline in germany in addition the emerging renewables program in california has finite funds that may not last through the current program period california subsidies declined from 280 to 250 per watt in march 2006 and will continue to decline as cumulative installations exceed stated thresholds net metering policies in california which currently only require each investor owned utility to provide net metering up to 25 of its aggregate customer peak demand could also limit the amount of solar power installed within california 

 

in addition if any of these statutes or regulations is found to be unconstitutional or is reduced or discontinued for other reasons sales of our solar modules in these countries could decline significantly which could have a 

material adverse effect on our business and results of operations for example the predecessor to the german eeg was challenged in germany on constitutional grounds and in the european court of justice as impermissible state aid although the german federal high court of justice dismissed these constitutional concerns and the european court of justice held that the purchase requirement at minimum feedin tariffs did not constitute impermissible state aid new proceedings challenging the renewable energies act or comparable minimum price regulations in other countries in which we currently operate or intend to operate may be initiated 

 

electric utility companies or generators of electricity from fossil fuels or other renewable energy sources could also lobby for a change in the relevant legislation in their markets to protect their revenue streams the reduction or elimination of government subsidies and economic incentives for ongrid solar energy applications especially those in our target markets could cause our net sales to decline and materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

currency translation and transaction risk may negatively affect our net sales cost of sales and gross margins and could result in exchange losses 

 

although our reporting currency is the us dollar we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most countries in which we operate as a result we are subject to currency translation risk for example 996 and 950 of our net sales were outside the united states and denominated in euros for the years ended december 31 2005 and december 30 2006 respectively and we expect a large percentage of our net sales to be outside the united states and denominated in foreign currencies in the future changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar could affect our net sales and cost of sales and could result in exchange losses in addition we incur currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from our reporting currency for example our long term supply contracts specify fixed pricing in euros through 2012 and do not adjust for changes in the us dollar to euro exchange rate we cannot accurately predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations as of december 30 2006 we did not engage in any exchange rate hedging activities and as a result any volatility in currency exchange rates may have an immediate adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

 

we could also expand our business into emerging markets many of which have an uncertain regulatory environment relating to currency policy conducting business in such emerging markets could cause our exposure to changes in exchange rates to increase 

 

an increase in interest rates could make it difficult for endusers to finance the cost of a photovoltaic system and could reduce the demand for our solar modules 

 

many of our endusers depend on debt financing to fund the initial capital expenditure required to purchase and install a photovoltaic system as a result an increase in interest rates could make it difficult for our endusers to secure the financing necessary to purchase and install a photovoltaic system on favorable terms or at all and thus lower demand for our solar modules and reduce our net sales in addition we believe that a significant percentage of our endusers install photovoltaic systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt an increase in interest rates could lower an investor’s return on investment in a photovoltaic system or make alternative investments more attractive relative to photovoltaic systems and in each case could cause these endusers to seek alternative investments 

 

we face intense competition from manufacturers of crystalline silicon solar modules thin film solar modules and solar thermal and concentrated photovoltaic systems 

 

the solar energy and renewable energy industries are both highly competitive and continually evolving as participants strive to distinguish themselves within their markets and compete with the larger electric power industry we believe that our main sources of competition are crystalline silicon solar module manufacturers other thin film solar module manufacturers and companies developing solar thermal and concentrated photovoltaic technologies 

 

at the end of 2006 the global photovoltaic industry consisted of over 100 manufacturers of photovoltaic cells and solar modules within the photovoltaic industry we face competition from crystalline silicon photovoltaic cell and solar module manufacturers including bp solar evergreen solar kyocera motech qcells renewable energy corporation sanyo schott solar sharp solarworld sunpower and suntech we also face competition from thin film solar module manufacturers including antec kaneka mitsubishi heavy industries shell solar united solar and several crystalline silicon manufacturers who are developing thin film technologies we may also face competition from semiconductor manufacturers and semiconductor equipment manufacturers or their customers several of which have already announced their intention to start production of photovoltaic cells solar modules or turnkey production lines one of our customers conergy ag commenced construction of a plant in germany that will manufacture traditional crystalline silicone photovoltaic solar cells and modules in addition to manufacturers of photovoltaic cells and solar modules we face competition from companies developing solar thermal and concentrated photovoltaic technologies 

 

many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial technical manufacturing and other resources than we do our competitors’ greater size in some cases provides them with a competitive advantage because they can realize economies of scale and purchase certain raw materials at lower prices many of our competitors also have greater brand name recognition more established distribution networks and larger customer bases in addition many of our competitors have wellestablished relationships with our current and potential distributors and have extensive knowledge of our target markets as a result of their greater size some of our competitors may be able to devote more resources to the research development promotion and sale of their products or respond more quickly to evolving industry standards and changes in market conditions than we can in addition a significant increase in the supply of silicon feedstock or a significant reduction in the manufacturing cost of crystalline silicon solar modules could lead to pricing pressures for solar modules our failure to adapt to changing market conditions and to compete successfully with existing or new competitors may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

 

our substantial international operations subject us to a number of risks including unfavorable political regulatory labor and tax conditions in foreign countries 

 

we have significant marketing and distribution operations outside the united states and expect to continue to have significant manufacturing operations outside the united states in the near future in 2006 950 of our net sales were generated from customers headquartered in germany in the future we expect to have operations in other european countries malaysia and other asian countries and as a result we will be subject to the legal political social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions risks inherent to international operations include but are not limited to the following 

 

 17 

 

  

our business in foreign markets requires us to respond to rapid changes in market conditions in these countries our overall success as a global business depends in part on our ability to succeed in differing legal regulatory economic social and political conditions we may not be able to develop and implement policies and strategies that will be effective in each location where we do business in addition each of the foregoing risks is likely to take on increased significance as we implement our plans to expand our foreign manufacturing operations 

 

problems with product quality or performance may cause us to incur warranty expenses damage our market reputation and prevent us from maintaining or increasing our market share 

 

our solar modules are sold with a five year materials and workmanship warranty for technical defects and a ten year and twentyfive year warranty against declines of more than 10 and 20 of their initial rated power respectively as a result we bear the risk of extensive warranty claims long after we have sold our solar modules and recognized net sales as of december 30 2006 our accrued warranty expense amounted to 28 million 

 

because of the limited operating history of our solar modules we have been required to make assumptions regarding the durability and reliability of our solar modules our assumptions could prove to be materially different from the actual performance of our solar modules causing us to incur substantial expense to repair or replace defective solar modules in the future for example our glassonglass modules could break delaminate or experience power degradation in excess of expectations in addition once our modules are installed and connected but before they are connected to a power grid or there is a load otherwise put on the modules the modules are in an open circuit condition we are continuing to collect data on the long term effects on reliability and service life that results from extended periods of the modules being in an open circuit condition particularly in high ambient temperature conditions although the data available to us to date does not suggest significant deterioration in long term performance of modules that are left in prolonged open circuit condition it may become apparent with future experience that long term performance and service life is affected by the modules being kept in an open circuit condition for prolonged periods of time any widespread product failures may damage our market reputation and cause our sales to decline and require us to repair or replace the defective modules which could have a material adverse effect on our financials results 

 

if our estimates regarding the future cost of reclaiming and recycling our solar modules are incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses from the time we realize our estimates are incorrect and we could also face a significant unplanned cash burden from the time we realize our estimates are incorrect or our endusers return their solar modules 

 

we prefund the estimated future obligation for reclaiming and recycling our solar modules based on the present value of the expected future cost of the reclaiming and recycling process this cost includes the cost of packaging the solar module for transport the cost of freight from the solar module’s installation site to a recycling center and the material labor and capital costs of the recycling process the related expense that we recognize in our financial statements also includes an estimated thirdparty profit margin and risk rate for such services currently we base our estimates on our experience reclaiming and recycling solar modules that do not pass our quality control tests and modules returned under our warranty and on our expectations about future developments in recycling technologies and processes and about economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be reclaimed and recycled if our estimates prove incorrect we could be required to accrue additional expenses from the time we realize our estimates are incorrect and also face a significant unplanned cash burden at the time we realize our estimates are incorrect or endusers return their solar modules which could harm our operating results in addition our endusers can return their solar modules at any time as a result we could be required to reclaim and recycle our solar modules earlier than we expect and before recycling technologies and processes improve 

 

our future success depends on our ability to retain our key employees and to successfully integrate them into our management team 

 

we are dependent on the services of michael j ahearn our chief executive officer bruce sohn our president george a “chip” hambro our chief operating officer jens meyerhoff our chief financial officer ken schultz our vp of sales and marketing and other members of our senior management team the loss of messrs ahearn sohn hambro meyerhoff schultz or any other member of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on us there is a risk that we will not be able to retain or replace these key employees several of our current key employees including messrs ahearn hambro sohn schultz and meyerhoff are subject to employment conditions or arrangements that contain postemployment noncompetition provisions however these arrangements permit the employees to terminate their employment with us upon little or no notice we recently added several members to our senior management team including bruce sohn our new president integrating them into our management team could prove disruptive to our daily operations require a disproportionate amount of resources and management attention and prove unsuccessful 

 

if we are unable to attract train and retain technical personnel our business may be materially and adversely affected 

 

our future success depends to a significant extent on our ability to attract train and retain technical personnel recruiting and retaining capable personnel particularly those with expertise in the photovoltaic industry thin film technology and cadmium telluride are vital to our success there is substantial competition for qualified technical personnel and we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain our technical personnel in addition a significant percentage of our current technical personnel have stock options that vest in 2008 and it may be more difficult to retain these individuals after their options vest if we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees our business may be materially and adversely affected 

 

our failure to protect our intellectual property rights may undermine our competitive position and litigation to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against thirdparty allegations of infringement may be costly 

 

protection of our proprietary processes methods and other technology especially our proprietary vapor transport deposition process and laser scribing process is critical to our business failure to protect and monitor the use of our existing intellectual property rights could result in the loss of valuable technologies we rely primarily on patents trademarks trade secrets copyrights and other contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property we have received patents in the united states and select foreign jurisdictions and we have pending applications in such jurisdictions as well our existing patents and future patents could be challenged invalidated circumvented or rendered unenforceable we have pending patent applications in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents or if patents are issued to us such patents may not be sufficient to provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies 

 

we also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property such confidentiality agreements are limited in duration and could be breached and may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary manufacturing expertise adequate remedies may not be available in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise in addition others may obtain knowledge of our trade secrets through independent development or legal means the failure of our patents or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes equipment technology trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise methods and compounds could have a material adverse effect on our business in addition effective patent trademark copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries in some countries we have not applied for patent trademark or copyright protection 

 

third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary technologies or other intellectual property rights which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology can be difficult and expensive also litigation may be necessary to 

enforce our intellectual property rights protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others we cannot assure you that the outcome of such potential litigation will be in our favor such litigation may be costly and may divert management attention and other resources away from our business an adverse determination in any such litigation will impair our intellectual property rights and may harm our business prospects and reputation in addition we have no insurance coverage against litigation costs and would have to bear all costs arising from such litigation to the extent we are unable to recover them from other parties 

 

we may be exposed to infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties which if determined adversely to us could cause us to pay significant damage awards or prohibit us from the manufacture and sale of our solar modules or the use of our technology 

 

our success depends largely on our ability to use and develop our technology and knowhow without infringing or misappropriating the intellectual property rights of third parties the validity and scope of claims relating to photovoltaic technology patents involve complex scientific legal and factual considerations and analysis and therefore may be highly uncertain we may be subject to litigation involving claims of patent infringement or violation of intellectual property rights of third parties the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits patent opposition proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings can be both costly and time consuming and may significantly divert the efforts and resources of our technical and management personnel an adverse determination in any such litigation or proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liability to third parties require us to seek licenses from third parties which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all or pay ongoing royalties require us to redesign our solar modules or subject us to injunctions prohibiting the manufacture and sale of our solar modules or the use of our technologies protracted litigation could also result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of our solar modules until resolution of the litigation 

 

existing regulations and policies and changes to these regulations and policies may present technical regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of photovoltaic products which may significantly reduce demand for our solar modules 

 

the market for electricity generation products is heavily influenced by foreign federal state and local government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry as well as policies promulgated by electric utilities these regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customerowned electricity generation in the united states and in a number of other countries these regulations and policies have been modified in the past and may be modified again in the future these regulations and policies could deter enduser purchases of photovoltaic products and investment in the research and development of photovoltaic technology for example without a mandated regulatory exception for photovoltaic systems utility customers are often charged interconnection or standby fees for putting distributed power generation on the electric utility grid these fees could increase the cost to our endusers of using photovoltaic systems and make them less desirable thereby harming our business prospects results of operations and financial condition in addition electricity generated by photovoltaic systems mostly competes with expensive peak hour electricity rather than the less expensive average price of electricity modifications to the peak hour pricing policies of utilities such as to a flat rate would require photovoltaic systems to achieve lower prices in order to compete with the price of electricity 

 

we anticipate that our solar modules and their installation will be subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with national and local ordinances relating to building codes safety environmental protection utility interconnection and metering and related matters it is difficult to track the requirements of individual states and design equipment to comply with the varying standards any new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to our solar modules may result in significant additional expenses to us our resellers and their customers and as a result could cause a significant reduction in demand for our solar modules 

 

environmental obligations and liabilities could have a substantial negative impact on our financial condition cash flows and profitability 

 

our operations involve the use handling generation processing storage transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations at the national state local 

and international level these environmental laws and regulations include those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the use management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes the cleanup of contaminated sites and occupational health and safety we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs and capital expenditures in complying with these laws and regulations in addition violations of or liabilities under environmental laws or permits may result in restrictions being imposed on our operating activities or in our being subjected to substantial fines penalties criminal proceedings third party property damage or personal injury claims cleanup costs or other costs while we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements future developments such as more aggressive enforcement policies the implementation of new more stringent laws and regulations or the discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

in addition certain components of our products contain cadmium telluride and cadmium sulfide elemental cadmium and certain of its compounds are regulated as hazardous due to the adverse health effects that may arise from human exposure although the risks of exposure to cadmium telluride are not believed to be as serious as those relating to the exposure of elemental cadmium the chemical physical and toxicological properties of cadmium telluride have not been thoroughly investigated and reported we maintain engineering controls to minimize employee exposure to cadmium and require our employees who handle cadmium compounds to follow certain safety procedures including the use of personal protective equipment such as respirators chemical goggles and protective clothing in addition we believe the risk of exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds from our endproducts is limited by the fully encapsulated nature of these materials in our products as well as the implementation in 2005 of our end of life recycling program for our solar modules while we believe that these factors and procedures are sufficient to protect our employees endusers and the general public from cadmium exposure we cannot assure you that human or environmental exposure to cadmium or cadmium compounds used in our products will not occur any such exposure could result in future thirdparty claims against us as well as damage to our reputation and heightened regulatory scrutiny of our products which could limit or impair our ability to sell and distribute our products the occurrence of future events such as these could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

the use of cadmium in various products is also coming under increasingly stringent governmental regulation future regulation in this area could impact the manufacture and sale of cadmiumcontaining solar modules and could require us to make unforeseen environmental expenditures or to limit our ability to sell and distribute our products for example the european union directive 200296ec on waste electrical and electronic equipment the “weee directive” requires manufacturers of certain electrical and electronic equipment to be financially responsible for the collection recycling treatment and disposal of specified products placed on the market in the european union in addition european union directive 200295ec on the restriction of the use of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment the “rohs directive” restricts the use of certain hazardous substances including cadmium in specified products other jurisdictions are considering adopting similar legislation currently photovoltaic solar modules in general are not subject to the weee or rohs directives however these directives allow for future amendments subjecting additional products to their requirements and the scope applicability and the products included in the weee and rohs directives are currently being considered and may change if in the future our solar modules become subject to requirements such as these we may be required to apply for an exemption if we were unable to obtain an exemption we would be required to redesign our solar modules in order to continue to offer them for sale within the european union which would be impractical failure to comply with these directives could result in the imposition of fines and penalties the inability to sell our solar modules in the european union competitive disadvantages and loss of net sales all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we have limited insurance coverage and may incur losses resulting from product liability claims business interruptions or natural disasters 

 

we are exposed to risks associated with product liability claims in the event that the use of our solar modules results in personal injury or property damage our solar modules are electricityproducing devices and it is possible that users could be injured or killed by our solar modules due to product malfunctions defects improper installation or other causes we commenced commercial shipment of our solar modules in 2002 and due to our limited historical 

experience we are unable to predict whether product liability claims will be brought against us in the future or the effect of any resulting adverse publicity on our business moreover we may not have adequate resources and insurance to satisfy a judgment in the event of a successful claim against us the successful assertion of product liability claims against us could result in potentially significant monetary damages and require us to make significant payments any business disruption or natural disaster could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources 

 

the estate of john t walton and its affiliates control us and their interests may conflict with or differ from your interests as a stockholder 

 

our current majority stockholder the estate of john t walton and its affiliates including jcl holdings llc beneficially owns a majority of our outstanding common stock the estate of john t walton and its affiliates have substantial influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval including the election of our directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions such as mergers tender offers and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets in addition our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that unless and until the estate of john t walton jcl holdings llc john t walton’s surviving spouse descendants any entity including a trust that is for the benefit of john t walton’s surviving spouse or descendants or any entity including a trust over which any of john t walton’s surviving spouse descendants or siblings has voting or dispositive power collectively the “estate” collectively owns less than 40 of our common stock then outstanding stockholders holding 40 or more of our common stock then outstanding may call a special meeting of the stockholders at which our stockholders could replace our board of directors in addition unless and until the estate collectively owns less than 40 of our common stock then outstanding stockholder action may be taken by written consent the interests of the estate could conflict with or differ from your interests as a holder of our common stock for example the concentration of ownership held by the estate could delay defer or prevent a change of control of our company or impede a merger takeover or other business combination which you may view favorably 

 

we are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the nasd rules and as a result qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements 

 

the estate of john t walton and its affiliates control a majority of our outstanding common stock under the nasd rules a company of which more than 50 of the voting power is held by an individual group or another company is a “controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements including the following 

 

  

with the appointment of mr sohn as president of the company he is no longer considered an independent director and accordingly we no longer have a majority of our board consisting of independent directors other than the current composition of the board pending our search for additional independent directors we do not presently intend to use these exemptions however we could decide to use one or more of these exceptions in the future if we decide to use any of these exceptions you would not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of these corporate governance requirements 

 

if our stock price fluctuates you could lose a significant part of your investment 

 

the market price of our stock may be influenced by many factors some of which are beyond our control including those described above and the following 

 

  

as a result of these factors investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above the price they paid for the common stock these broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance 

 

shares eligible for future sale may cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly even if our business is doing well 

 

the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market or the perception that these sales could occur these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate 

 

we are incurring and will continue to incur costs as a result of being a public company that we did not incur when we were a private company 

 

as a newly public company we are incurring and will continue to incur significant legal accounting and other expenses that we did not incur when we were a private company in addition the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 as well as rules subsequently implemented by the sec and the nasdaq global market have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies we expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more timeconsuming and costly in addition we will incur additional costs associated with our public company reporting requirements we also expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage as a result it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or as executive officers we are currently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to these rules and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs 

 

we identified several significant deficiencies in our internal controls that were deemed to be material weaknesses if we are unable to successfully address the material weaknesses in our internal controls our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected 

 

in connection with the audit of our financial statements for the years ended december 25 2004 and december 31 2005 we identified several significant deficiencies in our internal controls that were deemed to be “material weaknesses” in our internal controls as defined in standards established by the public company accounting oversight board “pcaob” see item 9a — “controls and procedures” in this annual report on form 10k 

 

a material weakness is defined by the pcaob as a significant deficiency or combination of significant deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected 

 

as of december 31 2005 we did not maintain effective controls over the preparation review and presentation and disclosure of our consolidated financial statements due to a lack of personnel with experience in financial reporting and control procedures necessary for sec registrants this failure caused several significant deficiencies four of which had a large enough impact on our operating results to individually constitute material weaknesses these material weaknesses were i we did not maintain effective controls to ensure that the appropriate labor and overhead expenses were included in the cost of our inventory and that intercompany profits in inventory were completely and accurately eliminated as part of the consolidation process ii we did not maintain effective controls to ensure the complete and accurate capitalization of interest in connection with our property plant and equipment additions iii we did not maintain effective controls to properly accrue for warranty obligations and iv we did not maintain effective controls to properly record the formation of first solar us manufacturing llc in 1999 and the subsequent liquidation of minority membership units in 2003 

 

these control deficiencies resulted in the restatement of our consolidated financial statements for 2004 and audit adjustments to our 2005 consolidated financial statements and to the consolidated financial statements of each interim period in 2005 these control deficiencies could result in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement to our annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected accordingly we have concluded that each of these control deficiencies constitutes a material weakness 

 

we are in the process of adopting and implementing several measures to improve our internal controls if the remedial procedures we have adopted and implemented are insufficient to address our material weakness and significant deficiencies we may fail to meet our future reporting obligations our financial statements may contain material misstatements and our operating results may be adversely affected 

 

we cannot assure you that additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls or difficulties we encounter in their implementation could result in additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses cause us to fail to meet our future reporting obligations or cause our financial statements to contain material misstatements any such failure could also adversely affect the results of the periodic management evaluations and annual auditor attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that are required under section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and which will become applicable to us beginning with the required filing of our annual report on form 10k for fiscal 2007 in the first quarter of 2008 internal control deficiencies could also result in a restatement of our financial statements in the future or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information leading to a decline in our stock price 

 

failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 

 

as a public company we are required to document and test our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act which will require annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm that both addresses management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting during the course of our testing we may identify deficiencies which we may not be able to remediate in time to meet our deadline for compliance with section 404 testing and maintaining internal controls can divert our management’s attention from other matters that are important to our business we also expect the new regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance cost make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified officers and members of our board of directors particularly to serve on our audit committee and make some activities more difficult time consuming and costly we may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section 404 or our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able or willing to issue an unqualified report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting if we 

conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective we cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation testing and remediation actions or their effect on our operations since there is presently no precedent available by which to measure compliance adequacy if either we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting or our independent auditors are unable to provide us with an unqualified report as required by section 404 then investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock see item 1a risk factors — “we identified several significant deficiencies in our internal controls that were deemed to be material weaknesses if we are unable to successfully address the material weaknesses in our internal controls our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected”

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k in addition to historical consolidated financial information the following discussion and analysis contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks uncertainties and assumptions as described under the “note regarding forwardlooking statements” that appears earlier in this annual report on form 10k our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by these forwardlooking statements as a result of many factors including those discussed under “item 1a risk factors” and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

 

overview 

 

we design and manufacture solar modules using a proprietary thin film semiconductor technology that has allowed us to reduce our average solar module manufacturing costs to among the lowest in the world each solar module uses a thin layer of cadmium telluride semiconductor material to convert sunlight into electricity we manufacture our solar modules on a highthroughput production line and we perform all manufacturing steps ourselves in an automated continuous process in 2006 we sold almost all of our solar modules to solar project developers and system integrators headquartered in germany 

 

currently we manufacture our solar modules and conduct our research and development activities at our perrysburg ohio manufacturing facility we completed the qualification of our base plant in perrysburg for high volume production in november 2004 during 2005 the first full year our base plant operated at high volume production we reduced our average manufacturing cost per watt to 159 from 294 in 2004 our average manufacturing cost per watt decreased further to 140 in 2006 we define average manufacturing cost per watt as the total manufacturing cost incurred during the period including stockbased compensation expense relating to our adoption of sfas 123r divided by the total watts produced during the period by continuing to expand globally production and improve our technology and manufacturing process we believe that we can further reduce our manufacturing costs per watt our objective is to become by 2010 the first solar module manufacturer to offer a solar electricity solution that competes on a nonsubsidized basis with the price of retail electricity in key markets in the united states europe and asia to approach the price of retail electricity in such markets we believe that we will need to reduce our manufacturing costs per watt by an additional 4050 assuming prices for traditional energy sources remain flat on an inflation adjusted basis 

 

first solar was founded in 1999 to bring an advanced thin film semiconductor process into commercial production through the acquisition of predecessor technologies and the initiation of a research development and production program that allowed us to improve upon the predecessor technologies and launch commercial operations in january 2002 from january 2002 to the end of 2005 we sold approximately 28mw of solar modules during 2006 we sold approximately 56mw of solar modules 

 

we converted on february 22 2006 from a delaware limited liability company to a delaware corporation prior that date we operated as a delaware limited liability company 

 

our fiscal year ends on the saturday on or before december 31 all references to fiscal year 2006 relate to the 52 weeks ended december 30 2006 all references to fiscal year 2005 relate to the 53 weeks ended december 31 2005 and all references to fiscal year 2004 relate to the 52 weeks ended december 25 2004 we use a 13 week fiscal quarter 

 

manufacturing capacity 

 

we commenced low volume commercial production of solar modules with our pilot production line in perrysburg ohio in january 2002 during 2003 and 2004 while continuing to sell solar modules manufactured on our pilot line we designed the base plant a replicable highthroughput production line we ultimately merged most of the equipment from the pilot line into the base plant completing the qualification of the base plant for full volume production in november 2004 the base plant has an expected annual capacity of 25mw in february 2005 we commenced construction of two additional 25mw production lines at our perrysburg ohio facility which we refer to as our ohio expansion we completed the qualification of the ohio expansion for full volume production in august 2006 during the construction of the ohio expansion we improved certain aspects of the base plant including the building design and layout and the design and manufacture of certain production equipment our twoline ohio expansion represents a “standard building block” for building future production facilities or expansions of our existing production facilities 

 

in february 2006 we commenced construction of our german plant a new manufacturing facility located in frankfurt oder in the state of brandenburg germany that will house four 25mw production lines for a total of 100 mw name plate capacity we anticipate completing the qualification of the german plant for full volume production during the second half of 2007 on january 24 2007 we entered into a lease for a site in the kulim hitech park in kadah state malaysia where we plan to start construction of a four line 100mw plant in the second quarter of 2007 

 

the following table summarizes our current and inprocess production capacity 

 

 

 

 

  

each production line currently has an annual production capacity of 400000 solar modules representing 25mw we anticipate that we will be able to increase both the run rate and mw volume of our existing production lines through our continuous improvement program for example we increased the average conversion efficiency of our solar modules from approximately 7 in 2003 to approximately 9 at the end of 2006 thereby increasing the number of sellable watts per solar module from approximately 49 watts to approximately 64 watts 

 

financial operations overview 

 

the following describes certain line items in our statement of operations and some of the factors that affect our operating results 

 

net sales 

 

we generate substantially all of our net sales from the sale of solar modules over the past three years the main constraint limiting our sales has been production capacity as customer demand has exceeded the number of solar modules we could produce we price and sell our solar modules per watt of power for example our average sales price was 239 per watt during the 2006 as a result our net sales can fluctuate based on our output of sellable watts we currently sell almost all of our solar modules to solar project developers and system integrators headquartered in germany which then resell our solar modules to endusers who receive government subsidies our net sales could be negatively impacted if legislation reduces the current subsidy programs in europe the united states or asia or if interest rates increase which could impact our endusers’ ability to either meet their target return on investment or finance their projects 

 

in april 2006 we entered into contracts for the purchase and sale of our solar modules with six european project developers and system integrators we refer to these as our “long term sales contracts” these contracts account for a significant portion of our planned production over the period from 2006 through 2012 and therefore will significantly affect our overall financial performance the initial terms of the long term sales contracts allowed us to deliver 795mw of solar modules from 2006 through 2011 which would generate €12 billion 16 billion at an assumed exchange rate of 130€100 of sales over that period based on the contractual pricing 

 

in december 2006 we exercised our option under each of the long term sales contracts to increase the sales volumes that we can deliver starting in 2008 and to extend each contract through 2012 we also amended the long term sales contracts with four of our customers in january 2007 to further increase the sales volumes that we can deliver over the duration of each contract as a result of the option exercises and amendments as of january 9 2007 our long term supply contracts allowed for approximately €23 billion 30 billion at an assumed exchange rate of 130€100 in sales from 2006 to 2012 for the manufacture and sale of a total of 1554mw of solar modules of which 50mw was sold in 2006 

 

our long term supply contracts require us to deliver solar modules each year that in total meet or exceed a specified minimum average number of watts per module for the year we are required to increase the minimum 

average number of watts per module by approximately 5 annually between 2007 and 2009 and then by an additional 3 for modules delivered in 2012 if we are unable to meet the minimum average annual number of watts per module in a given year we will be in breach of the agreements entitling our customers to certain remedies potentially including the right to terminate their long term supply contracts in addition our long term supply contracts specify a sales price per watt that declines by approximately 65 each year through the expiration date of the contract in 2012 because these sales prices under our long term sales contracts are fixed and have the builtin decline each year we cannot pass along any increases in manufacturing costs to our customers although we believe that our total manufacturing costs per watt will decline at the same rate or more rapidly than our prices under the long term sales contracts our failure to achieve our manufacturing cost per watt targets could result in a reduction of our gross margin the annual 65 decline in the sales price under the long term sales contracts will reduce our net sales by approximately 56 each year assuming that rated power of our solar modules remains flat and will impact our cash flow accordingly as a result our gross profit and gross margin could decline if we are unable to reduce our manufacturing cost per watt by at least the same rate as the contractual prices decrease furthermore the sales prices under the long term sales contracts are denominated in euros exposing us to risks from currency exchange rate fluctuations 

 

under the long term sales contracts starting in april 2006 we transfer title and risk of loss to the customer and recognize revenue upon shipment under our customer contracts in effect prior to april 1 2006 we did not transfer title or risk of loss or recognize revenue until the solar modules were received by our customers our customers do not have extended payment terms or rights of return under these contracts 

 

we retain the right to terminate the long term sales contracts upon 12 months notice and the payment of a termination fee if we determine that any of the following material adverse changes have occurred new laws rules or regulations with respect to our production distribution installation or reclamation and recycling program have a substantial adverse impact on our business unanticipated technical or operational issues result in our experiencing widespread persistent quality problems or the inability to achieve stable conversion efficiencies at planned levels or extraordinary events beyond our control substantially increase the cost of our labor materials or utility expenses or significantly reduce our throughput the average termination fee under those agreements was €28 million 36 million at an assumed exchange rate of 130€100 under the initial contracts and is now €38 million 49 million at an assumed exchange rate of 130€100 following our exercise of the option to increase our volume commitments 

 

our customers are entitled to certain remedies in the event of missed deliveries of kilowatt volume these delivery commitments are established through rolling four quarter forecasts to be negotiated with each of the customers and define the specific quantities to be purchased on a quarterly basis and the schedules of the individual shipments to be made to the customers in the case of a late delivery our customers are entitled to a maximum charge of up to 6 of the delinquent revenue if we do not meet our annual minimum volume shipments or the minimum average watt per module our customers also have the right to terminate these contracts on a prospective basis 

 

we estimate that the total sales volume under our long term sales contracts will account for approximately twothirds of our planned production volumes from our base plant in ohio ohio expansion plant and german plant and also some of our planned production from our malaysian plant we spent 701 million in capital expenditures for the ohio expansion we are committing 1500 million for the buildout of our german plant through 2007 and anticipate that the buildout of our malaysian plant will require approximately 1500 million through 2008 

 

the information about our long term supply contracts in the preceding paragraphs is intended to summarize the financial terms of the long term supply contracts and is not intended to provide guidance about our future operating results including revenues or profitability 

 

no single customer accounted for more than 20 of our net sales in 2006 

 

cost of sales 

 

our cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials such as tempered back glass tco coated front glass cadmium telluride eva laminate connector assemblies and laminate edge seal our total material cost per solar 

module has been stable over the past three years even though the cost of tellurium a component of cadmium telluride increased by approximately three times from 2003 to 2006 the increase in the cost of tellurium did not have a significant impact on our total raw material cost per solar module because raw tellurium represents a relatively small portion of our overall material and manufacturing costs historically we have not entered into long term supply contracts with fixed prices for our raw materials in 2006 however we entered into a multiyear tellurium supply contract in order to mitigate potential cost volatility and secure raw material supplies we expect our raw material cost per watt to decrease over the next several years as costs per solar module remain stable and sellable watts per solar module increase 

 

other items contributing to our cost of sales are direct labor and manufacturing overhead such as engineering expense equipment maintenance environmental health and safety quality and production control and procurement cost of sales also includes depreciation of manufacturing plant and equipment and facility related expenses in addition we accrue warranty and end of life reclamation and recycling expenses to our cost of sales 

 

we implemented a program in 2005 to reclaim and recycle our solar modules after their use under our reclamation and recycling program we enter into an agreement with the endusers of the photovoltaic systems that use our solar modules in the agreement we commit at our expense to remove the solar modules from the installation site at the end of their use and transport them to a processing center where the solar module materials and components will be recycled and the owner agrees not to dispose of the solar modules except through our program or another program that we approve the photovoltaic system owner is responsible for disassembling the solar modules and packaging them in containers that we provide at the time we sell a solar module we record an expense in cost of sales equal to the present value of the estimated future end of life obligation we record the accretion expense on this future obligation to selling general and administrative expense 

 

overall we expect our cost of sales per watt to decrease over the next several years due to an increase of sellable watts per solar module an increase in unit output per line geographic diversification and more efficient absorption of fixed costs driven by economies of scale 

 

gross profits are affected by a number of factors including our average selling prices foreign exchange rates our actual manufacturing costs and the effective utilization of our production facilities for example our long term customer contracts specify a sales price per watt that declines 65 each year another factor impacting gross profits is the ramp of production due to a lesser absorption of fixed cost until full production volumes are reached as a result gross profits may vary from quarter to quarter and year to year

research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and personnelrelated costs and the cost of products materials and outside services used in our process and product research and development activities in 2006 we began adding equipment for further process developments and recording the depreciation of such equipment as research and development expense we may also allocate a portion of the annual operating cost of the ohio expansion to research and development expense 

 

we maintain a number of programs and activities to improve our technology in order to enhance the performance of our solar modules and manufacturing processes as of december 30 2006 we had a total of 34 employees working on these research and development activities in addition we maintain active collaborations with the national renewable energy laboratory a division of the department of energy brookhaven national laboratory and several universities we report our research and development expense net of grant funding during the past three years we received grant funding that we applied towards our research and development programs we received 10 million in research and development grants during 2004 and 09 million each during 2005 and 2006 we expect our research and development expense to increase in absolute terms in the future as we increase personnel and research and development activity over time we expect research and development expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as a result of economies of scale 

 

selling general and administrative 

 

selling general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other personnelrelated costs professional fees insurance costs travel expense and other selling expenses we expect these expenses to increase in the near term both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales in order to support the growth of our business as we expand our sales and marketing efforts improve our information processes and systems and implement the financial reporting compliance and other infrastructure required for a public company over time we expect selling general and administrative expense to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as our net sales and our total watts sold increase 

 

production startup 

 

production startup expense consists primarily of salaries and personnelrelated costs and the cost of operating a production line before it has been qualified for full production including the cost of raw materials for solar modules run through the production line during the qualification phase it also includes all expenses related to the selection of a new site and the related legal and regulatory costs and the costs to maintain our plant replication program to the extent we cannot capitalize these expenditures we incurred production startup expenses of 32 million in fiscal year 2005 and 117 million during fiscal year 2006 in connection with the qualification of the ohio expansion and the planning and preparation for operation of the german plant we also expect to incur significant production startup expenses in fiscal year 2007 in connection with the german plant and the malaysian plant in general we expect production startup expenses per production line to be higher when we build an entire new manufacturing facility compared to the addition of a new production line at an existing manufacturing facility primarily due to the additional infrastructure investment required over time we expect production startup expenses to decline as a percentage of net sales and on a cost per watt basis as a result of economies of scale 

 

interest expense 

 

interest expense is associated with various debt financings see — “debt and credit sources” 

 

foreign currency gain loss 

 

foreign currency gain loss consists of gains and losses resulting from holding assets and liabilities and conducting transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currency the us dollar 

 

other income expense 

 

other income expense net consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

 

income taxes 

 

first solar inc a delaware corporation was incorporated on february 22 2006 as a delaware corporation we are subject to federal and state income taxes prior to february 22 2006 we operated as a delaware limited liability company and were not subject to state or federal income taxes as a result the annual historical financial data included in this annual report on form 10k does not reflect what our financial position and results of operations would have been had we been a taxable corporation for a full fiscal year 

 

on december 30 2006 we had nonus net operating loss carryforwards of 64 million which have an unlimited expiration period compared to 34 million on december 31 2005 our ability to use these net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on our ability to generate taxable income in future periods and subject to certain international tax laws 

 

certain of our nonus subsidiaries are subject to income taxes in their foreign jurisdictions we expect the tax consequences of our nonus subsidiaries will become significant as we expand our nonus production capacity 

 

we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for differences between financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities we provide valuation allowances against deferred tax assets when we cannot conclude 

that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized as of december 30 2006 we had net deferred tax assets of 549 million consisting primarily of taxbasis goodwill property plant and equipment economic development funding and sharebased compensation as of december 31 2005 we had a deferred tax asset of 19 million consisting primarily of nonus net operating loss carryforwards we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets because we determined that it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets will not be realized 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

in preparing our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap we make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts of reported assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities in our financial statements and the related notes thereto some of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in the selection of appropriate assumptions for determining these estimates by their nature these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty as a result we cannot assure you that actual results will not differ significantly from estimated results we base our judgments and estimates on our historical experience on our forecasts and on other available information as appropriate our significant accounting policies are further described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

 

our critical accounting policies and estimates which require the most significant management estimates and judgment in determining amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k are as follows 

 

revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery of the product has occurred title and risk of loss has passed to the customer the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured in accordance with this policy we record a trade receivable for the selling price of our product and reduce inventory for the cost of goods sold when delivery occurs in accordance with the terms of the respective sales contracts our only significant revenue generating activity is the sale of our single type of solar module we are able to determine that the criteria for revenue recognition have been met by examining objective data and the only estimates that we generally have to make regarding revenue recognition pertain to the collectibility of the resulting receivable we have not experienced significant variability in our collections because we have historically sold our solar modules primarily to six wellestablished customers 

 

end of life reclamation and recycling at the time of sale we recognize an expense for the estimated fair value of our future obligation for reclaiming and recycling the solar modules that we have sold once they have reached the end of their useful lives we base our estimate of the fair value of our reclamation and recycling obligations on the present value of the expected future cost of reclaiming and recycling the solar modules which includes the cost of packaging the solar module for transport the cost of freight from the solar module’s installation site to a recycling center and the material labor and capital costs of the recycling process and an estimated thirdparty profit margin and return on risk rate for such services we based this estimate on our experience reclaiming and recycling our solar modules and on our expectations about future developments in recycling technologies and processes and about economic conditions at the time the solar modules will be reclaimed and recycled in the periods between the time of our sales and our settlement of the reclamation and recycling obligations we accrete the carrying amount of the associated liability by applying the discount rate used in its initial measurement we charged 09 million and 25 million to cost of sales for the fair value of our reclamation and recycling obligation for solar modules sold during the years ended december 31 2005 and december 30 2006 respectively during both the years ended december 31 2005 and december 30 2006 the accretion expense on our reclamation and recycling obligations was insignificant an increase of 10 or a decrease of 10 in our estimate of the future cost of reclaiming and recycling each solar module would result in a 10 increase or decrease respectively in our annual reclamation and recycling cost accrual a 10 increase in the rate we use to discount the future estimated cost would result in a 9 decrease in our estimated costs and a 10 decrease in the rate would result in a 10 increase in the cost 

 

product warranties we provide a limited warranty to the original purchasers of our solar modules for five years following delivery for defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service conditions we also warrant to the original purchasers of our solar modules that solar modules installed in accordance with agreedupon specifications will produce at least 90 of their initial power output rating during the first 10 years following their installation and at least 80 of their initial power output rating during the following 15 years our warranties may be transferred from the original purchaser of our solar modules to a subsequent purchaser we accrue warranty costs when we recognize sales using amounts estimated based on our historical experience with warranty claims our monitoring of field installation sites and inhouse testing during the year ended december 31 2005 we reduced our estimate of our product warranty liability by 10 million because lower manufacturing costs reduced our estimate of the cost required to replace our solar modules under warranty during the year ended december 30 2006 no further significant adjustment to this estimate was required 

 

stockbased compensation in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas 123r which requires companies to recognize compensation expense for all stockbased payments to employees including grants of employee stock options in their statements of operations based on the fair value of the awards and we adopted sfas 123r during the first quarter of the year ended december 31 2005 using the “modified retrospective” method of transition in march 2005 the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no sab 107 which provides guidance regarding the implementation of sfas 123r in particular sab 107 provides guidance regarding calculating assumptions used in stockbased compensation valuation models the classification of stockbased compensation expense the capitalization of stockbased compensation costs and disclosures in management’s discussion and analysis in filings with the sec 

 

determining the appropriate fairvalue model and calculating the fair value of stockbased awards at the date of grant using the valuation model requires judgment we use the blackscholesmerton valuation formula to estimate the fair value of employee stock options which is consistent with the provisions of sfas no 123r option pricing models including the blackscholesmerton formula require the use of input assumptions including expected volatility expected term expected dividend rate and expected riskfree rate of return because our stock has only recently become publicly traded we do not have a meaningful observable shareprice volatility therefore we estimate our expected volatility based on that of similar publiclytraded companies and expect to continue to do so until such time as we might have adequate historical data from our own traded share price we estimated our options’ expected terms using our best estimate of the period of time from the grant date that we expect the options to remain outstanding if we determine another method to estimate expected volatility or expected term is more reasonable than our current methods or if another method for calculating these input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance the fair value calculated for future stockbased awards could change significantly from those used for past awards even if the critical terms of the awards are similar higher volatility and expected terms result in an increase to stockbased compensation determined at the date of grant the expected dividend rate and expected riskfree rate of return are not as significant to the calculation of fair value 

 

in addition sfas no 123r requires us to develop an estimate of the number of stockbased awards which will be forfeited due to employee turnover quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported stockbased compensation if the actual forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate then an adjustment is made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements during the quarter of the change if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate then an adjustment is made to decrease the estimated forfeiture rate which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements these adjustments affect our cost of sales research and development expenses and selling general and administrative expenses during the year ended december 30 2006 the adjustments to our forfeiture rate estimates reduced our sharebased compensation expense by 06 million adjustments to our forfeiture rate estimates did not have a significant impact on our financial statements for any prior year the expense we recognize in future periods could differ significantly from the current period andor our forecasts due to adjustments in the estimated forfeiture rates 

 

valuation of longlived assets our longlived assets include manufacturing equipment and facilities our business requires significant investment in manufacturing facilities that are technologically advanced but that may become obsolete through changes in our industry or the fluctuations in demand for our solar modules we account for our longlived tangible assets and definitelived intangible assets in accordance with sfas 144 accounting for 

the impairment or disposal of longlived assets as a result we assess longlived assets classified as “held and used” including our property plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances arise that may indicate that the carrying amount of the long lived assets may not be recoverable these events would include significant current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of such losses significant changes in the manner of use of assets and significant negative industry or economic trends we evaluated our longlived assets for impairment during 2006 and did not note any triggering events that the carrying values of these assets are not recoverable 

 

accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with sfas 109 accounting for income taxes we operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions under several legal forms as a result we are subject to the jurisdiction of a number of us and nonus tax authorities and to tax agreements and treaties among these governments our operations in these different jurisdictions are taxed on various bases including income before taxes calculated in accordance with jurisdictional regulations determining our taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the relevant tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions about significant future events including the following the amount timing and character of deductions permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits changes in tax laws regulations agreements and treaties currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the amount of income tax assets liabilities expenses and benefits that we record during any given period 

 

results of operations 

 

the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december 25 2004 december 31 2005 and december 30 2006 

 

 

 

fiscal years ended december 30 2006 and december 31 2005 

 

net sales 

 

 

 

the increase in our net sales was due primarily to a 184 increase in the mw volume of solar modules sold in 2006 compared to 2005 we were able to increase the mw volume of solar modules sold primarily as a result of higher throughput our conversion from a five day to a seven day production week and the full production ramp of our ohio expansion in addition we increased the average number of sellable watts per solar module from approximately 59 watts in 2005 to approximately 63 watts in 2006 the increase in net sales was partially offset by a 

decrease in the average selling price per watt from 243 in 2005 to 239 in 2006 our average selling price was positively impacted by 005 due to a favorable foreign exchange rate between the us dollar and euro strong demand from other customers allowed us to reduce our dependence on our largest customer from 45 of net sales in 2005 to 19 of net sales in 2006 in both periods almost all of our net sales resulted from sales of solar modules to customers headquartered in germany 

 

cost of sales 

 

 

 

direct material expense increased 216 million warranty and end of life costs relating to the reclamation and recycling of our solar modules increased 37 million direct labor expense increased 39 million and sales freight and other costs increased 12 million in each case primarily as a result of higher production volumes during 2006 compared to 2005 in addition manufacturing overhead costs increased by 189 million which was primarily comprised of an increase in salaries and personnel related expenses of 87 million including 33 million stockbased compensation expense resulting from the conversion from a five day to a seven day production week and the overall infrastructure buildout of our ohio expansion an increase in facility related expenses of 43 million and an increase in depreciation expense of 59 million primarily as a result of additional equipment becoming operational at our ohio expansion 

 

gross profit 

 

 

 

gross profit increased by 377 million or 227 from 166 million in 2005 to 542 million in 2006 reflecting an increase in net sales as a percentage of sales gross margin increased 570 basis points from 345 in 2005 to 402 in 2006 representing increased leverage of our fixed cost infrastructure and scalability associated with our ohio expansion which drove a 184 increase in the number of mw sold 

 

research and development 

 

 

 

the increase in research and development expense was primarily the result of a 32 million increase in personnel related expense which included stockbased compensation expense of 23 million in 2006 compared to 06 million for the same period in 2005 due to increased headcount and additional option awards consulting and other expenses also increased by 07 million and grant revenue declined by 01 million in 2006 compared to 2005 

 

selling general and administrative 

 

 

selling general and administrative expense increased primarily as a result of an increase in salaries and personnelrelated expenses of 120 million due to increased headcount and an increase in stockbased compensation from 34 million in 2005 compared to 53 million in 2006 in addition legal and professional service fees increased by 48 million and other expenses increased by 07 million during 2006 primarily resulting from expenses incurred in connection with being a public company 

 

production startup 

 

 

 

in 2006 we incurred 117 million of production startup expenses to qualify our ohio expansion and ramp our german plant including related legal and regulatory costs and increased headcount compared to 32 million of production startup expenses for our ohio expansion during 2005 production start up expenses are primarily attributable to the cost of labor and material to run and qualify the line related facility expenses and management of our replication process 

 

foreign exchange gain loss 

 

 

 

foreign exchange gain increased by 73 million from 2005 to 2006 primarily as a result of favorable currency translation between the us dollar and the euro 

 

interest expense 

 

 

 

interest expense increased by 06 million from 2005 to 2006 primarily as a result of increased borrowings associated with our german plant financing in 2006 we capitalized 33 million of interest expense to construction in progress compared to 04 million in 2005 

 

other income expense net 

 

 

 

the increase in other income of 15 million was primarily due to increased interest income resulting from higher cash balances resulting from our initial public offering in the fourth quarter of 2006 

 

income tax expense 

 

 

 

the increase in income tax expense was the result of a change in corporate form from a llc to a ccorporation profitability in 2006 and continued full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 

 

cumulative effect of change in accounting for sharebased compensation 

 

 

 

the adoption of sfas 123r required a change in the method used to estimate forfeitures of employee stock options and resulted in a onetime cumulative effect of 01 million in the first quarter of 2005 

 

fiscal years ended december 31 2005 and december 25 2004 

 

net sales 

 

 

 

of the increase in our net sales 268 million was due to an increase in the mw volume of solar modules sold from 2004 to 2005 we were able to increase the mw volume of solar modules sold primarily because of increases in production capacity and sellable watts per solar module in november 2004 we completed the qualification of our base plant for full volume production and then operated the base plant at a highthroughput production rate for all of 2005 in addition we increased the average number of sellable watts per solar module from approximately 55 watts in 2004 to approximately 59 watts in 2005 resulting in an increase of 35 million in net sales as a result of strong customer demand and the increased number of sellable watts per solar module we increased the average sales price per watt from 222 in 2004 to 243 in 2005 which increased net sales by 42 million strong demand from our other customers also allowed us to reduce our dependence on our largest customer from 681 of net sales in 2004 to 451 of net sales in 2005 in 2005 996 of our net sales resulted from shipments of solar modules to germany compared to 947 of our net sales in 2004 

 

cost of sales 

 

 

 

the increase in our cost of sales was due primarily to higher raw material costs required to support the higher production volumes from the base plant direct materials increased by 73 million from 2004 to 2005 on a cost per solar module and cost per watt basis raw material costs declined slightly from 2004 to 2005 primarily because of improved manufacturing yields and conversion efficiency in addition direct labor increased by 06 million and manufacturing overhead costs increased by 47 million from 2004 to 2005 this increase was driven by higher engineering expense increased equipment maintenance and infrastructure buildout and stockbased compensation expense manufacturing overhead included 08 million of stockbased compensation expense in 2005 compared to 01 million in 2004 depreciation expense also increased by 14 million from 2004 to 2005 as a result of depreciating the base plant for the entire fiscal year we expensed 15 million less warranty and end of life program expenses in 2005 than in 2004 as a result of corrective actions implemented against production material defects encountered in 2004 and lower overall unit production costs 

 

gross profit loss 

 

 

gross profit increased primarily as a result of increased sales volumes our gross margin improved from a negative 394 in 2004 to a positive 345 in 2005 because of improvements in our average sales price per watt an increase in overall sellable watts due to efficiency gains and the economies of scale we realized from operating the base plant at full volume production through most of 2005 

 

research and development 

 

 

 

the increase in research and development expense was primarily due to an increase of 04 million in our development staffing during 2005 an increase of 05 million due to higher stockbased compensation expense and an increase of 02 million due to an increase in consulting fees offset by a reduction of 01 million in facility expense in addition our grant revenue declined by 01 million in 2005 compared to 2004 research and development expenses included stockbased compensation expense of 06 million and 01 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively 

 

selling general and administrative 

 

 

 

22 million of the increase in our selling general and administrative expenses was the result of increased staffing levels primarily in sales and marketing to support higher sales volumes in germany in addition spending for professional services increased by 10 million travel expenses increased by 04 million and facilities expense increased by 05 million in 2005 compared to 2004 stockbased compensation expense increased by 24 million from 10 million in 2004 to 34 million in 2005 

 

production startup 

 

 

 

the increase in production startup expenses from 09 million in 2004 compared to 32 million in 2005 was due to the buildout of our ohio expansion in 2005 production start up expenses are primarily attributable to the cost of labor and material to run and qualify the line related facility expenses and the management of our replication process 

 

foreign exchange gain loss 

 

 

 

foreign exchange losses increased by 18 million during 2005 as the us dollar strengthened against the euro 

 

interest expense 

 

 

 

interest expense increased due to increased borrowings under various notes totaling 287 million at the end of 2005 compared to 137 million at the end of 2004 in 2005 we capitalized 04 million of interest expense in construction in progress compared to 03 million in 2004 

 

other income expense net 

 

 

 

cumulative effect of change in accounting for sharebased compensation 

 

 

 

the adoption of sfas 123r requires a change in the method used to estimate forfeitures of employee stock options resulting in a onetime cumulative effect of 01 million in the first quarter of 2005 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

historically our principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations borrowings from jwma partners llc jwma and its affiliates borrowings from goldman sachs  co equity contributions from jwma and borrowings from local governments and other sources to fund plant expansions during the year ended december 30 2006 we received 3027 million as the net proceeds from an initial public offering of our common stock and as of december 30 2006 we had 3084 million in cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investments one of our strategies is to expand our manufacturing capacity by building new manufacturing plants and production lines such as the german plant currently under construction and a new manufacturing plant in malaysia we expect that each four line manufacturing facility will require a capital expenditure of approximately 1500 million to complete we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operating activities and government grants and low interest debt financings for our german plant will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures needs for at least the next 12 months however if our financial results or operating plans change from our current assumptions we may not have sufficient resources to support our business plan as a result we may engage in one or more debt or equity financings in the future that would result in increased expenses or dilution to our existing stockholders if we are unable to obtain debt or equity financing on reasonable terms we may be unable to execute our expansion strategy see item 1a risk factors — “our future success depends on our ability to build new manufacturing plants and add production lines in a costeffective manner both of which are subject risks and uncertainties” 

 

cash flows 

 

cash provided used was as follows for the years ended december 25 2004 december 31 2005 and december 30 2006 in thousands 

 

 

 

operating activities 

 

cash used in operating activities was 06 million during 2006 compared to cash provided by operating activities of 50 million during 2005 during 2006 cash received from customers increased by 606 million to 1102 million mainly due to increased accounts receivable resulting from higher revenues this increase was offset by cash paid to suppliers and employees of 1119 million during 2006 mainly due to an increase in inventories to support revenue growth and other costs supporting our global expansion 

 

operating activities provided cash of 50 million during 2005 and used cash of 152 million during 2004 the increase of 202 million in cash provided by operating activities from 2004 to 2005 was primarily a result of an increase in cash received from our customers the cash we received from our customers increased because our net sales increased by 345 million from 2004 to 2005 and our accounts receivable decreased by 33 million during the same period these factors were partially offset by an increase in cash paid to our suppliers and employees as a result of higher production volumes and an increase in inventory 

 

investing activities 

 

cash used in investing activities was 1600 million during 2006 compared to 438 million during 2005 cash used for investing activities during 2006 was composed of 1532 million in capital expenditures for our german plant and the ohio expansion and 68 million in cash placed in restricted accounts to fund our solar module reclamation and recycling program to secure our construction loan for the german plant and to secure an inventory supply contract our cash outlays for the german plant were partially recovered through the receipt of 168 million of economic development funding from various german governmental entities which we classify as a cash flow from financing activities cash used in investing activities during 2005 was composed of 425 million in capital expenditures for our ohio expansion 13 million deposited with an insurance company as part of our solar module reclamation and recycling program and 01 million used for other capital expenditures

primarily the result of a 200 million loan from a related party a 150 million loan from the director of development of the state of ohio and a 167 million cash equity contribution by jwma 

 

cash generated from financing activities was 517 million during 2005 compared to 229 million during 2004 during 2004 cash provided by financing activities was primarily the result of a 50 million loan from the director of development of the state of ohio and a 179 million cash equity contribution by jwma 

 

on october 24 2006 we amended our articles of incorporation to authorize us to issue up to 500000000 shares of common stock at a par value of 0001 and up to 30000000 shares of preferred stock at a par value of 0001 these amended and restated articles of incorporation permit our board of directors to establish the voting powers preferences and other rights of any series of preferred stock that we issue on october 30 2006 our board of directors approved a 485 to 1 stock split of our issued and outstanding common shares which was effective november 1 2006 the par value of our common shares remained 0001 per share and the number of authorized shares of common and preferred stock remained the same all share and per share amounts presented in this annual report on form 10k and the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split 

 

contractual obligations 

 

the following table presents our contractual obligations as of december 30 2006 which consists of legal commitments requiring us to make fixed or determinable cash payments regardless of contractual requirements with the vendor to provide future goods or services we purchase raw materials for inventory services and manufacturing equipment from a variety of vendors during the normal course of business in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help assure adequate supply we enter into agreements with suppliers that either allow us to procure goods and services when we choose or that establish purchase requirements 

 

 

 

 

  

debt and credit sources 

 

on july 27 2006 first solar manufacturing gmbh a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of first solar inc entered into a credit facility agreement with a consortium of banks led by ikb deutsche industriebank ag under which we can draw up to €1020 million 1326 million at an assumed exchange rate of 130€100 to fund costs of constructing and starting up our german plant this credit facility consists of a term loan of up to €530 million 689 million at an assumed exchange rate of 130€100 and a revolving credit facility of €270 million 351 million at an assumed exchange rate of 130€100 the facility also provides for a bridge loan which we can draw against to fund construction costs that we later expect to be reimbursed through funding from the federal republic of germany under the investment grant act of 2005 “investitionszulagen”  of up to €220 million 286 million at an assumed exchange rate of 130€100 we can make drawdowns against the term loan and the bridge loan until december 30 2007 and we can make drawdowns against the revolving credit facility until 

september 30 2012 we have incurred costs related to the credit facility totaling 20 million as of december 30 2006 which we will recognize as interest and other financing expenses over the time that borrowings are outstanding under the credit facility we also pay an annual commitment fee of 06 of any amounts not drawn down on the credit facility at december 30 2006 we had outstanding borrowings of 452 million under the term loan which we classify as longterm debt and 163 million under the bridge loan which we classify as shortterm debt we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at december 30 2006 

 

we must repay the term loan in twenty quarterly payments beginning on march 31 2008 and ending on december 30 2012 we must repay the bridge loan with any funding we receive from the federal republic of germany under the investment grant act of 2005 but in any event the bridge loan must be paid in full by december 30 2008 once repaid we may not draw again against term loan or bridge loan facilities the revolving credit facility expires on and must be completely repaid by december 30 2012 in certain circumstances we must also use proceeds from fixed asset sales or insurance claims to make additional principal payments and during 2009 we will also be required to make a onetime principal repayment equal to 20 of any “surplus cash flow” of first solar manufacturing gmbh during 2008 surplus cash flow is a term defined in the credit facility agreement that is approximately equal to cash flow from operating activities less required payments on indebtedness 

 

we pay interest at the annual rate of the euro interbank offered rate euribor plus 16 on the term loan euribor plus 20 on the bridge loan and euribor plus 18 on the revolving credit facility each time we make a draw against the term loan or the bridge loan we may choose to pay interest on that drawdown every three or six months each time we make a draw against the revolving credit facility we may choose to pay interest on that drawdown every one three or six months the credit facility requires us to mitigate our interest rate risk on the term loan by entering into payfixed receivefloating interest rate swaps covering at least 75 of the balance outstanding under the term loan 

 

the federal republic of germany is guaranteeing 48 of our combined borrowings on the term loan and revolving credit facility and the state of brandenburg is guaranteeing another 32 we pay an annual fee not to exceed €05 million 07 million at an assumed exchange rate of 130€100 for these guarantees in addition we must maintain a debt service reserve of €30 million 39 million at an assumed exchange rate of 130€100 in a restricted bank account which the lenders may access if we are unable to make required payments on the credit facility substantially all of our assets in germany including the german plant have been pledged as collateral for the credit facility and the government guarantees 

 

the credit facility contains various financial covenants with which we must comply first solar manufacturing gmbh’s cash flow available for debt service must be at least 11 times its required principal and interest payments for all its liabilities and the ratio of its total noncurrent liabilities to earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization may not exceed 301 from january 1 2008 through december 31 2008 251 from january 1 2009 through december 31 2009 and 151 from january 1 2010 through the remaining term of the credit facility 

 

the credit facility also contains various nonfinancial covenants with which we must comply we must submit various financial reports financial calculations and statistics operating statistics and financial and business forecasts to the lender we must adequately insure our german operation and we may not change the type or scope of its business operations first solar manufacturing gmbh must maintain adequate accounting and information technology systems also first solar manufacturing gmbh cannot open any bank accounts other than those required by the credit facility enter into any financial liabilities other than intercompany obligations or those liabilities required by the credit facility sell any assets to third parties outside the normal course of business make any loans or guarantees to third parties or allow any of its assets to be encumbered to the benefit of third parties without the consent of the lenders and government guarantors 

 

our ability to withdraw cash from first solar manufacturing gmbh for use in other parts of our business is restricted while we have outstanding obligations under the credit facility and associated government guarantees first solar manufacturing gmbh’s cash flows from operations must generally be used for the payment of loan interest fees and principal before any remainder can be used to pay intercompany charges loans or dividends furthermore first solar manufacturing gmbh generally cannot make any payments to affiliates if doing so would cause its cash flow available for debt service to fall below 13 times its required principal and interest payments for all its liabilities for any one year period or cause the amount of its equity to fall below 30 of the amount of its total 

assets first solar manufacturing gmbh also cannot pay commissions of greater than 2 to first solar affiliates that sell or distribute its products also we may be required under certain circumstances to contribute more funds to first solar manufacturing gmbh such as if projectrelated costs exceed our plan we do not recover the expected amounts from governmental investment subsidies or all or part of the government guarantees are withdrawn if there is a decline in the value of the assets pledged as collateral for the credit facility we may also be required to pledge additional assets as collateral 

 

on july 26 2006 we were approved to receive taxable investment incentives “investitionszuschüsse” of approximately €215 million 280 million at an assumed exchange rate of 130€100 from the state of brandenburg germany these funds will reimburse us for certain costs we will incur building our plant in frankfurt oder germany including costs for the construction of buildings and the purchase of machinery and equipment receipt of these incentives is conditional upon the state of brandenburg germany having sufficient funds allocated to this program to pay the reimbursements we claim in addition we are required to operate our facility for a minimum of five years and employ a specified number of employees during this period our incentive approval expires on december 31 2009 as of december 30 2006 we had received 168 million under this program and we had accrued an additional 40 million that we are eligible to receive under this program based on qualifying expenditures that we had incurred through that date 

 

we are eligible to recover up to approximately €238 million 309 million at an assumed exchange rate of 130€100 of expenditures related to the construction of our plant in frankfurt oder germany under the german investment grant act of 2005 “investitionszulagen” this act permits us to claim taxexempt reimbursements for certain costs we will incur building our plant in frankfurt oder germany including costs for the construction of buildings and the purchase of machinery and equipment tangible assets subsidized under this program have to remain in the region for at least 5 years in accordance with the administrative requirements of the act we plan to claim reimbursement under the act in conjunction with the filing of our tax returns with the local german tax office therefore we do not expect to receive funding from this program until we file our annual tax return for fiscal 2006 in 2007 in addition this program expired on december 31 2006 and we can only claim reimbursement for investments completed by this date the majority of our buildings and structures and our investment in machinery and equipment were completed by this date as of december 30 2006 we had accrued 235 million that we are eligible to receive under this program based on qualifying expenditures that we had incurred through that date 

 

during july 2006 we entered into a loan agreement which we amended and restated on august 7 2006 with the estate of john t walton under which we could draw up to 340 million interest was payable monthly at the annual rate of the commercial prime lending rate principal was to be repaid at the earlier of january 2008 or the completion of an initial public offering of our stock this loan did not have any collateral requirements as a condition of obtaining this loan we were required to use a portion of the proceeds to repay the principal of our loan from kingston properties llc a related party during july 2006 we drew 260 million against this loan 87 million of which we used to repay the kingston properties llc loan upon completion of our initial public offering in november 2006 we repaid the entire 260 million loan balance

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

foreign exchange risk 

 

our international operations accounted for approximately 950 of our net sales in 2006 and 996 of our net sales in 2005 in 2006 and 2005 all of our international sales were denominated in euro as a result we have exposure to foreign exchange risk with respect to almost all of our net sales fluctuations in exchange rates particularly in the us dollar to euro exchange rate affect our gross and net profit margins and could result in foreign exchange and operating losses our exposure to foreign exchange risk primarily relates to currency gains and losses from the time we sign and settle our sales contracts for example we recently entered into our long term supply contracts these contracts obligate us to deliver solar modules at a fixed price in euros per watt and do not adjust for fluctuations in the us dollar to euro exchange rate in 2006 a 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates would have impacted our net sales by 131 million 

 

in the past exchange rate fluctuations have had an impact on our business and results of operations for example exchange rate fluctuations positively impacted our cash flows by 04 million in 2005 and 2006 although we cannot predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our business or results of operations we believe that we may have increased risk associated with currency fluctuations in the future as of december 30 2006 we did not engage in hedging activities however our expenditures denominated in euro are increasing due to the construction of our german plant and capital equipment purchases from german suppliers most of the german plant’s operating expenses will be in euro creating increasing opportunities for some natural hedge against the currency risk in our net sales in addition we may decide to enter into other hedging activities in the future 

 

interest rate risk 

 

we are exposed to interest rate risk because many of our endusers depend on debt financing to purchase and install a photovoltaic system although the useful life of a photovoltaic system is approximately 25 years endusers of our solar modules must pay the entire cost of the photovoltaic system at the time of installation as a result many of our endusers rely on debt financing to fund their upfront capital expenditure and final project an increase in interest rates could make it difficult for our endusers to secure the financing necessary to purchase and install a photovoltaic system on favorable terms or at all and thus lower demand for our solar modules and reduce our net sales in addition we believe that a significant percentage of our endusers install photovoltaic systems as an investment funding the initial capital expenditure through a combination of equity and debt an increase in interest rates could lower an investor’s return on investment in a photovoltaic system or make alternative investments more attractive relative to photovoltaic systems which in each case could cause these endusers to seek alternative investments that promise higher returns 

 

during july 2006 we entered into the ikb credit facility which bears interest at euribor plus 16 for the term loan euribor plus 20 for the bridge loan and euribor plus 18 for the revolving credit facility 

 

we entered into three interest rate swap agreements to convert the variable interest on the ikb term loan of euribor plus 16 to fixed interest rates at december 30 2006 the notional value of our interest rate swaps were €288 million 374 million at an assumed exchange rate of 130€100 

 

commodity risk 

 

we are exposed to price risks associated with raw material purchases most significantly tellurium currently we purchase all of our cadmium telluride in manufactured form from two qualified manufacturers but we plan to qualify additional manufacturers we have a three year written contract with our qualified supplier which provides for quarterly price adjustments based on the cost of tellurium as other suppliers become qualified we will purchase cadmium telluride from our other qualified supplier under quarterly purchase orders in 2006 we entered into a multiyear tellurium supply contract in order to mitigate potential cost volatility and secure raw material supplies we acquire the remainder of our raw materials under quarterly or annual purchase orders at prices based on annual volumes because the sale prices of solar modules in our long term supply contracts do not adjust for raw material price increases and are generally for a longer term than our supply contracts we may be unable to pass on increases in the cost of our raw materials to our customers 

 

in addition most of our key raw materials are either solesourced or sourced by a limited number of thirdparty suppliers as a result the failure of any of our suppliers to perform could disrupt our supply chain and impair our operations if our existing suppliers fail to perform we will be required to identify and qualify new suppliers a process that can take between one and twelve months depending on the raw material we might be unable to identify new suppliers or qualify their products for use on our production line in a timely basis and on commercially reasonable terms

 item 9a controls and procedures tableend  

we maintain “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in rule 13a15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 the “exchange act” that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in securities and exchange commission rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met additionally in designing disclosure controls and procedures our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures the design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its started goals under all potential future conditions we believe that our disclosure controls and procedures provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed under the securities and exchange act are recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission rules and forms based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on form 10k and subject to the foregoing our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective 

 

during the period when we became an sec registrant in november 2006 through december 30 2006 there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting this annual report does not include a report of management’s assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting or an attestation report of the company’s independent registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by rules of the securities and exchange commission for newly public companies 

 

we have previously restated our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 25 2004 in order to correct errors that we identified during the preparation of our registration statement in connection with our initial public offering and the performance of the associated audits for the years ended december 25 2004 and december 31 2005 we identified several significant deficiencies in our internal controls that were deemed to be “material weaknesses” in our internal controls as defined in standards established by the public company accounting oversight board “pcaob” a “material weakness” is defined by the pcaob as a significant deficiency or combination of significant deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected a “significant deficiency” is a control deficiency or combination of control deficiencies that adversely affects the company’s ability to initiate authorize record process or report external financial data reliably in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles such that there is more than a remote likelihood that a misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements that is more than inconsequential will not be prevented or detected a “control deficiency” exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis 

 

as of december 31 2005 we did not maintain effective controls over the preparation review and presentation and disclosure of our consolidated financial statements due to a lack of personnel with experience in financial reporting and control procedures necessary for sec registrants this failure caused several significant deficiencies four of which had a large enough impact on our operating results to individually constitute material weaknesses these material weaknesses were i we did not maintain effective controls to ensure that the appropriate labor and overhead expenses were included in the cost of our inventory and that intercompany profits in inventory were completely and accurately eliminated as part of the consolidation process ii we did not maintain effective controls 

to ensure the complete and accurate capitalization of interest in connection with our property plant and equipment additions iii we did not maintain effective controls to properly accrue for warranty obligations and iv we did not maintain effective controls to properly record the formation of first solar us manufacturing llc in 1999 and the subsequent liquidation of minority membership units in 2003 these control deficiencies led to the restatement of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 25 2004 resulting in a 20 million increase in our net loss for the year ended december 25 2004 these control deficiencies also led to audit adjustments to our 2005 consolidated financial statements and to the consolidated financial statements of each interim period in 2005 these control deficiencies could result in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement to our annual or interim financial statements would not be prevented or detected accordingly we have concluded that each of these control deficiencies constitutes a material weaknesses 

 

during fiscal 2006 we designed and placed in operation new controls that remediated the material weakness specifically in the first half of fiscal 2006 we hired a new chief financial officer and created an audit committee comprised entirely of three independent directors and appointed a new independent director to be the chairman of the audit committee furthermore we adopted and implemented additional policies and procedures to strengthen our financial reporting capability including investments into further enhancements of our enterprise resource planning system in the second half of fiscal 2006 we hired additional personnel to strengthen the controls put in place during the first half of fiscal 2006 these personnel included a director of internal audit director accounting director financial planning  analysis and a vice president of tax and trade as well as several analyst positions however the process of designing and implementing an effective financial reporting system is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and the economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant resources to maintain a financial reporting system that is adequate to satisfy our reporting obligations see item 1a risk factors — “we identified several significant deficiencies in our internal controls that were deemed to be material weaknesses if we are unable to successfully address the material weaknesses in our internal controls our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected”
