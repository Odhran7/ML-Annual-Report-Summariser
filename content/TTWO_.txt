while we have developed and continue to develop plans to help mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on our business these efforts may not be effective and a protracted economic downturn may limit the effectiveness of our mitigation efforts any of these considerations described above could cause or contribute to the risks described elsewhere herein and could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or stock price additionally while we have seen increased demand for our products due to stayathome orders the curtailment of certain other forms of entertainment and other pandemicrelated factors that make consumers more inclined to spend time at home benefiting our financial results and operating metrics the trends in fiscal year 2021 with respect to our revenues net income and other financial results and operating metrics may not be indicative of results for future periods particularly if these pandemicrelated factors become less significant as expected during fiscal year 2022 we experienced a moderation in engagement from the alltime highs experienced in fiscal year 2021 but overall engagement continued to be notably higher than it was prepandemic 

the interactive entertainment software industry is highly competitive 

we compete for both licenses to properties and the sale of interactive entertainment software with sony and microsoft each of which is a large developer and marketer of software for its own platforms we also compete with game publishers such as activision blizzard inc electronic arts inc ubisoft entertainment sa and embracer group ab in addition the gaming technologyinternet and entertainment industries have converged in recent years and larger wellfunded technology companies are pursuing and strengthening their interactive entertainment capabilities as evidenced for example by microsofts pending acquisition of activision blizzard as our business is dependent upon our ability to develop hit titles which require increasing budgets for development and marketing the availability of significant financial resources has become a major competitive factor in developing and marketing software games some of our competitors have greater financial technical personnel and other resources than we do and are able to finance larger budgets for development and marketing and make higher offers to licensors and developers for commercially desirable properties our titles also compete with other forms of entertainment such as social media and casual games in addition to motion pictures television and audio and video products featuring similar themes online computer programs and other entertainment which may be less expensive or provide other advantages to consumers 

a number of software publishers who compete with us have developed and commercialized or are currently developing online games as technological advances significantly increase the availability of online games and as consumer acceptance of online gaming grows substantially it could result in a decline in our platformbased software sales and negatively affect sales of such products 

additionally we compete with other forms of entertainment and leisure activities while we monitor general market conditions significant shifts in consumer demand that could materially alter public preferences for different forms of entertainment and leisure activities are difficult to predict failure to adequately identify and adapt to these competitive pressures could have a negative impact on our business 

the inability of our products to achieve significant market acceptance delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of our products may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

new products may not achieve significant market acceptance generate sufficient sales or be introduced in a timely manner to permit us to recover development manufacturing and marketing costs associated with these products these products or enhancements may not be wellreceived by consumers even if wellreviewed and of high quality the life cycle of a title generally involves a relatively high level of sales during the first few months after introduction followed by a rapid decline in sales because sales associated with an initial product launch generally constitute a high percentage of the total sales associated 

with the life of a product delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of one or more new products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results and therefore cause our operating results to be materially different from our expectations 

we are subject to product development risks which could result in delays and additional costs and we must adapt to changes in software technologies 

we depend on our internal development studios and thirdparty software developers to develop new interactive entertainment software within anticipated release schedules and cost projections the development cycle for new titles generally ranges from 12 months for annual sports releases to multiple years for certain of our topselling titles therefore our development costs can be substantial if we or our thirdparty developers experience unanticipated development delays financial difficulties or additional costs for example as a result of covid19 we may not be able to release titles according to our schedule and at budgeted costs there can be no assurance that our products will be sufficiently successful so that we can recoup these costs or make a profit on these products 

additionally in order to stay competitive our internal development studios must anticipate and adapt to rapid technological changes affecting software development such as cloudbased game streaming and evolving business models such as freetoplay and subscriptionbased access to a portfolio of interactive content to stay competitive rapid changes in our industry require us to anticipate sometimes years in advance the ways in which our products and services will be competitive in the market we have invested and in the future may invest in new business and marketing strategies technologies distribution methods products and services there can be no assurance that these strategic investments will achieve expected returns any inability to respond to technological advances and implement new technologies could render our products obsolete or less marketable further the failure to pursue the development of new technology platforms or business models that obtain meaningful commercial success in a timely manner may negatively affect our business resulting in increased production or development costs and more strenuous competition 

our reputation and brand could also be adversely affected we also may miss opportunities or fail to respond quickly enough to adopt technology or distribution methods or develop products services or new ways to engage with our games that become popular with consumers which could adversely affect our financial results in either case our products and services may be technologically inferior to those of our competitors less appealing to consumers or both 

increased competition for limited shelf space and promotional support from retailers could affect the success of our business and require us to incur greater expenses to market our titles 

while digital sales are increasingly important to our business for physical sales retailers have limited shelf space and promotional resources competition is intense among newly introduced interactive entertainment software titles for adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support with most and highest quality shelf space devoted to those products expected to be best sellers we cannot be certain that our new products will consistently achieve best seller status competition for retail shelf space is expected to continue to increase which may require us to increase our marketing expenditures to maintain desirable sales levels of our titles competitors with more extensive lines and more popular titles may have greater bargaining power with retailers accordingly we may not be able or we may have to pay more than our competitors to achieve similar levels of promotional support and shelf space similarly as digital sales increase in importance to our business there is increasing competition for premium placements of products on websites such placement is subject to many similar risks as physical shelf space discussed above 

the increasing importance of digital sales exposes us to the risks of that business model including greater competition 

the proportion of our revenues derived from digital content delivery as compared to traditional retail sales may continue to increase the increased importance of digital content delivery in our industry including through subscriptionbased access to a portfolio of interactive content increases our potential competition as the minimum capital needed to produce and publish a digitally delivered game is significantly less than that needed to produce and publish one that is delivered through retail distribution this shift also requires us to dedicate capital to developing and implementing alternative marketing strategies which may not be successful if either occurs we may be unable to effectively market and distribute our products which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results in addition a continuing shift to digital delivery could result in a deprioritization of our products by traditional retailers also while digitally‑distributed products generally have higher profit margins than retail sales as business shifts to digital distribution the volume of orders from retailers for physical discs has been and is expected to be reduced 

our business is subject to our ability to develop commercially successful products for the current video game platforms 

we derive most of our revenue from the sale of products made for video game platforms manufactured by third parties such as sonys ps4 and ps5 and microsofts xbox one and xbox series xs which comprised 722 of our net revenue by product platform for the fiscal year ended march 31 2022 the success of our business is subject to the continued popularity of these platforms and our ability to develop commercially successful products for these platforms 

in 2020 sony and microsoft each launched their respective next generation consoles historically when next generation consoles are announced or introduced into the market consumers have typically reduced their purchases of products for priorgeneration consoles in anticipation of purchasing a nextgeneration console and products for that console during these periods sales of the products we publish may decline until new platforms achieve wide consumer acceptance console transitions may have a comparable impact on sales of downloadable content amplifying the impact on our revenues this decline may not be offset by increased sales of products for the nextgeneration consoles in addition as console hardware moves through its life cycle hardware manufacturers typically enact price reductions and decreasing prices may put downward pressure on software prices during console transitions we may simultaneously incur costs both in continuing to develop and market new titles for priorgeneration video game platforms which may not sell at premium prices and also in developing products for nextgeneration platforms which may not generate immediate or nearterm revenues as a result our business and operating results may be more volatile and difficult to predict during console transitions than during other times 

we cannot publish our titles without the approval of hardware licensors that are also our competitors 

we are required to obtain licenses from certain of our competitors including sony and microsoft to develop and publish titles for their respective hardware platforms our existing platform licenses require that we obtain approval for the publication of new titles on a titlebytitle basis as a result the number of titles we are able to publish for these hardware platforms our ability to manage the timing of the release of these titles and accordingly our net revenue from titles for these hardware platforms may be limited if a licensor chooses not to renew or extend our license agreement at the end of its current term or if a licensor were to terminate our license for any reason or does not approve one or more of our titles we may be unable to publish that title as well as additional titles for that licensors platform during or following a console transition like the one that occurred in 2020 hardware platform manufacturers may seek to change the terms governing our relationships with them termination of any such agreements or disapproval of titles could seriously hurt our business and prospects we may be unable to continue to enter into license agreements for certain current generation platforms on satisfactory terms or at all failure to enter into any such agreement could also seriously hurt our business 

in addition platform providers such as sony and microsoft control the networks over which consumers purchase digital products and services for their platforms and through which we provide online game capabilities for our products the control that these platform providers have over consumer access to our games the fee structures andor retail pricing for products and services for their platforms and online networks and the terms and conditions under which we do business with them could impact the availability of our products or the volume of purchases of our products made over their networks and our profitability the networks provided by these platform providers are the exclusive means of selling and distributing our content on these platforms if the platform provider establishes terms that restrict our offerings on its platform significantly alters the financial terms on which these products or services are offered or does not approve the inclusion of content on its platform our business could be negatively impacted we also derive significant revenues from distribution on third‑party mobile and web platforms such as the apple app store the google play store and facebook which are also our direct competitors and in some cases the exclusive means through which our content reaches gamers on those platforms and most of the virtual currency we sell is purchased using these platform providers’ payment processing systems if these platforms deny access to our games modify their current discovery mechanisms communication channels available to developers operating systems terms of service or other policies including fees our business could be negatively impacted these platform providers or their services may be unavailable or may not function as intended or may experience issues with their in‑app purchasing functionality 

our business could be adversely affected if our consumer data protection measures are not seen as adequate or there are breaches of our security measures or unintended disclosures of our consumer data 

we are collecting and storing consumer information including personal information we take measures to protect our consumer information from unauthorized access or disclosure it is possible that our security controls over consumer information may not prevent the improper access or disclosure of personal information in addition due to the highprofile nature of our products we may draw a disproportionately higher amount of attention and attempts to breach our security controls than companies with lower profile products a security incident that leads to disclosure of consumer information including personal information could harm our reputation compel us to comply with disparate breach notification laws in various jurisdictions and otherwise subject us to liability under laws that protect personal information any of which could result in increased costs or loss of revenue a resulting perception that our products or services do not adequately protect the privacy of personal information could result in a loss of current or potential consumers and business partners in addition if any of our business partners experience a security incident that leads to disclosure of consumer information our reputation could be harmed resulting in loss of revenue 

in addition certain of our products are online enabled the ability of our products to offer online functionality and our ability to offer content through a video game platforms digital distribution channel is dependent upon the continued operation and security of such platforms online network these thirdparty networks as well as our own internal systems and websites and the related security measures may be breached as a result of thirdparty action including intentional misconduct by computer hackers employee error malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our 

customers information or our data — including our intellectual property and other confidential business information — or our information technology systems because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures further the risk of such a breach may be heightened by world events such as the current conflict between russia and ukraine if an actual or perceived breach of our safeguards occurs we may lose business suffer irreparable damage to our reputation andor incur significant costs and expenses relating to the investigation and possible litigation of claims relating to such event 

security breaches involving the source code for our products or other sensitive and proprietary information could adversely affect our business 

we securely store the source code for our interactive entertainment software products as it is created a breach whether physical electronic or otherwise of the systems on which such source code and other sensitive data are stored could lead to damage or piracy of our software in addition certain parties with whom we do business are given access to our sensitive and proprietary information in order to provide services and support our team these third parties may misappropriate our information and engage in unauthorized use of it a data intrusion into a server for a game with online features or for our proprietary online gaming service could also disrupt the operation of such game or platform further the risk of such a breach may be heightened by world events such as the current conflict between russia and ukraine if we or these third parties are subject to data security breaches we may have a loss in sales or increased costs arising from the restoration or implementation of additional security measures which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results any theft andor unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an event could adversely affect our competitive position reputation brand and future sales of our products our business could be subject to significant disruption and we could suffer monetary and other losses and reputational harm in the event of such incidents and claims 

we depend on our key management and product development personnel 

our continued success will depend to a significant extent on our senior management team and our relationship with zelnickmedia corporation zelnickmedia our executive chairmanchief executive officer and president are partners of zelnickmedia we are also highly dependent on the expertise skills and knowledge of our key creative personnel responsible for content creation and development of our grand theft auto and other hit titles and titles based on other brands we may not be able to continue to retain these personnel at current compensation levels or at all our industry is generally characterized by a high level of employee mobility competitive compensation programs and aggressive recruiting among competitors for employees with technical marketing sales engineering product development creative andor management skills 

the loss of the services of our executive officers zelnickmedia or certain key creative personnel could significantly harm our business in addition if one or more key employees were to join a competitor or form a competing company we may lose additional personnel experience material interruptions in product development delays in bringing products to market and difficulties in our relationships with licensors suppliers and customers which would significantly harm our business failure to continue to attract and retain qualified management and creative personnel could adversely affect our business and prospects 

our results of operations or reputation may be harmed as a result of offensive consumercreated content 

we are subject to risks associated with the collaborative online features in our games which allow consumers to post narrative comments in real time that are visible to other consumers from time to time objectionable and offensive consumer content may be posted to a gaming or other site with online chat features or game forums which allow consumers to post comments we may be subject to lawsuits governmental regulation or restrictions and consumer backlash including decreased sales and harmed reputation as a result of consumers posting offensive content we may also be subject to consumer backlash from comments made in response to postings we make on social media sites such as facebook youtube and twitter if we fail to appropriately respond to the dissemination of such content we may be subject to lawsuits and governmental regulation our players may not engage with our products and services andor may lose confidence in our brands and our financial results may be adversely affected 

our business is partly dependent on our ability to enter into successful software development arrangements with third parties 

our success depends on our ability to continually identify and develop new titles timely we rely on thirdparty software developers for the development of some of our titles quality thirdparty developers are continually in high demand and those who have developed titles for us in the past may not be available to develop software for us in the future due to the limited availability of thirdparty software developers and the limited control that we exercise over them these developers may not be able to complete titles for us on a timely basis or within acceptable quality standards if at all we have entered into agreements with third parties to acquire the rights to publish and distribute interactive entertainment software as well as to use licensed intellectual properties in our titles these agreements typically require us to make development payments pay 

royalties and satisfy other conditions our development payments may not be sufficient to permit developers to develop new software successfully which could result in material delays and significant increases in our costs to bring particular products to market software development costs promotion and marketing expenses and royalties payable to software developers and thirdparty licensors have continued to increase and reduce potential profits derived from sales of our software future sales of our titles may not be sufficient to recover development payments and advances to software developers and licensors and we may not have adequate financial and other resources to satisfy our contractual commitments to such developers if we fail to satisfy our obligations under agreements with thirdparty developers and licensors the agreements may be terminated or modified in ways that are burdensome to us and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

in addition disputes occasionally arise with external developers including with respect to game content launch timing achievement of certain milestones the game development timeline marketing campaigns contractual terms and interpretation if we have disputes with external developers or they cannot meet product development schedules acquire certain approvals or are otherwise unable or unwilling to honor their obligations to us we may delay or cancel previously announced games alter our launch schedule or experience increased costs and expenses which could result in a delay or significant shortfall in anticipated revenue harm our profitability and reputation and cause our financial results to be materially affected 

we rely on a limited number of channel partners some of whom influence the fee structures for online distribution of our games on their platforms 

we rely on a limited number of channel partners some of whom have retained the right to change the fee structures for online distribution of both paid content and free content including patches and corrections that we license to them for distribution on their platforms such channel partners ability to set or influence royalty rates may increase costs which could negatively affect our operating margins we may be unable to distribute our content in a costeffective or profitable manner through such distribution channel which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

outside of fee arrangements our agreements with our channel partners sometimes give them significant control over other aspects of the distribution of our products and services that we develop for their platform if our channel partners establish terms that restrict our offerings through their channels or significantly affect the financial terms on which these products or services are offered to our customers we may be unable to distribute our product offerings through them or be forced to do so on materially worse financial or business terms in negotiating such various aspects of distribution increased competition for digital “shelf space” has put channel partners in more favorable bargaining positions in relation to such terms of distribution 

the increasing importance of freetoplay games to our business exposes us to the risks of that business model including the dependence on a relatively small number of consumers for a significant portion of revenues and profits from any given game 

we are increasingly dependent on our ability to develop enhance and monetize free‑to‑play games  as such we are increasingly exposed to the risks of the free‑to‑play business model for example we may invest in the development of new free‑to‑play interactive entertainment products that do not achieve significant commercial success in which case our revenues from those products likely will be lower than anticipated and we may not recover our development costs further our business may be negatively impacted if 1 we are unable to encourage new and existing consumers to purchase our virtual items 2 we fail to offer monetization features that appeal to these consumers 3 our platform providers make it more difficult or expensive for players to purchase our virtual items 4 we cannot encourage significant additional consumers to purchase virtual items in our game andor 5 our freetoplay releases reduce sales of our other games 

if we acquire or invest in other businesses intellectual properties or other assets we may be unable to integrate them with our business our financial performance may be impaired andor we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for such transactions 

if appropriate opportunities present themselves we may acquire or make investments in businesses intellectual properties and other assets that we believe are strategic we may not be able to identify negotiate or finance any future acquisition or investment successfully even if we do succeed in acquiring or investing in a business intellectual property or other asset such acquisitions and investments involve a number of risks including 

• retaining key employees and maintaining the key business and customer relationships of the businesses we acquire 

• cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from an acquired company or business into our organization 

• the possibility that the combined company would not achieve the expected benefits including any anticipated operating and product synergies of the acquisition as quickly as anticipated or that the costs of or operational difficulties arising from an acquisition would be greater than anticipated 

• the potential for the acquired business to underperform relative to our expectations and the acquisition price 

• unexpected tax consequences from the acquisition or the tax treatment of the acquired businesss operations going forward giving rise to incremental tax liabilities that are difficult to predict 

• significant acquisitionrelated accounting adjustments particularly relating to an acquired companys deferred revenue that may cause reported revenue and profits of the combined company to be lower than the sum of their standalone revenue and profits 

• significant accounting charges resulting from the completion and integration of a sizable acquisition and increased capital expenditures including potential impairment charges incurred to write down the carrying amount of intangible assets generated as a result of an acquisition 

• the possibility that significant acquisitions when not managed cautiously may result in the overextension of our existing operating infrastructures internal controls and information technology systems 

• the possibility that we will not discover important facts during due diligence that could have a material adverse effect on the value of the businesses we acquire including the possibility that a change of control of a company we acquire triggers a termination of contractual or intellectual property rights important to the operation of its business 

• the need to integrate an acquired companys accounting management information human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management and timely reporting and the need to implement or remediate controls procedures and policies appropriate for a public company in an acquired company that prior to the acquisition lacked these controls procedures and policies 

• litigation or other claims in connection with or inheritance of claims or litigation risks as a result of an acquisition including claims from terminated employees customers or other third parties and 

• to the extent that we engage in strategic transactions outside of the us we face additional risks including risks related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages currency risks and the particular economic political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries 

• the need to implement controls procedures and policies appropriate for a larger usbased public company at companies that prior to acquisition may not have as robust controls procedures and policies particularly with respect to the effectiveness of cyber and information security practices and incident response plans compliance with data privacy and protection and other laws and regulations protecting the rights of players and customers and compliance with usbased economic policies and sanctions which may not have previously been applicable to the acquired company’s operations 

further any such transaction may involve the risk that our senior management’s attention will be excessively diverted from our other operations the risk that our industry does not evolve as anticipated and that any intellectual property or personnel skills acquired do not prove to be those needed for our future success and the risk that our strategic objectives cost savings or other anticipated benefits are otherwise not achieved 

future acquisitions and investments could also involve the issuance of our equity and equitylinked securities potentially diluting our existing stockholders the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses writeoffs of goodwill intangibles or acquired inprocess technology or other increased cash and noncash expenses such as stockbased compensation any of the foregoing factors could harm our financial condition or prevent us from achieving improvements in our financial condition and operating performance that could have otherwise been achieved by us on a standalone basis our stockholders may not have the opportunity to review vote on or evaluate future acquisitions or investments 

we face risks from our international operations 

we are subject to certain risks because of our international operations particularly as we continue to grow our business and presence in asia latin america and other parts of the world changes to and compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations may increase our cost of doing business and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals could harm our international and domestic sales in either the us or other countries trade legislation such as a change in the current tariff structures importexport compliance laws a change in the relationship between either us or the us and any country in which we have significant operations or sales or other trade laws or policies could adversely affect our ability to sell or to distribute in international markets additionally cultural differences may affect consumer preferences and as a result some of our hit products may not sell as well as they do in the us cultural differences may also require us to modify the content of our products or the method by which we charge our customers if we do not correctly assess consumer preferences in the countries in which we sell our products or respond to other risks related to our international operations it could negatively affect our business 

our business may also be affected directly or indirectly by major world events such as the conflict between russia and ukraine such events could decrease the demand for our products and services make it difficult or impossible for us to 

deliver products and services to certain of our customers or result in restrictions in trade all of which could negatively affect our business 

further the enforcement of regulations relating to mobile and other games with an online element in china remains uncertain and further changes either in the regulation or their enforcement could have a negative impact on our business in china in order to operate in china all games must have regulatory approval a decision by the chinese government to revoke its approval for any of our games or to decline to approve any products we desire to sell in china in the future could have a negative impact on our business 

we are subject to a variety of laws in the us and abroad that affect our business including state and federal laws regarding consumer protection electronic marketing protection of minors data protection and privacy competition taxation intellectual property export and national security which are continuously evolving and developing the scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting particularly laws outside the us there is a risk that existing or future laws may be interpreted in a manner that is not consistent with our current practices and could have an adverse effect on our business we incur legal compliance costs associated with our international operations and could become subject to legal penalties in foreign countries if we do not comply with local laws and regulations which may be substantially different from those in the us in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it may be common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by us laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and by local laws such as laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations including those based in countries where practices which violate such laws may be customary will not take actions in violation of our policies any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we are potentially subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect the offering of certain types of content such as that which depicts violence many of which are ambiguous still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business or expose us to liability in addition there are ongoing academic political and regulatory discussions in the us europe australia brazil and other jurisdictions regarding whether certain game genres such as social casino or certain game mechanics such as “loot boxes” should be subject to a higher level or different type of regulation than other game genres or mechanics to protect consumers in particular minors and persons susceptible to addiction and if so what such regulation should include 

in 2020 the uk left the european union eu brexit subsequently the uk and the eu struck a bilateral trade and cooperation deal governing the future relationship between the uk and the eu the trade and cooperation agreement which took effect on may 1 2021 there remains unavoidable uncertainties and risks to our business related to brexit and the new relationship between the uk and eu which will continue to be developed and defined we are preparing to mitigate those risks with operational and commercial changes to the extent possible and warranted however the legal and regulatory landscape remains uncertain and we have no assurance that such preparations will enable us to avoid a material adverse impact on our business from brexit brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace and replicate for example if there are changes to uk immigration policy as a result of brexit our employees and their ability to move freely between the eu member states for workrelated matters could be affected 

the effects of the uks future trade agreements with the eu or other nations could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and may cause us to lose customers distributors and employees the trade and cooperation agreement sets out preferential arrangements in areas such as the trade in goods and services but does not reach the level of integration that existed while the uk was an eu member state which could have a detrimental impact on our uk growth such a decline could also make our doing business in europe more difficult which could negatively affect sales to consumers of our products without access to the single eu market it may be more challenging and costly to distribute our products in europe 

connectivity issues could affect our profitability and our ability to sell and provide online services for our products 

we rely upon thirdparty digital delivery platforms such as microsofts xbox live playstation network steam epic and other thirdparty service providers to provide connectivity from the consumer to our digital products and our online services connectivity issues could prevent customers from accessing this content and our ability to successfully market and sell our products could be adversely affected given the increasing global usage of online platforms in part as a result of the covid19 pandemic the risks of connectivity issues may be heightened in addition we could experience similar issues related to services we host on our internal servers such issues also could affect our ability to provide gamerelated services and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business any significant system or network disruption could have a negative impact on our business 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks some of which are within taketwo and some of which are managed or hosted by thirdparty providers all information technology systems and networks are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources including but not limited to cyberattacks computer viruses malicious software security breaches energy blackouts natural disasters terrorism war and telecommunication failures we may also face sophisticated attacks referred to as advanced persistent threats which are cyberattacks aimed at compromising our intellectual property and other commercially sensitive information such as the source code and game assets for our software or confidential customer or employee information which remain undetected for prolonged periods of time information technology system disruptions network failures or security breaches could negatively affect our business continuity operations and financial results these risks extend to the networks and ecommerce sites of console platform providers and other partners who sell or host our content online the risk of such threats may be heightened as a result of international conflicts such as the one between russia and ukraine or as a result of an extended period of remote work arrangements due to covid19 along with our partners we have expended and expect to continue to expend financial and operational resources to implement certain systems processes and technologies to guard against cyber risks and to help protect our data and systems however the techniques used to exploit disable damage disrupt or gain access to our networks our products and services supporting technological infrastructure intellectual property and other assets change frequently continue to evolve in sophistication and volume and often are not detected for long periods of time our systems processes and technologies and the systems processes and technologies of our business partners or our thirdparty service providers may not be adequate against all eventualities in addition the costs to respond to mitigate or notify affected parties of cyberattacks and other security vulnerabilities are significant any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or cyber risks or detect or respond adequately to a security breach or cyber risk could result in a loss of anticipated revenue interruptions to our products and services our having to incur significant remediation and notification costs degrade the user experience cause consumers to lose confidence in our products and services and significant legal and financial costs additionally applicable insurance policies may be insufficient to reimburse us for all such losses and it is uncertain whether we will be able to maintain the current level of insurance coverage in the future on reasonable terms or at all 

successful exploitation of our systems can have other negative effects upon the products services and user experience we offer in particular the virtual economies that we have established in many of our games are subject to abuse exploitation and other forms of fraudulent activity that can negatively affect our business virtual economies involve the use of virtual currency or virtual assets that can be used or redeemed by a player within a particular game or service although we have implemented and continue to develop programs reasonably designed to prevent such negative impacts the abuse or exploitation of our virtual economies can include the illegitimate generation and sale of virtual items in black markets these kinds of activities and the steps that we take to address and prevent these issues may result in a loss of anticipated revenue interfere with players’ enjoyment of a balanced game environment and cause reputational harm 

we depend on servers and internet bandwidth to operate our games and digital services with online features if we were to lose server capacity or lack sufficient internet bandwidth for any reason our business could suffer 

we rely on data servers including those owned or controlled by third parties to enable our customers to download our games and other downloadable content and to operate our online games and other products with online functionality events such as limited hardware failure any broadbased catastrophic server malfunction a significant intrusion by hackers that circumvents security measures or a failure of disaster recovery services would likely interrupt the functionality of our games with online services and could result in a loss of sales for games and related services an extended interruption of service could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we expect a significant portion of our games to be online enabled in the future and therefore we must project our future server needs and make advance purchases of servers or server capacity to accommodate expected business demands if we underestimate the amount of server capacity our business requires or if our business were to grow more quickly than expected or if internet bandwidth becomes limited for example as a result of covid19related increased worldwide demand our consumers may experience service problems such as slow or interrupted gaming access insufficient server capacity may result in decreased sales a loss of our consumer base and adverse consequences to our reputation conversely if we overestimate the amount of server capacity required by our business we may incur additional operating costs 

because of the importance of our online business to our revenues and results of operations our ability to access adequate internet bandwidth and online computational resources to support our business is critical if the price of such resources increases we may not be able to increase our prices or subscriber levels to compensate for such costs which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we use open source software in connection with certain of our games and services which may pose particular risks to our proprietary software products and services in a manner that could have a negative impact on our business 

we use open source software in connection with certain of our games and the services we offer some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software or make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost the terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by courts and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our use of the open source software if it were determined that our use was not in compliance with a particular license we may be required to release our proprietary source code pay damages for breach of contract reengineer our games discontinue distribution in the event reengineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our game development efforts any of which could harm our business 

our software is susceptible to errors which can harm our financial results and reputation 

the technological advancements of new hardware platforms result in the development of more complex software products as software products become more complex the risk of undetected errors in new products increases we may need to produce and distribute patches in order to repair such errors which could be costly and may distract our developers from working on new products if despite testing errors are found in new products or releases after shipments have been made we may have to consider suspending distribution of defective products or offering refunds and we could experience a loss of or delay in timely market acceptance product returns loss of revenue increases in costs relating to the repair of such errors and damage to our reputation in such an event the technological reliability and stability of our products and services could be below our standards and the standards of our players and our reputation brand and sales could be adversely affected in addition we could be required to or may find it necessary to offer a refund for the product or service suspend the availability or sale of the product or service or expend significant resources to cure the defect bug or error each of which could significantly harm our business and operating results 

our ability to acquire and maintain licenses to intellectual property especially for sports titles affects our revenue and profitability competition for these licenses may make them more expensive and increase our costs 

certain of our products are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others for example certain of our 2k products include rights licensed from major sports leagues and players associations similarly some of our other titles are based on licenses of popular entertainment products competition for these licenses is intense if we are unable to maintain and renew these licenses or obtain additional licenses on reasonable economic terms or with significant commercial value our revenue and profitability could decline significantly competition for these licenses may also increase the advances guarantees and royalties that we must pay to the licensor which could significantly increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability in addition on certain intellectual property licenses we are subject to guaranteed minimum payments royalties or standards of performance and may not be able to terminate these agreements prior to their stated expiration if such licensed products do not generate revenues in excess of such minimum guarantees our profitability will be adversely affected 

we may experience declines or fluctuations in the recurring portion of our business 

our business model includes revenue that we expect to be recurring in nature such as revenue from our annualized titles and associated services and ongoing mobile businesses while we have been able to forecast the revenue from these areas of our business with greater certainty than for new offerings we cannot provide assurances that consumers will purchase these games and services on a consistent basis furthermore we may cease to offer games and services that we previously had deemed to be recurring in nature consumer purchases of our games and services may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including their level of satisfaction with our games and services our ability to improve and innovate our annualized titles our ability to adapt our games and services to new platforms outages and disruptions of online services the games and services offered by our competitors our marketing and advertising efforts or declines in consumer activity generally as a result of economic downturns for example as a result of covid19 among others any decline or fluctuation in this portion of our business may have a negative impact on our financial and operating results 

our efforts to expand into new products and services may subject us to additional risks 

in recent years we have continued to invest in emerging opportunities in interactive entertainment played on mobile platforms including tablets and smartphones and online platforms including social networks we have also grown our product offerings that are available through digital download including virtual currency through our existing franchises such as grand theft auto and nba 2k as well as through our mobile product offerings we are actively investing to capitalize on these trends in order to diversify our product mix reduce our operating risks and increase our revenue there are risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed while we anticipate growth in this area of our business consumer demand is difficult to predict as a result of a number of factors 

including satisfaction with our products and services our ability to provide engaging products and services third parties offering their products and services within our subscription partners that provide or don’t provide access to our subscription products and services offered by our competitors reliability of our infrastructure and the infrastructure of our partners pricing the actual or perceived security of our and our partners information technology systems and reductions in consumer spending levels there is no assurance that we will be able to attract a sufficiently large number of customers or recover costs incurred for developing and marketing any of these new products or services for example we may offer games that do not attract sufficient purchases of virtual currency which may cause our investments into this product space such as through our acquisitions of social point and playdots or our pending acquisition of zynga to fail to realize the expected benefits external factors such as competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also have an impact on the successful implementation of any new products or services failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

our quarterly and annual operating results are dependent on the release of hit titles and therefore dependent on the timing of our product releases which may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate significantly 

we have experienced and may continue to experience wide fluctuations in quarterly operating results the release of a hit title typically leads to a high level of sales during the first few months after introduction followed by a rapid decline in sales in addition the interactive entertainment industry is highly seasonal with sales typically higher during the fourth calendar quarter due primarily to increased demand for games during the holiday season demand for and sales of titles in our nba 2k series are also seasonal in that they are typically released just prior to the start of the nba season if a key event or sports season to which our product release schedule is tied were to be delayed or interrupted as has happened as a result of covid19 our sales might also suffer disproportionately our failure or inability to produce hit titles or introduce products on a timely basis to meet seasonal fluctuations in demand could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results the uncertainties associated with software development manufacturing lead times production delays and the approval process for products by hardware manufacturers and other licensors make it difficult to predict the quarter in which our products will ship and therefore may cause us to fail to meet financial expectations we also expect that a relatively limited number of popular franchises will continue to produce a disproportionately high percentage of our revenues and profits due to this dependence on a limited number of franchises the failure to achieve anticipated results by one or more products based on these franchises could negatively impact our business additionally if the popularity of a franchise declines as has happened in the past with other popular franchises we may have to write off the unrecovered portion of the underlying intellectual property assets which could negatively impact our business 

we are dependent on the future success of our grand theft auto products and we must continue to publish hit titles or sequels to such hit titles in order to compete successfully in our industry 

grand theft auto and certain of our other titles such as red dead redemption or nba 2k  are hit products and have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue grand theft auto products contributed 309 of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2022 and the five bestselling franchises including grand theft auto  which may change year over year in the aggregate accounted for 832 of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2022 if we fail to continue to develop and sell new commercially successful hit titles or sequels to such hit titles or experience any delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of our hit titles or their sequels our revenue and profits may decrease substantially and we may incur losses in addition competition in our industry is intense and a relatively small number of hit titles account for a large portion of total revenue in our industry hit products offered by our competitors may take a larger share of consumer spending than we anticipate which could cause revenue generated from our products to fall below our expectations if our competitors develop more successful products or services at lower price points or based on payment models perceived as offering better value or if we do not continue to develop consistently high quality and wellreceived products and services our revenue and profitability may decline in addition both the online and mobile games marketplaces are characterized by frequent product introductions relatively low barriers to entry and new and evolving business methods technologies and platforms for development widespread consumer adoption of these new platforms for games and other technological advances in andor new business or payment models in online or mobile game offerings could negatively affect our sales of console and traditional pc products before we have an opportunity to develop profitable businesses in such markets 

price protection granted to our customers and returns of our published titles by our customers or sales of used video games may adversely affect our operating results 

we are exposed to the risk of price protection and product returns with respect to our customers our distribution arrangements with customers generally do not give them the right to return titles to us or to cancel firm orders however we sometimes accept product returns from our distribution customers for stock balancing and negotiate accommodations for customers which include credits and returns when demand for specific products falls below expectations we grant price protection and accept returns in connection with our publishing arrangements and revenue is recognized after deducting estimated price protection and reserves for returns while we believe that we can reliably estimate price protection and returns 

if price protection and return rates for our products exceed our reserves our revenue could decline which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results certain of our larger customers sell used video games which are generally priced lower than new video games if our customers increase their sales of used video games it could negatively affect our sales of new video games 

a limited number of customers account for a significant portion of our sales the loss of a principal customer or other significant business relationship could seriously hurt our business 

a substantial portion of our product sales are made to a limited number of customers sales to our five largest customers during the fiscal year ended march 31 2022 accounted for 790 of our net revenue with sony and microsoft each accounting for more than 100 our sales are made primarily without longterm agreements or other commitments and our customers may terminate their relationship with us at any time certain of our customers may decline to carry products containing mature content the loss of our relationships with principal customers or a decline in sales to principal customers including as a result of a product being rated ao age 18 and over could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results in addition if our customers are subject to pricing pressures due to deteriorating demand for our products competition or otherwise such customers may pass those pricing pressures through to us which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

in addition because some of our customers are also publishers of games for their own hardware platforms and may manufacture products for other licensees such customers may give priority to their own products or those of our competitors accordingly console manufacturers like sony or microsoft could cause unanticipated delays in the release of our products as well as increases to projected development manufacturing marketing or distribution costs any of which could negatively impact our business 

furthermore our customers may also be placed into bankruptcy become insolvent or be liquidated due to economic downturns global credit contractions or other factors for example as a result of covid19 bankruptcies or consolidations of certain large retail customers could seriously hurt our business including as a result of uncollectible accounts receivable from such customers and the concentration of purchasing power among large retailers in addition our results of operations may be adversely affected if certain of our customers who purchase on credit terms are no longer eligible to purchase on such terms due to their financial distress or lack of credit insurance which may reduce the quantity of products they demand from us 

content policies adopted by retailers consumer opposition and litigation could negatively affect sales of our products 

retailers including digital storefronts and platform partners may decline to sell interactive entertainment software containing what they judge to be graphic violence sexually explicit material or other content that they deem inappropriate if retailers decline to sell our products based on their opinion that they contain objectionable themes graphic violence sexually explicit material or other generally objectionable content or if any of our previously m rated series products are rated ao we might be required to significantly change or discontinue particular titles or series which in the case of our bestselling grand theft auto titles could seriously affect our business consumer advocacy groups have opposed sales of interactive entertainment software containing objectionable themes violence sexual material or other objectionable content by pressing for legislation in these areas and by engaging in public demonstrations and media campaigns additionally although lawsuits seeking damages for injuries allegedly suffered by third parties as a result of video games have generally been unsuccessful in the courts claims of this kind have been asserted against us from time to time and may be asserted and be successful in the future an increase in the number of lawsuits filed by the families of victims of violence may trigger supplemental governmental scrutiny damage our reputation and negatively affect the sale of our products further in 2019 the world health organization included gaming disorder in the 11th revision of the international classification of diseases leading some to consider legislation and policies aimed at addressing this issue in addition public dialogue concerning interactive entertainment may have an adverse impact on our reputation and our customers willingness to purchase our products 

we submit our products for rating by the entertainment software rating board esrb in the united states and other voluntary or government ratings organizations in foreign countries failure to obtain a target rating for certain of our products could negatively affect our ability to distribute and sell those games as could the rerating of a game for any reason 

we voluntarily submit our game products to the esrb a usbased nonprofit and independent ratings organization the esrb system provides consumers with information about game content using a rating symbol that generally suggests the appropriate player age group and specific content descriptors such as graphic violence profanity or sexually explicit material the esrb may impose significant penalties on game publishers for violations of its rules related to rating or marketing games including revocation of a rating or monetary fines other countries require voluntary or government backed ratings as prerequisites for product sales in some instances we may have to modify our products in order to market them under the target 

rating which could delay or disrupt the release of our products in addition some of our titles may not be sold at all or without extensive edits in certain countries 

in the us if the esrb rates a game as ao age 18 and older platform licensors may not certify the game and retailers may refuse to sell it in addition some consumers have reacted to reratings or controversial game content by refusing to purchase such games demanding refunds for games that they had already purchased and refraining from buying other games published by us many of our rockstar titles and certain of our 2k titles have been rated m age 17 and older by the esrb if we are unable to obtain m ratings and instead receive ao ratings on future versions of those or similar titles as a result of changes in the esrbs ratings standards or for other reasons including the adoption of legislation in this area our business and prospects could be negatively affected if any of our games are rerated by the esrb or other foreignbased ratings organizations we could be exposed to litigation administrative fines and penalties and other potential liabilities and our operating results and financial condition could be significantly affected 

we have implemented processes to comply with the requirements of the esrb and other ratings organizations and properly display the designated rating symbols and content descriptions nonetheless these processes are subject to human error circumvention overriding and reasonable resource constraints if a video game we publish were found to contain undisclosed pertinent content the esrb could rerate a game retailers could refuse to sell it and demand that we accept the return of any unsold copies or returns from customers and consumers could refuse to buy it or demand that we refund their money this could have a material negative effect on our operating results and financial condition in addition we may be exposed to litigation administrative fines and penalties and our reputation could be harmed which could affect sales of our other video games if any of these were to occur our business and financial performance could be significantly harmed 

certain other countries have also established content rating systems as prerequisites for product sales in those countries in addition certain stores use other ratings systems such as apple’s use of its proprietary “app rating system” and google play’s use of the international age rating coalition “iarc” rating system if we are unable to obtain the ratings we have targeted for our products it could have a negative impact on our business in some instances we may be required to modify our products to meet the requirements of the rating systems which could delay or disrupt the release of any given product or may prevent its sale altogether in certain territories further if one of our games is “re‑rated” for any reason a ratings organization could require corrective actions which could include a recall retailers could refuse to sell it and demand that we accept the return of any unsold or returned copies or consumers could demand a refund for copies previously purchased 

additionally retailers may decline to sell interactive entertainment software containing what they judge to be graphic violence or sexually explicit material or other content that they deem inappropriate for their businesses whether because a product received a certain rating by the esrb or other content rating system or otherwise if retailers decline to sell our products based upon their opinion that they contain objectionable themes graphic violence or sexually explicit material or other generally objectionable content we might be required to modify particular titles or forfeit the revenue opportunity of selling such titles with that retailer 

if we are unable to protect the intellectual property relating to our software the commercial value of our products will be adversely affected and our competitive position could be harmed 

we develop proprietary software and have obtained the rights to publish and distribute software developed by third parties we attempt to protect our software and production techniques under patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as through contractual restrictions on disclosure copying and distribution nonetheless our software is susceptible to piracy and unauthorized copying and third parties may potentially exploit or misappropriate our intellectual property and proprietary information causing significant reputational damage unauthorized third parties for example may be able to copy or to reverse engineer our software to obtain and use programming or production techniques that we regard as proprietary well organized piracy operations have also proliferated in recent years resulting in the ability to download pirated copies of our software over the internet although we attempt to incorporate protective measures into our software piracy of our products could negatively affect our future profitability in addition cheating programs or other unauthorized software tools and modifications that enable consumers to cheat in games harm the experience of players who play fairly and could negatively impact the volume of microtransactions or purchases of downloadable content also vulnerabilities in the design of our applications and of the platforms upon which they run could be discovered after their release this may lead to lost revenues from paying consumers or increased cost of developing technological measures to respond to these either of which could negatively affect our business 

we are or may be subject to contractual covenants which place certain limitations on how we manage our business  

our credit agreement the credit agreement may limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt paying dividends repurchasing shares and acquiring or disposing of assets or businesses accordingly we may be restricted from taking actions that management believes would be desirable and in the best interests of us and our stockholders our credit agreement also requires us to satisfy specified financial covenants and comply with other affirmative 

and negative covenants a breach of any of the covenants contained in our credit agreement could result in an event of default which would allow our lenders to pursue various remedies including accelerating the repayment of any outstanding indebtedness under our credit agreement 

risks related to legal or regulatory compliance 

change in government regulations relating to the internet could have a negative impact on our business 

we rely on our consumers access to significant levels of internet bandwidth for the sale and digital delivery of our content and the functionality of our games with online features changes in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth popularity or use of the internet including laws affecting net neutrality or measures enacted in certain jurisdictions as a result of the covid19 pandemic could decrease the demand for our products and services or increase our cost of doing business although certain jurisdictions have implemented laws and regulations intended to prevent internet service providers from discriminating against particular types of legal traffic on their networks other jurisdictions may lack such laws and regulations or repeal existing laws or regulations for example on december 14 2017 the federal communications commission voted to repeal net neutrality regulations in the us and following that decision several states enacted net neutrality regulations given uncertainty around these rules including changing interpretations amendments or repeal coupled with the potentially significant political and economic power of local internet service providers and the relatively significant level of internet bandwidth access our products and services require we could experience discriminatory or anticompetitive practices that could impede our growth cause us to incur additional expenses or otherwise negatively affect our business 

our business and products are subject to potential legislation the adoption of such proposed legislation could limit the retail market for our products 

several proposals have been made for federal legislation to regulate our industry such proposals seek to prohibit the sale of products containing certain content included in some of our games if any such proposals are enacted into law it may limit the potential market for some of our games in the us and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results other countries have adopted laws regulating content both in packaged games and those transmitted over the internet that are stricter than current us laws in the us proposals have also been made by numerous state legislators to regulate and prohibit the sale of interactive entertainment software products containing certain types of violent or sexual content to audiences under the ages of 17 or 18 such as the state of californias ultraviolent video games law that sought to ban the sale or rental of violent video games to minors while such legislation to date has been enjoined by industry and retail groups or been found unconstitutional the adoption into law of such legislation in federal andor in state jurisdictions in which we do significant business could severely limit the retail market for some of our games 

certain of our business models and features within our games and services are subject to new laws or regulations or evolving interpretations and application of existing laws and regulations including those related to gambling the growth and development of electronic commerce virtual items and virtual currency has prompted calls for new laws and regulations and resulted in the application of existing laws or regulations that have limited or restricted the sale of our products and services in certain territories in addition certain foreign countries allow government censorship of interactive entertainment software products or require preapproval processes of uncertain length before our games and services can be offered adoption of ratings systems censorship restrictions on distribution and changes to approval processes or the status of any approvals could harm our business by limiting the products we are able to offer to our consumers in addition compliance with new and possibly inconsistent regulations for different territories could be costly delay or prevent the release of our products in those territories 

the laws and regulations concerning data privacy and certain other aspects of our business are continually evolving failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business 

we are subject to certain privacy and data protection laws including those in the us certain activities related to processing the personal data of individuals in the eu are conducted by our ukbased data controller or our local entities in the eu the us childrens online privacy protection act also regulates the collection use and disclosure of personal information from children under 13 years of age failure to comply with privacy and data protection laws or age restrictions may increase our costs subject us to expensive and distracting government investigations and result in substantial fines or result in lawsuits and claims against us to the extent these laws include a private right of action 

privacy and data protection laws and industry terms are rapidly changing and likely will continue to do so for the foreseeable future which could have an impact on our approach to operating and marketing our games and which may harm the sales of our products or decrease the size of our potential audience for example the eu general data protection regulation gdpr and the uk data protection act 2018 dpa 2018 both became effective in may 2018 gdpr and dpa 2018 apply to us because we receive and process the personal information of individuals in the eu and the uk and we maintain certain local entities in the eu and the uk responsible for processing personal information gdpr and dpa 2018 contain 

significant penalties for noncompliance countries in the eu are still enacting national laws that correspond to certain portions of the gdpr the uk also implemented an age appropriate design code that applies to how personal data is used for individuals up to age 18 in the us the california consumer privacy act ccpa became effective on january 1 2020 and applies to processing of personal information of california residents california also enacted the california privacy rights act cpra which updates the ccpa and virginia enacted the consumer data protection act both effective january 1 2023 other states including nevada have enacted or are considering similar privacy or data protection laws that may apply to us the us government including the federal trade commission and the department of commerce also continue to review the need for greater or different regulation over the collection of personal information and information about consumer behavior on the internet and on mobile devices and the us congress is considering a number of legislative proposals to regulate in this area various government and consumer agencies worldwide have also called for new regulation and changes in industry practices further and most notably in the mobile ecosystem companies that provide the platforms on which our games are played are changing the terms on how publishers can collect and use personal data obtained from users on those platforms 

player use of our games is subject to our privacy policy end user license agreements eula and terms of service if we fail to comply with our posted privacy policy eula or terms of service or if we fail to comply with existing privacy or data protection laws and regulations it could result in proceedings or litigation against us by governmental authorities or others which could result in fines or judgments against us damage our reputation affect our financial condition and harm our business if regulators the media or consumers raise any concerns about our privacy and data protection or consumer protection practices even if unfounded this could also result in fines or judgments against us damage our reputation negatively affect our financial condition and damage our business 

it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted or construed to apply to us in the us and elsewhere that could restrict the interactive entertainment industry including player privacy advertising taxation content suitability copyright distribution and antitrust furthermore the growth and development of electronic commerce and virtual goods may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on companies such as ours conducting business through digital sales any such changes would require us to devote legal and other resources to address such regulation for example existing laws or new laws regarding the regulation of currency banking institutions and unclaimed property may be interpreted to cover virtual currency or virtual goods if that were to occur we may be required to seek licenses authorizations or approvals from relevant regulators the granting of which may be dependent on us meeting certain capital and other requirements and we may be subject to additional regulation and oversight all of which could significantly increase our operating costs changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the us or elsewhere regarding these activities may lessen the growth of the interactive entertainment industry and impair our business financial condition and operating results further in 2019 the world health organization included gaming disorder in the 11th revision of the international classification of diseases leading some to consider legislation and policies aimed at mitigating the overuse of and overspending within video games 

although we have structured and operate our skill tournaments and game mechanics including random digital item mechanics with applicable laws in mind including any applicable laws relating to gambling and believe that playing these games does not constitute gambling our skill tournaments or game mechanics could become subject to gamblingrelated rules and regulations or be deemed violative of current rules and regulations and expose us to civil and criminal penalties we also sometimes offer consumers of our online and casual games various types of contests and promotional opportunities we are subject to laws in a number of jurisdictions concerning the operation and offering of such activities and games many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business further random digital item mechanics may become subject to regulations in various jurisdictions if these were to occur we might be required to seek licenses authorizations or approvals from relevant regulators the granting of which may be dependent on us meeting certain capital and other requirements and we may be subject to additional regulation and oversight such as reporting to regulators all of which could significantly increase our operating costs moreover the inclusion of random digital item mechanics has attracted the attention of the interactive gaming community and if the future implementation of these features creates a negative perception of gameplay fairness or other negative perceptions our reputation and brand could be harmed and revenue could be negatively impacted changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the us the eu or elsewhere regarding these activities may lessen the growth of online or casual game services and impair our business also existing laws or new laws regarding the marketing of ingame or inapp purchases regulation of currency banking institutions unclaimed property or money laundering may be interpreted to cover virtual currency or goods 

if we infringe on or are alleged to infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties our business could be adversely affected 

as our industry grows we may be subject to an increasing amount of litigation that is common in the software industry based on allegations of infringement or other alleged violations of patent copyright or trademarks in addition we believe that interactive entertainment software will increasingly become the subject of claims that such software infringes on 

the intellectual property rights of others with both the growth of online functionality and advances in technology game content and software graphics as games become more realistic from time to time we receive notices from third parties or are named in lawsuits by third parties alleging infringement of their proprietary rights although we believe that our software and technologies and the software and technologies of thirdparty developers and publishers with whom we have contractual relations do not and will not infringe or violate proprietary rights of others it is possible that infringement of proprietary rights of others may occur any claims of infringement with or without merit could be time consuming costly and difficult to defend moreover intellectual property litigation or claims could require us to discontinue the distribution of products obtain a license or redesign our products which could result in additional substantial costs and material delays 

in addition many patents have been issued that may apply to potential new modes of delivering playing or monetizing products and services such as those that we produce or would like to offer in the future we may discover that future opportunities to provide new and innovative modes of game play and game delivery may be precluded by existing patents that we are unable to acquire or license on reasonable terms 

risks related to financial and economic condition 

delaware law our charter documents and provisions of our debt agreements may impede or discourage a takeover which could cause the market price of our shares to decline 

we are a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders our board of directors has the power without stockholder approval to adopt a stockholder rights plan andor to designate the terms of one or more series of preferred stock and issue shares of preferred stock the ability of our board of directors to create and issue a new series of preferred stock and certain provisions of delaware law our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede a merger takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock which under certain circumstances could reduce the market price of our common stock and the value of any outstanding notes 

changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 

we are a multinational corporation with operations in the us and various other jurisdictions around the world accordingly we are subject to tax in the us and in various other jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are required to estimate future taxes although we currently believe our tax estimates are reasonable the estimation process is inherently uncertain and such estimates are not binding on tax authorities further our effective tax rate or tax payable could be adversely affected by a variety of factors including changes in the business the mix and level of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets changes in tax elections and changes in applicable tax laws additionally tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities and developments in those audits could adversely affect our income tax provision should the ultimate tax liability exceed estimates our income tax provision and net income or loss could be materially affected 

beginning in 2022 the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 “tcja” eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures currently and requires taxpayers to amortize them pursuant to irc section 174 although congress is considering legislation that would defer the capitalization and amortization requirement to later years we have no assurance that the requirement will be deferred repealed or otherwise modified the requirement was effective for the company for fiscal year 2023 beginning april 1 2022 it is possible that this change could have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate tax payments and financial condition in future periods 

in addition the us enacted the american rescue plan act of 2021 “arpa” which provided numerous tax and other stimulus measures one such measure will expand limitation of compensation deductions for certain covered employees of publicly held corporations beginning in 2027 to also include our next five highly compensated employees it is possible that these changes could have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate tax payments and financial condition in future periods 

additionally a number of countries are actively pursuing fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to multinational companies like us including an increasing number that have enacted or are considering enacting revenuebased taxes on digital services these digital services taxes target various business activities including online advertising and in some cases video game sales while the scope and applicability of these taxes often remains unclear digital services taxes that ultimately apply to us could have an adverse impact on our business 

we are subject to risks and uncertainties of international trade including fluctuations in the values of local foreign currencies against the dollar 

sales in international markets primarily in europe have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2022 401 of our net revenue was earned outside the us we are continuing to execute on our growth initiatives in asia where our strategy is to broaden the distribution of our existing products and expand our online gaming presence especially in china and south korea we are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade including increased credit risks tariffs and duties fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates shipping delays and international political regulatory and economic developments such as those relating to the conflict between russia and ukraine all of which can have a significant influence on our operating results many of our international sales are made in local currencies which could fluctuate against the dollar while we may use forward exchange contracts to a limited extent to seek to mitigate foreign currency risk our operating results could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations 

our reported financial results could be adversely affected by the application of existing or future accounting standards to our business as it evolves 

our financial results are reported under the accounting policies promulgated by the sec and national accounting standards bodies and the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies for example standards regarding revenue recognition have and could further significantly affect the way we account for revenue related to our products and services we expect that an increasing number of our games will be supported with material postrelease activities such as content updates and onlineenabled features and we could therefore be required to recognize more of the related revenues for those games over a period of time rather than at the time of sale further as we increase our downloadable content and add new features to our online services user playing patterns can affect our estimate of the service period and we could be required to recognize revenues and defer related costs over a shorter or longer period of time than we initially allocated as we enhance expand and diversify our business and product offerings the application of existing or future financial accounting standards particularly those relating to the way we account for revenue could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results although not necessarily on our cash flows 

declines in consumer spending and other adverse changes in the economy could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

most of our products involve discretionary spending on the part of consumers we believe that consumer spending is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income this makes our products particularly sensitive to general economic conditions and economic cycles as consumers are generally more willing to make discretionary purchases including purchases of products like ours during periods in which favorable economic conditions prevail adverse economic conditions such as a prolonged us or international general economic downturn such as those caused by covid19 including periods of increased inflation unemployment levels tax rates interest rates energy prices or declining consumer confidence could also reduce consumer spending reduced consumer spending has and may in the future continue to result in reduced demand for our products and may also require increased selling and promotional expenses which has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results in addition during periods of relative economic weakness our consolidated credit risk reflecting our counterparty dealings with distributors customers capital providers and others may increase perhaps materially so as a result of covid19 our counterparty credit risk may be particularly exacerbated as certain of our counterparties may face financial difficulties in paying owed amounts on a timely basis or at all furthermore uncertainty and adverse changes in the economy could also increase the risk of material losses on our investments increase costs associated with developing and publishing our products increase the cost and availability of sources of financing and increase our exposure to material losses from bad debts any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results if economic conditions worsen our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 

we are particularly susceptible to market conditions and risks associated with the entertainment industry which in addition to general macroeconomic downturns also include the popularity price and timing of our products changes in consumer demographics the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment and leisure and critical reviews and public tastes and preferences which may change rapidly and cannot necessarily be predicted 

general risk factors 

additional issuances or sales of equity securities by us would dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

we may issue equity or equitybased securities in the future to facilitate acquisitions or strategic transactions to adjust our ratio of debt to equity to fund expansion of our operations or for other purposes to the extent we issue additional equity securities the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders would be reduced the sale of substantial amounts of our

trends and factors affecting our business 

product release schedule our financial results are affected by the timing of our product releases and the commercial success of those titles our grand theft auto products in particular have historically accounted for a significant portion of our revenue sales of grand theft auto products generated 309 of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2022 the timing of our grand theft auto product releases may affect our financial performance on a quarterly and annual basis 

economic environment and retailer performance we continue to monitor economic conditions including the impact of the covid19 pandemic that may affect our businesses such as consumer demand pricing pressure on our products credit quality of our receivables and foreign currency exchange rates the covid19 pandemic has affected and may continue to affect our business operations including our employees customers partners and communities and there is substantial uncertainty in the nature and degree of its continued effects over time during fiscal year 2021 as in the final quarter of fiscal year 2020 we noted a positive impact to our results that we believe was partly due to increased consumer engagement with our products because of the covid19 related business closures and movement restrictions such as shelter in place and lockdown orders implemented around the world as well as the online accessibility and social nature of our products as 

expected during fiscal year 2022 we experienced a moderation in engagement from the alltime highs experienced in fiscal year 2021 but overall engagement continued to be notably higher than it was prepandemic 

based on our concern for the health and safety of our teams we have developed and continue to develop plans to help mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on our business including transitioning the vast majority of our teams to working from home the majority of our offices either have reopened or are scheduled to reopen in the coming months given the evolving dynamics of the covid19 pandemic we continue to adhere to safety standards in the planning and implementation of our return to office to date our plans have resulted in minimal disruption however despite largely positive outcomes to date these efforts may ultimately not be effective and a protracted economic downturn may limit the effectiveness of our mitigation efforts any of these considerations described above could cause or contribute to the risks described above in item 1a of this form 10k and could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or stock price therefore the effects of covid19 may not be fully reflected in our financial results until future periods and at this time we are not able to predict its ultimate impact on our business 

additionally our business is dependent upon a limited number of customers that account for a significant portion of our revenue our five largest customers accounted for 790 784 and 715 of net revenue during the fiscal years ended march 31 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively as of march 31 2022 and 2021 five customers comprised 728 and 776 of our gross accounts receivable respectively with our significant customers those that individually comprised more than 10 of our gross accounts receivable balance accounting for 638 and 692 of such balance at march 31 2022 and 2021 respectively we had two customers who accounted for 435 and 203 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2022 and two customers who accounted for 504 and 188 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2021 we did not have any additional customers that exceeded 10 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2022 and 2021 the economic environment has affected our customers in the past and may do so in the future including as a result of the covid19 pandemic bankruptcies or consolidations of our large retail customers could seriously hurt our business due to uncollectible accounts receivables and the concentration of purchasing power among the remaining large retailers the covid19 pandemic has led and may continue to lead to increased consolidation as larger better capitalized competitors will be in a stronger position to withstand prolonged periods of economic downturn and sustain their business through the financial volatility certain of our large customers sell used copies of our games which may negatively affect our business by reducing demand for new copies of our games while the downloadable content that we now offer for certain of our titles may serve to reduce used game sales we expect used game sales to continue to adversely affect our business 

hardware platforms we derive most of our revenue from the sale of products made for video game consoles manufactured by third parties which comprised 722 of our net revenue by product platform for the fiscal year ended march 31 2022 the success of our business is dependent upon the consumer acceptance of these platforms and the continued growth in the installed base of these platforms when new hardware platforms are introduced such as those released in november 2020 by sony and microsoft demand for interactive entertainment used on older platforms typically declines which may negatively affect our business during the market transition to the new consoles the new sony and microsoft consoles provide backwards compatibility ie the ability to play games for the previous generation of consoles which could mitigate the risk of such a decline however we cannot be certain how backwards compatibility will affect demand for our products further events beyond our control may impact the availability of these new consoles which may also affect demand we manage our product delivery on each current and future platform in a manner we believe to be most effective to maximize our revenue opportunities and achieve the desired return on our investments in product development accordingly our strategy is to focus our development efforts on a select number of the highest quality titles for these platforms while also expanding our offerings for other platforms such as tablets smartphones and online games 

online content and digital distribution the interactive entertainment software industry is delivering a growing amount of content through digital online delivery methods we provide a variety of online delivered products and offerings virtually all of our titles that are available through retailers as packaged goods products are also available through direct digital download from websites we own and others owned by third parties as well as a large selection of our catalog titles in addition we aim to drive ongoing engagement and incremental revenue from recurrent consumer spending on our titles through virtual currency addon content and ingame purchases we also publish an expanding variety of titles for mobile which are delivered to consumers through digital download as disclosed in our results of operations below net revenue from digital online channels comprised 898 of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2022 we expect online delivery of games and game offerings to continue to grow and to be the primary part of our business over the long term 

content release highlights

our income tax expense was 474 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2022 as compared to 889 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2021 

when compared to the statutory rate of 21 the effective tax rate of 102 for the fiscal year ended march 31 2022 was due primarily to a 309 million benefit from tax credits anticipated to be utilized 146 million in excess tax benefits from employee stock compensation an 116 million benefit due to an increase to the net deferred tax asset that arose from a step up in tax basis related to the federal act on tax reform and avh oldage and survivors insurance financing traf enacted in switzerland discussed below and an 80 million benefit from our geographic mix of earnings partially offset by a 101 million nondeductible expense due to an increase in fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with the acquisition of nordeus 

when compared to the statutory rate of 21 the effective tax rate of 131 for the fiscal year ended march 31 2021 was primarily due to a 291 million tax benefit from tax credits anticipated to be utilized a 214 million tax benefit from our geographic mix of earnings and 137 million in excess tax benefits from employee stock compensation 

the effective tax rate in the current year was lower compared to the prior year primarily due an increased benefit to the net deferred tax asset related to traf increased benefits from tax credits and excess tax benefits from employee stock compensation partially offset by a nondeductible expense due to an increase in fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with the acquisition of nordeus 

the accounting for sharebased compensation will increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our sharebased compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return which depends on the stock price at the time of the employee award vesting 

we anticipate that additional excess tax benefits or shortfalls from employee stock compensation tax credits and changes in our geographic mix of earnings could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate in the future in addition we are regularly examined by domestic and foreign taxing authorities examinations may result in tax assessments in excess of amounts claimed and the payment of additional taxes we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable tax assessments it is possible that settlement of audits or the expiration of the statute of limitations could have an impact on our effective tax rate in future periods 

the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 “tcja” requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize research and development costs pursuant to internal revenue code irc section 174 although congress is considering legislation that would defer the capitalization and amortization requirement to later years we have no assurance that the requirement will be repealed or 

otherwise modified the requirement is effective for the company for fiscal year 2023 beginning april 1 2022 it is possible that this change could have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate tax payments and financial condition in future periods 

on march 11 2021 the american rescue plan act of 2021 the “arpa” was enacted the arpa among other things includes provisions to expand the irc section 162m disallowance for deduction of certain compensation paid by publicly held corporations effective for tax years starting after december 31 2026 april 1 2027 for the company the arpa expands the limitation to cover the next five most highly compensated employees the arpa did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended march 31 2022 we continue to evaluate the potential impact the arpa may have on our operations and consolidated financial statements in future periods 

on march 27 2020 the us enacted the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the cares act which provides numerous tax and other stimulus measures that generally support the us economy the cares act did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

on may 19 2019 a public referendum held in switzerland approved the traf which was effective for us on january 1 2020 the traf abolished preferential tax regimes for holding companies domicile companies and mixed companies at the cantonal level the traf allows the cantons to establish transition rules the implementation of which may be subject to a ruling from the canton on march 31 2020 we recorded a deferred tax asset of 453 million offset by a valuation allowance of 334 million arising from the swiss cantonal tax basis stepup for the fiscal year ended march 31 2022 we recorded a net tax benefits of 116 million due to an increase in the deferred tax asset of 132 million offset by an increase in the valuation allowance of 16 million as it is morelikelythannot that such deferred tax assets would be realized 

as of march 31 2022 we had gross unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties of 1760 million of which 658 million would affect our effective tax rate if realized for the fiscal year ended march 31 2022 gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by 85 million 

we are no longer subject to audit for us federal income tax returns for periods prior to our fiscal year ended march 31 2019 and state income tax returns for periods prior to the fiscal year ended march 31 2018 with few exceptions we are no longer subject to income tax examinations in nonus jurisdictions for years prior to fiscal year ended march 31 2016 certain taxing authorities are currently examining our income tax returns for the fiscal years ended march 31 2015 through march 31 2019 

net income and earnings per share 

for the fiscal year ended march 31 2022 our net income was 4180 million as compared to 5889 million in the prior year diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended march 31 2022 was 358 as compared to 509 for the fiscal year ended march 31 2021 diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 1168 million were 10 million higher due primarily to normal stock compensation activity including vests as well as grants and forfeitures in the prior year being fully outstanding in the current year 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary cash requirements have been to fund i the development manufacturing and marketing of our published products ii working capital iii acquisitions and iv capital expenditures we expect to rely on cash and cash equivalents as well as on shortterm investments funds provided by our operating activities and our credit agreement to satisfy our working capital needs 

shortterm investments 

as of march 31 2022 we had 8201 million of shortterm investments which are highly liquid in nature and represent an investment of cash that is available for current operations from time to time we may purchase additional shortterm investments depending on future market conditions and liquidity needs as of march 31 2022 based on the composition of our investment portfolio and actions taken in recent years by central banks around the world to cut interest rates including the us federal reserve in response to the covid19 pandemic and related adverse economic conditions we anticipate investment yields to remain low which would lower our future interest income such impact is not expected to be material to our liquidity 

credit agreement 

on february 8 2019 we entered into an unsecured credit agreement the “credit agreement” and on june 28 2021 we amended our unsecured credit agreement solely to increase the commitments under the facility by 50 million as amended the “credit agreement” that runs through february 8 2024 the credit agreement provides for an unsecured five 

year revolving credit facility with commitments of 250 million including sublimits for i the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate face amount of up to 25 million and ii borrowings and letters of credit denominated in pounds sterling euros and canadian dollars in an aggregate principal amount of up to 25 million in addition the credit agreement contains uncommitted incremental capacity permitting the incurrence of up to an additional 200 million in term loans or revolving credit facilities 

loans under the credit agreement will bear interest at a rate of a 0250 to 0750 above a certain base rate 350 at march 31 2022 or b 1125 to 1750 above libor approximately 045 at march 31 2022 which rates are determined by reference to our consolidated total net leverage ratio the libor benchmark rate is expected to be phased out by the end of june 2023 we do not expect that the discontinuation of the libor rate will have a material impact on our liquidity or results of operations 

as of march 31 2022 there was 2475 million available to borrow under the credit agreement and we had 25 million of letters of credit outstanding at march 31 2022 we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement 

the credit agreement also includes among other terms and conditions maximum leverage ratio minimum cash reserves and in certain circumstances minimum interest coverage ratio financial covenants as well as limitations on the company’s and each of its subsidiaries’ ability to create incur assume or be liable for indebtedness dispose of assets outside the ordinary course acquire merge or consolidate with or into another person or entity create incur or allow any lien on any of its property make investments or pay dividends or make distributions in each case subject to certain exceptions in addition the credit agreement provides for certain events of default such as nonpayment of principal and interest when due thereunder breaches of representations and warranties noncompliance with covenants acts of insolvency and default on indebtedness held by third parties subject to certain limitations and cure periods 

financial condition 

we are subject to credit risks particularly if any of our receivables represent a limited number of customers or are concentrated in foreign markets if we are unable to collect our accounts receivable as they become due it could adversely affect our liquidity and working capital position 

generally we have been able to collect our accounts receivable in the ordinary course of business we do not hold any collateral to secure payment from customers we have trade credit insurance on the majority of customers who sell our physical products to mitigate accounts receivable risk 

a majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to major retailers including digital storefronts and platform partners and distributors our five largest customers accounted for 790 784 and 715 of net revenue during the fiscal years ended march 31 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively as of march 31 2022 and 2021 five customers accounted for 728 and 776 of our gross accounts receivable respectively customers that individually accounted for more than 10 of our gross accounts receivable balance comprised 638 and 488 of such balances at march 31 2022 and 2021 respectively we had two customers who accounted for 435 and 203 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2022 and two customers who accounted for 504 and 188 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2021 we did not have any additional customers that exceeded 10 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2022 and 2021 based upon performing ongoing credit evaluations maintaining trade credit insurance on a majority of our customers who sell our physical products and our past collection experience we believe that the receivable balances from these largest customers do not represent a significant credit risk although we actively monitor each customers creditworthiness and economic conditions that may affect our customers business and access to capital we are monitoring the current global economic conditions including credit markets and other factors as it relates to our customers in order to manage the risk of uncollectible accounts receivable including as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and projected cash flow from operations along with availability under our credit agreement will provide us with sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash requirements for working capital capital expenditures and commitments on both a shortterm and longterm basis our liquidity and capital resources have not been materially affected by the covid19 pandemic and related volatility and slowdown in the global financial markets to date for further discussion regarding the potential future impacts of the covid19 pandemic and related economic conditions on our business refer to item 1a risk factors  

as of march 31 2022 the amount of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the us by our foreign subsidiaries was 6572 million these balances are dispersed across various locations around the world we believe that such dispersion meets the business and liquidity needs of our foreign affiliates in addition we expect to have the ability to generate sufficient cash domestically to support ongoing operations for the foreseeable future 

on january 9 2022 we entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire zynga inc zynga a leading developer of mobile games under the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement zynga stockholders will receive 350 in cash and a number of shares of our common stock equal to the exchange ratio for each share of zynga common stock outstanding at the closing the transaction is valued at 986 per share of zynga common stock based on the market closing as of january 7 2022 implying an enterprise value of 127 billion the transaction includes a collar mechanism on the equity consideration so that if the volume weighted average price vwap of taketwo common stock on the nasdaq global select market for the consecutive period beginning at 930 am new york time on the twentythird trading day immediately preceding the closing date of the transaction and concluding at 400 pm new york time on the third trading day preceding such closing date is in a range from 15650 to 18188 the exchange ratio would be adjusted to deliver total consideration of 986 per zynga share if the vwap of our common stock for the period noted in the prior sentence exceeds the higher end of that range the exchange ratio would be 00350 per share and if the vwap is below the lower end of that range the exchange ratio would be 00406 per share 

the transaction which is currently anticipated to close on monday may 23 2022 is subject to approval by taketwo and zynga stockholders and the satisfaction of the other customary closing conditions 

in connection with the transaction on april 14 2022 we terminated our bridge loan and completed our offering and sale of 27 billion aggregate principal amount of our senior notes consisting of 10 billion principal amount of our 3300 senior notes due 2024 the “2024 notes” 600 million principal amount of our 3550 senior notes due 2025 the “2025 notes” 600 million principal amount of our 3700 senior notes due 2027 the “2027 notes” and 500 million principal amount of our 4000 senior notes due 2032 the “2032 notes” and together with the 2024 notes the 2025 notes and the 2027 notes the “notes”the notes were issued under an indenture between the company and the bank of new york mellon as trustee the “trustee”

our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 217 million shares of our common stock under this program we may purchase shares from time to time through a variety of methods including in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws repurchases are subject to the availability of stock prevailing market conditions the trading price of the stock our financial performance and other conditions the program does not require us to repurchase shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time for any reason 

during the fiscal years ended march 31 2022 2021 and 2020 we repurchased 13 million zero and zero shares of our common stock respectively in the open market for 200 million 00 million and 00 million respectively including commissions as part of the program as of march 31 2022 we had repurchased a total of 117 million shares of our common stock under the program and 100 million shares of our common stock remained available for repurchase under the share repurchase program 

our changes in cash flows were as follows 



at march 31 2022 we had 21953 million of cash cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents compared to 20602 million at march 31 2021 the increase in cash cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents from march 31 2021 was due primarily to i net cash provided by operating activities from sales primarily from the previously mentioned titles  partially offset by investments in software development and licenses as well as royalty payments and ii net cash provided by investing activities primarily related to net proceeds from available for sale securities 

changes in bank time deposits partially offset primarily by our acquisition of nordeus refer to note 22  acquisitions  and purchases of fixed assets including our acquisition of two office buildings in the uk refer to note 22  acquisitions  this net increase was partially offset by net cash used in financing activities which was primarily related to repurchase of our common stock and tax payments related to net share settlements of our restricted stock 

commitments 

refer to note 15  commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for disclosures regarding our commitments 

capital expenditures 

in fiscal year 2023 we anticipate capital expenditures to be 120 million 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of march 31 2022 and 2021 we did not have any material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial parties such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such we are not exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 

international operations 

net revenue earned outside of the united states is principally generated by our operations in europe asia australia canada and latin america for the fiscal years ended march 31 2022 2021 and 2020 401 402 and 425 respectively of our net revenue was earned outside the united states we are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade including increased credit risks tariffs and duties fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates shipping delays and international political regulatory and economic developments all of which can have a significant effect on our operating results 

fluctuations in quarterly operating results and seasonality 

we have experienced fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results as a result of the timing of the introduction of new titles variations in sales of titles developed for particular platforms market acceptance of our titles development and promotional expenses relating to the introduction of new titles sequels or enhancements of existing titles projected and actual changes in platforms the timing and success of title introductions by our competitors product returns changes in pricing policies by us and our competitors the accuracy of retailers forecasts of consumer demand the size and timing of acquisitions the timing of orders from major customers and order cancellations and delays in product shipment sales of our full game products are also seasonal with peak demand typically occurring in the fourth calendar quarter during the holiday season for certain of our software products with multiple performance obligations we defer the recognition of our net revenue over an estimated service period which generally ranges from six to fifteen months as a result the quarter in which we generate the highest net bookings may be different from the quarter in which we recognize the highest amount of net revenue quarterly comparisons of operating results are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential loss arising from fluctuations in market rates and prices our market risk exposures primarily include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates relates primarily to our shortterm investment portfolio and variable rate debt under the credit agreement 

we seek to manage our interest rate risk by maintaining a shortterm investment portfolio that includes corporate bonds with high credit quality and maturities less than two years since shortterm investments mature relatively quickly and can be reinvested at the thencurrent market rates interest income on a portfolio consisting of shortterm securities is more subject to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longerterm maturities however the fair value of a shortterm portfolio is less sensitive to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longerterm securities we do not currently use derivative financial instruments in our shortterm investment portfolio our investments are held for purposes other than trading 

as of march 31 2022 we had 8201 million of shortterm investments which included 6883 million of availableforsale securities the availableforsale securities were recorded at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax in stockholders equity we also had 17320 million of cash and cash equivalents that are comprised primarily of money market 

funds and banktime deposits we determined that based on the composition of our investment portfolio there was no material interest rate risk exposure to our consolidated financial statements or liquidity as of march 31 2022 

historically fluctuations in interest rates have not had a significant effect on our operating results under our credit agreement loans will bear interest at our election of a 0250 to 0750 above a certain base rate 350 at march 31 2022 or b 1125 to 1750 above the libor approximately 045 at march 31 2022 with the margin rate subject to the achievement of certain average liquidity levels changes in market rates may affect our future interest expense if there is an outstanding balance on our line of credit at march 31 2022 there were no outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we transact business in foreign currencies and are exposed to risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates accounts relating to foreign operations are translated into us dollars using prevailing exchange rates at the relevant period end translation adjustments are included as a separate component of stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheets for the fiscal years ended march 31 2022 and 2021 our foreign currency translation adjustment was a loss of 436 million and a gain of 513 million respectively we recognized a foreign currency exchange transaction loss of 73 million a gain of 07 million and a loss of 36 million for the fiscal years ended march 31 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively in interest and other net in our consolidated statements of operations 

balance sheet hedging activities 

we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with nonfunctional currency denominated cash balances and intercompany funding loans nonfunctional currency denominated accounts receivable and nonfunctional currency denominated accounts payable these transactions are not designated as hedging instruments and are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts is reported as either assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value are reported in interest and other net in our consolidated statements of operations we do not enter into derivative financial contracts for speculative or trading purposes at march 31 2022 we had 758 million of forward contracts outstanding to buy foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars and 1328 million of forward contracts outstanding to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars all of which have maturities of less than one year at march 31 2021 we had 921 million of forward contracts outstanding to buy foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars and 1405 million of forward contracts outstanding to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars all of which have maturities of less than one year for the fiscal years ended march 31 2022 2021 and 2020 we recorded a gain of 59 million a loss of 36 million and a loss of 10 million respectively related to foreign currency forward contracts in interest and other net on our consolidated statements of operations as of march 31 2022 and 2021 the fair value of these outstanding forward contracts was a loss of 02 million and a loss 01 million respectively and is included in accrued and other current liabilities the fair value of these outstanding forward contracts is estimated based on the prevailing exchange rates of the various hedged currencies as of the end of the period 

our hedging programs are designed to reduce but do not entirely eliminate the effect of currency exchange rate movements we believe that the counterparties to these foreign currency forward contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks and that the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risks there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations which may be more volatile as a result of the covid19 pandemic for the fiscal year ended march 31 2022 401 of our revenue was generated outside the united states using sensitivity analysis a hypothetical 10 increase in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would decrease revenue by 40 while a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would increase revenue by 40 in our opinion a substantial portion of this fluctuation would be offset by cost of goods sold and operating expenses incurred in local currency

we use a product investment review process to evaluate potential titles for investment to review existing titles in development and to assess titles after release by measuring their performance in the market and the return on our investment we apply this process to all of our products whether internally or externally developed the product investment review process includes reviews of each project at various stages of development by our executive management team and the senior management of our publishing labels and also includes coordination between our sales and marketing personnel before the launch of titles this disciplined approach to product investment is expected to enhance the competitiveness and profitability of our titles 

we develop our products using a combination of our internal development teams and external development resources acting under contract with us we typically select external developers based on their track record and expertise in developing products in the same category or genre one developer will generally produce the same game for multiple platforms and will also produce sequels to the original game we believe that selecting and using development resources in this manner allows us to leverage the particular expertise of our internal and external development resources which is designed to maintain our quality standards for our products

we are dependent on a limited number of customers that account for a significant portion of our sales sales to our five largest customers during the fiscal year ended march 31 2021 accounted for 784 of our net revenue with sony and microsoft each accounting for more than 100 of our net revenue during the fiscal year ended march 31 2021 

we also distribute our titles addon content and ingame purchases through direct digital download to consoles and pcs including smartphones and tablets we view digital distribution as an important growth opportunity for our industry and company however we expect that packaged goods and traditional retailers will continue to be a significant channel for the sale of our console products for the foreseeable future 

marketing 

our marketing and promotional efforts are intended to maximize consumer interest in our titles promote brand name recognition of our franchises assist retailers and properly position package and merchandise our titles from time to time we also receive marketing support from hardware manufacturers in connection with their own promotional efforts 

we market titles by 

• implementing public relations campaigns using social digital online television outdoor and print marketing including certain performance marketing programs we believe that we label and market our products in accordance with the applicable principles and guidelines of the entertainment software rating board or the esrb an independent selfregulatory body that assigns ratings and enforces advertising guidelines for the interactive software industry 

• stimulating continued sales by reducing the wholesale prices of our products to retailers digital storefronts and platform providers at various times during the life of a product price protection may occur at any time in a products life cycle but typically occurs three to nine months after a products initial launch in certain international markets we also provide volume rebates to stimulate continued product sales 

• employing various other marketing methods designed to promote consumer awareness including social media instore promotions and pointofpurchase displays direct mail cooperative advertising attendance at trade shows as well as product sampling through demonstration software distributed via the internet or the digital online services 

as of march 31 2021 we had a sales and marketing staff of 651 people 

product procurement 

we procure products from suppliers principally using standard purchase orders based on our assessment of market demand we carry inventory quantities that we believe are necessary to provide rapid response to retailer and distributor orders we utilize electronic data interchange with many of our customers to enhance the efficiency of placing and shipping orders and receiving payments 

competition 

in our business we compete with 

• other interactive entertainment companies including those offering mobile games that range in size and cost structure from very small with limited resources to very large with greater financial marketing technical and other resources than ours examples of our competitors include activision blizzard inc electronic arts inc and ubisoft entertainment sa 

• sony microsoft and nintendo for the sale of interactive entertainment software each of these competitors is a large developer and marketer of software for their own platforms and has the financial resources to withstand significant price competition and to implement extensive advertising campaigns 

• other software hardware entertainment and media for limited retail shelf space and promotional resources the competition is intense among an increasing number of newly introduced entertainment software titles and hardware for adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support 

• other forms of entertainment such as motion pictures television social networking online computer programs and other forms of entertainment which may be less expensive or provide other advantages to consumers 

competition in the entertainment software industry is based on innovation features playability product quality brand name recognition compatibility with popular platforms access to distribution channels price marketing and customer service our business is driven by hit titles which require increasing budgets for development and marketing for physical sales competition for our titles is influenced by the timing of competitive product releases and the similarity of such products to our titles and may result in loss of shelf space or a reduction in sellthrough of our titles at retail stores 

international operations 

international sales are a significant part of our business for the fiscal years ended march 31 2021 2020 and 2019 we earned 402 425 and 465 respectively of our net revenue outside the united states we are continuing to execute on our growth initiatives in asia where our strategy is to broaden the distribution of our existing products and expand our online gaming presence especially in china and south korea we are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade including increased credit risks tariffs and duties fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates shipping delays and international political regulatory and economic developments all of which can have a significant effect on our operating results see notes 1 and 2 to our consolidated financial statements

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties which may affect our future financial performance because of the risks and uncertainties described below as well as other factors affecting our operating results and financial condition past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and our business and financial performance could be harmed and the market value of our securities could decline 

risks relating to our business and industry 

our results of operations may be materially adversely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic covid19 

our results of operations may be materially adversely affected by covid19 the global spread of covid19 has created significant uncertainty resulting in volatility and economic disruption the extent to which covid19 has an impact on our business operations or financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict including the duration and scope of the pandemic governmental business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic economic activity and related actions taken in response to the pandemic the effect on consumer demand for our products and the discretionary spending patterns of our customers including the ability of our customers to pay for our products our ability to develop market and sell our products including as a result of travel restrictions and people working from home the impact on the operations of our counterparties including the physical retail digital download online platforms and cloud streaming services we rely on for the distribution of our products the suppliers who manufacture our physical products and other third parties with which we partner eg to market or ship our products any closures of our our customers and counterparties offices and facilities additional volatility in exchange rates the impact of potential inflation and the impact of reductions in interest rates by the federal reserve and other central banks including on our shortterm investment portfolio 

further “shelterinplace” quarantine or other such initiatives by governmental entities could also disrupt our operations in such situations if employees or thirdparty developers who cannot optimally perform their responsibilities from home are not able to or are unwilling to report to work we may experience material interruptions in product development and delays in bringing products to market such circumstances may also impact the effectiveness of our quality controls and game testing measures an increase in the number of employees working remotely also increases the potential adverse impact of risk associated with information technology systems and networks including cyberattacks computer viruses malicious software security breach and telecommunication failures both for systems and networks we control directly and for those that employees and thirdparty developers rely on to work remotely any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or cyber risks or detect or respond adequately to a security breach or cyber risk or any other disruptions to our information technology systems and networks can have adverse effects on our business the spread of covid19 has caused us to modify our business practices including employee travel employee work locations and cancellation of physical participation in meetings events and conferences and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers and business partners further key personnel could contract covid19 hindering their availability and productivity 

additionally sports organizations operations and seasons have and may be altered based on the response to covid19 such events could affect the demand for our sports titles 

while we have developed and continue to develop plans to help mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on our business these efforts may not be effective and a protracted economic downturn may limit the effectiveness of our mitigation efforts any of these considerations described above could cause or contribute to the risks described elsewhere herein and could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or stock price additionally while we have seen increased demand for our products due to stayathome orders the curtailment of certain other forms of entertainment and other pandemicrelated factors that make consumers more inclined to spend time at home benefiting our financial results and operating metrics the trends in fiscal year 2021 with respect to our revenues net income and other financial results and operating metrics may not be indicative of results for future periods particularly if these pandemicrelated factors become less significant 

we are dependent on the future success of our grand theft auto products and we must continue to publish hit titles or sequels to such hit titles in order to compete successfully in our industry 

grand theft auto and certain of our other titles such as red dead redemption or nba 2k  are hit products and have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue grand theft auto products contributed 292 of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2021 and the five bestselling franchises including grand theft auto  which may change year over year in the aggregate accounted for 841 of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2021 if we fail to continue to develop and sell new commercially successful hit titles or sequels to such hit titles or experience any delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of our hit titles or their sequels our revenue and profits may decrease substantially and we may incur losses in addition competition in our industry is intense and a relatively small number of hit titles account for a large portion of total revenue in our industry hit products offered by our competitors may take a larger share of consumer spending than we anticipate which could cause revenue generated from our products to fall below our expectations if our competitors develop more successful products or services at lower price points or based on payment models perceived as offering better value or if we do not continue to develop consistently high quality and wellreceived products and services our revenue and profitability may decline in addition both the online and mobile games marketplaces are characterized by frequent product introductions relatively low barriers to entry and new and evolving business methods technologies and platforms for development widespread consumer adoption of these new platforms for games and other technological advances in andor new business or payment models in online or mobile game offerings could negatively affect our sales of console and traditional pc products before we have an opportunity to develop profitable businesses in such markets 

the interactive entertainment software industry is highly competitive 

we compete for both licenses to properties and the sale of interactive entertainment software with sony and microsoft each of which is a large developer and marketer of software for its own platforms we also compete with game publishers such as activision blizzard inc electronic arts inc and ubisoft entertainment sa as our business is dependent upon our ability to develop hit titles which require increasing budgets for development and marketing the availability of significant financial resources has become a major competitive factor in developing and marketing software games some of our competitors have greater financial technical personnel and other resources than we do and are able to finance larger budgets for development and marketing and make higher offers to licensors and developers for commercially desirable properties our titles also compete with other forms of entertainment such as social media and casual games in addition to motion pictures television and audio and video products featuring similar themes online computer programs and other entertainment which may be less expensive or provide other advantages to consumers 

a number of software publishers who compete with us have developed and commercialized or are currently developing online games as technological advances significantly increase the availability of online games and as consumer acceptance of online gaming grows substantially it could result in a decline in our platformbased software sales and negatively affect sales of such products 

additionally we compete with other forms of entertainment and leisure activities while we monitor general market conditions significant shifts in consumer demand that could materially alter public preferences for different forms of entertainment and leisure activities are difficult to predict failure to adequately identify and adapt to these competitive pressures could have a negative impact on our business 

we are subject to product development risks which could result in delays and additional costs and we must adapt to changes in software technologies 

we depend on our internal development studios and thirdparty software developers to develop new interactive entertainment software within anticipated release schedules and cost projections the development cycle for new titles generally ranges from 12 months for annual sports releases to multiple years for certain of our topselling titles therefore our development costs can be substantial if we or our thirdparty developers experience unanticipated development delays financial difficulties or additional costs for example as a result of covid19 we may not be able to release titles according to our schedule and at budgeted costs there can be no assurance that our products will be sufficiently successful so that we can recoup these costs or make a profit on these products 

additionally in order to stay competitive our internal development studios must anticipate and adapt to rapid technological changes affecting software development such as cloudbased game streaming any inability to respond to technological advances and implement new technologies could render our products obsolete or less marketable further the failure to pursue the development of new technology platforms or business models that obtain meaningful commercial success in a timely manner may negatively affect our business resulting in increased production or development costs and more strenuous competition 

the inability of our products to achieve significant market acceptance delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of our products may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

new products may not achieve significant market acceptance generate sufficient sales or be introduced in a timely manner to permit us to recover development manufacturing and marketing costs associated with these products the life cycle of a title generally involves a relatively high level of sales during the first few months after introduction followed by a rapid decline in sales because sales associated with an initial product launch generally constitute a high percentage of the total sales associated with the life of a product delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of one or more new products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results and therefore cause our operating results to be materially different from our expectations 

our business is subject to our ability to develop commercially successful products for the current video game platforms 

we derive most of our revenue from the sale of products made for video game platforms manufactured by third parties such as sonys ps4 and ps5 and microsofts xbox one and xbox series xs which comprised 746 of our net revenue by product platform for the fiscal year ended march 31 2021 the success of our business is subject to the continued popularity of these platforms and our ability to develop commercially successful products for these platforms 

in 2020 sony and microsoft each launched their respective next generation consoles historically when next generation consoles are announced or introduced into the market consumers have typically reduced their purchases of products for priorgeneration consoles in anticipation of purchasing a nextgeneration console and products for that console during these periods sales of the products we publish may decline until new platforms achieve wide consumer acceptance console transitions may have a comparable impact on sales of downloadable content amplifying the impact on our revenues this decline may not be offset by increased sales of products for the nextgeneration consoles in addition as console hardware moves through its life cycle hardware manufacturers typically enact price reductions and decreasing prices may put downward pressure on software prices during console transitions we may simultaneously incur costs both in continuing to develop and market new titles for priorgeneration video game platforms which may not sell at premium prices and also in developing products for nextgeneration platforms which may not generate immediate or nearterm revenues as a result our business and operating results may be more volatile and difficult to predict during console transitions than during other times 

connectivity issues could affect our profitability and our ability to sell and provide online services for our products 

we rely upon thirdparty digital delivery platforms such as microsofts xbox live playstation network steam epic and other thirdparty service providers to provide connectivity from the consumer to our digital products and our online services connectivity issues could prevent customers from accessing this content and our ability to successfully market and sell our products could be adversely affected given the increasing global usage of online platforms in part as a result of the covid19 pandemic the risks of connectivity issues may be heightened in addition we could experience similar issues related to services we host on our internal servers such issues also could affect our ability to provide gamerelated services and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we may experience declines or fluctuations in the recurring portion of our business 

our business model includes revenue that we expect to be recurring in nature such as revenue from our annualized titles and associated services and ongoing mobile businesses while we have been able to forecast the revenue from these areas of our business with greater certainty than for new offerings we cannot provide assurances that consumers will purchase these games and services on a consistent basis furthermore we may cease to offer games and services that we previously had deemed to be recurring in nature consumer purchases of our games and services may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including their level of satisfaction with our games and services our ability to improve and innovate our annualized titles our ability to adapt our games and services to new platforms outages and disruptions of online services the games and services offered by our competitors our marketing and advertising efforts or declines in consumer activity generally as a result of economic downturns for example as a result of covid19 among others any decline or fluctuation in this portion of our business may have a negative impact on our financial and operating results 

we rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business any significant system or network disruption could have a negative impact on our business 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks some of which are within taketwo and some of which are managed or hosted by thirdparty providers all information technology systems and networks are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources including but not limited to cyberattacks computer viruses malicious software security breaches energy blackouts natural disasters terrorism war and telecommunication failures we may also face sophisticated attacks referred to as advanced persistent threats which are cyberattacks aimed at compromising our intellectual property and other commercially sensitive information such as the source code and game assets for our software or confidential customer or employee information which remain undetected for prolonged periods of time information technology system disruptions network failures or security breaches could negatively affect our business continuity operations and financial results these risks extend to the networks and ecommerce sites of console platform providers and other partners who sell or host our content online the risk of such threats may be heightened as a result of an extended period of remote work arrangements due to covid19 along with our partners we have expended and expect to continue to expend financial and operational resources to implement certain systems processes and technologies to guard against cyber risks and to help protect our data and systems however the techniques used to exploit disable damage disrupt or gain access to our networks our products and services supporting technological infrastructure intellectual property and other assets change frequently continue to evolve in sophistication and volume and often are not detected for long periods of time our systems processes and technologies and the systems processes and technologies of our business partners or our thirdparty service providers may not be adequate against all eventualities in addition the costs to respond to mitigate or notify affected parties of cyberattacks and other security vulnerabilities are significant any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or cyber risks or detect or respond adequately to a security breach or cyber risk could result in a loss of anticipated revenue interruptions to our products and services our having to incur significant remediation and notification costs degrade the user experience cause consumers to lose confidence in our products and services and significant legal and financial costs additionally applicable insurance policies may be insufficient to reimburse us for all such losses and it is uncertain whether we will be able to maintain the current level of insurance coverage in the future on reasonable terms or at all 

successful exploitation of our systems can have other negative effects upon the products services and user experience we offer in particular the virtual economies that we have established in many of our games are subject to abuse exploitation and other forms of fraudulent activity that can negatively affect our business virtual economies involve the use of virtual currency or virtual assets that can be used or redeemed by a player within a particular game or service although we have implemented and continue to develop programs reasonably designed to prevent such negative impacts the abuse or exploitation of our virtual economies can include the illegitimate generation and sale of virtual items in black markets these kinds of activities and the steps that we take to address and prevent these issues may result in a loss of anticipated revenue interfere with players’ enjoyment of a balanced game environment and cause reputational harm 

our business could be adversely affected if our consumer data protection measures are not seen as adequate or there are breaches of our security measures or unintended disclosures of our consumer data 

we are collecting and storing consumer information including personal information we take measures to protect our consumer information from unauthorized access or disclosure it is possible that our security controls over consumer information may not prevent the improper access or disclosure of personal information in addition due to the highprofile nature of our products we may draw a disproportionately higher amount of attention and attempts to breach our security controls than companies with lower profile products a security incident that leads to disclosure of consumer information including personal information could harm our reputation compel us to comply with disparate breach notification laws in various jurisdictions and otherwise subject us to liability under laws that protect personal information any of which could result in increased costs or loss of revenue a resulting perception that our products or services do not adequately protect the privacy of personal information could result in a loss of current or potential consumers and business partners in addition if any of our business partners experience a security incident that leads to disclosure of consumer information our reputation could be harmed resulting in loss of revenue 

in addition certain of our products are online enabled the ability of our products to offer online functionality and our ability to offer content through a video game platforms digital distribution channel is dependent upon the continued operation and security of such platforms online network these thirdparty networks as well as our own internal systems and websites and the related security measures may be breached as a result of thirdparty action including intentional misconduct by computer hackers employee error malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers information or our data — including our intellectual property and other confidential business information — or our information technology systems because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures if an actual or perceived breach of our safeguards occurs we may lose business suffer irreparable damage to our reputation andor incur significant costs and expenses relating to the investigation and possible litigation of claims relating to such event 

security breaches involving the source code for our products or other sensitive and proprietary information could adversely affect our business 

we securely store the source code for our interactive entertainment software products as it is created a breach whether physical electronic or otherwise of the systems on which such source code and other sensitive data are stored could lead to damage or piracy of our software in addition certain parties with whom we do business are given access to our sensitive and proprietary information in order to provide services and support our team these third parties may misappropriate our information and engage in unauthorized use of it if we or these third parties are subject to data security breaches we may have a loss in sales or increased costs arising from the restoration or implementation of additional security measures which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results any theft andor unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an event could adversely affect our competitive position reputation brand and future sales of our products our business could be subject to significant disruption and we could suffer monetary and other losses and reputational harm in the event of such incidents and claims 

our efforts to expand into new products and services may subject us to additional risks 

in recent years we have continued to invest in emerging opportunities in interactive entertainment played on mobile platforms including tablets and smartphones and online platforms including social networks we have also grown our product offerings that are available through digital download including virtual currency through our existing franchises such as grand theft auto and nba 2k  as well as through our mobile product offerings we are actively investing to capitalize on these trends in order to diversify our product mix reduce our operating risks and increase our revenue there are risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed there is no assurance that we will be able to attract a sufficiently large number of customers or recover costs incurred for developing and marketing any of these new products or services for example we may offer games that do not attract sufficient purchases of virtual currency which may cause our investments into this product space such as through our acquisitions of social point and playdots to fail to realize the expected benefits external factors such as competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also have an impact on the successful implementation of any new products or services failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we depend on our key management and product development personnel 

our continued success will depend to a significant extent on our senior management team and our relationship with zelnickmedia corporation zelnickmedia our executive chairmanchief executive officer and president are partners of zelnickmedia we are also highly dependent on the expertise skills and knowledge of our key creative personnel responsible 

for content creation and development of our grand theft auto and other hit titles and titles based on other brands we may not be able to continue to retain these personnel at current compensation levels or at all 

the loss of the services of our executive officers zelnickmedia or certain key creative personnel could significantly harm our business in addition if one or more key employees were to join a competitor or form a competing company we may lose additional personnel experience material interruptions in product development delays in bringing products to market and difficulties in our relationships with licensors suppliers and customers which would significantly harm our business failure to continue to attract and retain qualified management and creative personnel could adversely affect our business and prospects 

our quarterly and annual operating results are dependent on the release of hit titles and therefore dependent on the timing of our product releases which may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate significantly 

we have experienced and may continue to experience wide fluctuations in quarterly operating results the release of a hit title typically leads to a high level of sales during the first few months after introduction followed by a rapid decline in sales in addition the interactive entertainment industry is highly seasonal with sales typically higher during the fourth calendar quarter due primarily to increased demand for games during the holiday season demand for and sales of titles in our nba 2k series are also seasonal in that they are typically released just prior to the start of the nba season if a key event or sports season to which our product release schedule is tied were to be delayed or interrupted as has happened as a result of covid19 our sales might also suffer disproportionately our failure or inability to produce hit titles or introduce products on a timely basis to meet seasonal fluctuations in demand could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results the uncertainties associated with software development manufacturing lead times production delays and the approval process for products by hardware manufacturers and other licensors make it difficult to predict the quarter in which our products will ship and therefore may cause us to fail to meet financial expectations 

price protection granted to our customers and returns of our published titles by our customers or sales of used video games may adversely affect our operating results 

we are exposed to the risk of price protection and product returns with respect to our customers our distribution arrangements with customers generally do not give them the right to return titles to us or to cancel firm orders however we sometimes accept product returns from our distribution customers for stock balancing and negotiate accommodations for customers which include credits and returns when demand for specific products falls below expectations we grant price protection and accept returns in connection with our publishing arrangements and revenue is recognized after deducting estimated price protection and reserves for returns while we believe that we can reliably estimate price protection and returns if price protection and return rates for our products exceed our reserves our revenue could decline which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results certain of our larger customers sell used video games which are generally priced lower than new video games if our customers increase their sales of used video games it could negatively affect our sales of new video games 

a limited number of customers account for a significant portion of our sales the loss of a principal customer or other significant business relationship could seriously hurt our business 

a substantial portion of our product sales are made to a limited number of customers sales to our five largest customers during the fiscal year ended march 31 2021 accounted for 784 of our net revenue with sony and microsoft each accounting for more than 100 our sales are made primarily without longterm agreements or other commitments and our customers may terminate their relationship with us at any time certain of our customers may decline to carry products containing mature content the loss of our relationships with principal customers or a decline in sales to principal customers including as a result of a product being rated ao age 18 and over could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results in addition if our customers are subject to pricing pressures due to deteriorating demand for our products competition or otherwise such customers may pass those pricing pressures through to us which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

in addition because some of our customers are also publishers of games for their own hardware platforms and may manufacture products for other licensees such customers may give priority to their own products or those of our competitors accordingly console manufacturers like sony or microsoft could cause unanticipated delays in the release of our products as well as increases to projected development manufacturing marketing or distribution costs any of which could negatively impact our business 

furthermore our customers may also be placed into bankruptcy become insolvent or be liquidated due to economic downturns global credit contractions or other factors for example as a result of covid19 bankruptcies or consolidations of certain large retail customers could seriously hurt our business including as a result of uncollectible accounts receivable from such customers and the concentration of purchasing power among large retailers in addition our results of operations may be 

adversely affected if certain of our customers who purchase on credit terms are no longer eligible to purchase on such terms due to their financial distress or lack of credit insurance which may reduce the quantity of products they demand from us 

increased competition for limited shelf space and promotional support from retailers could affect the success of our business and require us to incur greater expenses to market our titles 

while digital sales are increasingly important to our business for physical sales retailers have limited shelf space and promotional resources competition is intense among newly introduced interactive entertainment software titles for adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support with most and highest quality shelf space devoted to those products expected to be best sellers we cannot be certain that our new products will consistently achieve best seller status competition for retail shelf space is expected to continue to increase which may require us to increase our marketing expenditures to maintain desirable sales levels of our titles competitors with more extensive lines and more popular titles may have greater bargaining power with retailers accordingly we may not be able or we may have to pay more than our competitors to achieve similar levels of promotional support and shelf space similarly as digital sales increase in importance to our business there is increasing competition for premium placements of products on websites such placement is subject to many similar risks as physical shelf space discussed above 

the increasing importance of digital sales exposes us to the risks of that business model including greater competition 

the proportion of our revenues derived from digital content delivery as compared to traditional retail sales may continue to increase the increased importance of digital content delivery in our industry including through subscriptionbased access to a portfolio of interactive content increases our potential competition as the minimum capital needed to produce and publish a digitally delivered game is significantly less than that needed to produce and publish one that is delivered through retail distribution this shift also requires us to dedicate capital to developing and implementing alternative marketing strategies which may not be successful if either occurs we may be unable to effectively market and distribute our products which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results in addition a continuing shift to digital delivery could result in a deprioritization of our products by traditional retailers the increasing importance of digital sales to our business could also result in increasing issues with our digital distribution process including difficulties our distributors have with collecting from consumers and any associated rebates we would owe 

our business is partly dependent on our ability to enter into successful software development arrangements with third parties 

our success depends on our ability to continually identify and develop new titles timely we rely on thirdparty software developers for the development of some of our titles quality thirdparty developers are continually in high demand and those who have developed titles for us in the past may not be available to develop software for us in the future due to the limited availability of thirdparty software developers and the limited control that we exercise over them these developers may not be able to complete titles for us on a timely basis or within acceptable quality standards if at all we have entered into agreements with third parties to acquire the rights to publish and distribute interactive entertainment software as well as to use licensed intellectual properties in our titles these agreements typically require us to make development payments pay royalties and satisfy other conditions our development payments may not be sufficient to permit developers to develop new software successfully which could result in material delays and significant increases in our costs to bring particular products to market software development costs promotion and marketing expenses and royalties payable to software developers and thirdparty licensors have continued to increase and reduce potential profits derived from sales of our software future sales of our titles may not be sufficient to recover development payments and advances to software developers and licensors and we may not have adequate financial and other resources to satisfy our contractual commitments to such developers if we fail to satisfy our obligations under agreements with thirdparty developers and licensors the agreements may be terminated or modified in ways that are burdensome to us and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we cannot publish our titles without the approval of hardware licensors that are also our competitors 

we are required to obtain licenses from certain of our competitors including sony and microsoft to develop and publish titles for their respective hardware platforms our existing platform licenses require that we obtain approval for the publication of new titles on a titlebytitle basis as a result the number of titles we are able to publish for these hardware platforms our ability to manage the timing of the release of these titles and accordingly our net revenue from titles for these hardware platforms may be limited if a licensor chooses not to renew or extend our license agreement at the end of its current term or if a licensor were to terminate our license for any reason or does not approve one or more of our titles we may be unable to publish that title as well as additional titles for that licensors platform during or following a console transition like the one that occurred in 2020 hardware platform manufacturers may seek to change the terms governing our relationships with them termination of any such agreements or disapproval of titles could seriously hurt our business and prospects we may be 

unable to continue to enter into license agreements for certain current generation platforms on satisfactory terms or at all failure to enter into any such agreement could also seriously hurt our business 

we rely on a limited number of channel partners some of whom influence the fee structures for online distribution of our games on their platforms 

we rely on a limited number of channel partners some of whom have retained the right to change the fee structures for online distribution of both paid content and free content including patches and corrections that we license to them for distribution on their platforms such channel partners ability to set or influence royalty rates may increase costs which could negatively affect our operating margins we may be unable to distribute our content in a costeffective or profitable manner through such distribution channel which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

outside of fee arrangements our agreements with our channel partners sometimes give them significant control over other aspects of the distribution of our products and services that we develop for their platform if our channel partners establish terms that restrict our offerings through their channels or significantly affect the financial terms on which these products or services are offered to our customers we may be unable to distribute our product offerings through them or be forced to do so on materially worse financial or business terms in negotiating such various aspects of distribution increased competition for digital “shelf space” has put channel partners in more favorable bargaining positions in relation to such terms of distribution 

we use open source software in connection with certain of our games and services which may pose particular risks to our proprietary software products and services in a manner that could have a negative impact on our business 

we use open source software in connection with certain of our games and the services we offer some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software or make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost the terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by courts and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our use of the open source software if it were determined that our use was not in compliance with a particular license we may be required to release our proprietary source code pay damages for breach of contract reengineer our games discontinue distribution in the event reengineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our game development efforts any of which could harm our business 

we depend on servers and internet bandwidth to operate our games and digital services with online features if we were to lose server capacity or lack sufficient internet bandwidth for any reason our business could suffer 

we rely on data servers including those owned or controlled by third parties to enable our customers to download our games and other downloadable content and to operate our online games and other products with online functionality events such as limited hardware failure any broadbased catastrophic server malfunction a significant intrusion by hackers that circumvents security measures or a failure of disaster recovery services would likely interrupt the functionality of our games with online services and could result in a loss of sales for games and related services an extended interruption of service could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we expect a significant portion of our games to be online enabled in the future and therefore we must project our future server needs and make advance purchases of servers or server capacity to accommodate expected business demands if we underestimate the amount of server capacity our business requires or if our business were to grow more quickly than expected or if internet bandwidth becomes limited for example as a result of covid19related increased worldwide demand our consumers may experience service problems such as slow or interrupted gaming access insufficient server capacity may result in decreased sales a loss of our consumer base and adverse consequences to our reputation conversely if we overestimate the amount of server capacity required by our business we may incur additional operating costs 

because of the importance of our online business to our revenues and results of operations our ability to access adequate internet bandwidth and online computational resources to support our business is critical if the price of such resources increases we may not be able to increase our prices or subscriber levels to compensate for such costs which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we submit our products for rating by the entertainment software rating board esrb in the united states and other voluntary or government ratings organizations in foreign countries failure to obtain a target rating for certain of our products could negatively affect our ability to distribute and sell those games as could the rerating of a game for any reason 

we voluntarily submit our game products to the esrb a usbased nonprofit and independent ratings organization the esrb system provides consumers with information about game content using a rating symbol that generally suggests the 

appropriate player age group and specific content descriptors such as graphic violence profanity or sexually explicit material the esrb may impose significant penalties on game publishers for violations of its rules related to rating or marketing games including revocation of a rating or monetary fines other countries require voluntary or government backed ratings as prerequisites for product sales in some instances we may have to modify our products in order to market them under the target rating which could delay or disrupt the release of our products in addition some of our titles may not be sold at all or without extensive edits in certain countries 

in the us if the esrb rates a game as ao age 18 and older platform licensors may not certify the game and retailers may refuse to sell it in addition some consumers have reacted to reratings or controversial game content by refusing to purchase such games demanding refunds for games that they had already purchased and refraining from buying other games published by us many of our rockstar titles and certain of our 2k titles have been rated m age 17 and older by the esrb if we are unable to obtain m ratings and instead receive ao ratings on future versions of those or similar titles as a result of changes in the esrbs ratings standards or for other reasons including the adoption of legislation in this area our business and prospects could be negatively affected if any of our games are rerated by the esrb or other foreignbased ratings organizations we could be exposed to litigation administrative fines and penalties and other potential liabilities and our operating results and financial condition could be significantly affected 

we have implemented processes to comply with the requirements of the esrb and other ratings organizations and properly display the designated rating symbols and content descriptions nonetheless these processes are subject to human error circumvention overriding and reasonable resource constraints if a video game we publish were found to contain undisclosed pertinent content the esrb could rerate a game retailers could refuse to sell it and demand that we accept the return of any unsold copies or returns from customers and consumers could refuse to buy it or demand that we refund their money this could have a material negative effect on our operating results and financial condition in addition we may be exposed to litigation administrative fines and penalties and our reputation could be harmed which could affect sales of our other video games if any of these were to occur our business and financial performance could be significantly harmed 

content policies adopted by retailers consumer opposition and litigation could negatively affect sales of our products 

retailers including digital storefronts and platform partners may decline to sell interactive entertainment software containing what they judge to be graphic violence sexually explicit material or other content that they deem inappropriate if retailers decline to sell our products based on their opinion that they contain objectionable themes graphic violence sexually explicit material or other generally objectionable content or if any of our previously m rated series products are rated ao we might be required to significantly change or discontinue particular titles or series which in the case of our bestselling grand theft auto titles could seriously affect our business consumer advocacy groups have opposed sales of interactive entertainment software containing objectionable themes violence sexual material or other objectionable content by pressing for legislation in these areas and by engaging in public demonstrations and media campaigns additionally although lawsuits seeking damages for injuries allegedly suffered by third parties as a result of video games have generally been unsuccessful in the courts claims of this kind have been asserted against us from time to time and may be asserted and be successful in the future an increase in the number of lawsuits filed by the families of victims of violence may trigger supplemental governmental scrutiny damage our reputation and negatively affect the sale of our products further in 2019 the world health organization included gaming disorder in the 11th revision of the international classification of diseases leading some to consider legislation and policies aimed at addressing this issue in addition public dialogue concerning interactive entertainment may have an adverse impact on our reputation and our customers willingness to purchase our products 

our results of operations or reputation may be harmed as a result of offensive consumercreated content 

we are subject to risks associated with the collaborative online features in our games which allow consumers to post narrative comments in real time that are visible to other consumers from time to time objectionable and offensive consumer content may be posted to a gaming or other site with online chat features or game forums which allow consumers to post comments we may be subject to lawsuits governmental regulation or restrictions and consumer backlash including decreased sales and harmed reputation as a result of consumers posting offensive content we may also be subject to consumer backlash from comments made in response to postings we make on social media sites such as facebook youtube and twitter 

we face risks from our international operations 

we are subject to certain risks because of our international operations particularly as we continue to grow our business and presence in asia latin america and other parts of the world changes to and compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations may increase our cost of doing business and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals could harm our international and domestic sales in either the us or other countries trade legislation such as a change in the current tariff structures importexport compliance laws or other trade laws or policies could adversely affect our ability to sell or to distribute in international markets additionally cultural differences may affect consumer preferences and as a result some of 

our hit products may not sell as well as they do in the us cultural differences may also require us to modify the content of our products or the method by which we charge our customers if we do not correctly assess consumer preferences in the countries in which we sell our products or respond to other risks related to our international operations it could negatively affect our business 

further the enforcement of regulations relating to mobile and other games with an online element in china remains uncertain and further changes either in the regulation or their enforcement could have a negative impact on our business in china in order to operate in china all games must have regulatory approval a decision by the chinese government to revoke its approval for any of our games or to decline to approve any products we desire to sell in china in the future could have a negative impact on our business 

we incur legal compliance costs associated with our international operations and could become subject to legal penalties in foreign countries if we do not comply with local laws and regulations which may be substantially different from those in the us in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it may be common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by us laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and by local laws such as laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations including those based in countries where practices which violate such laws may be customary will not take actions in violation of our policies any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could have a material adverse effect on our business 

in 2020 the uk left the european union eu brexit subsequently the uk and the eu struck a bilateral trade and cooperation deal governing the future relationship between the uk and the eu the trade and cooperation agreement which took effect on may 1 2021 there remains unavoidable uncertainties and risks to our business related to brexit and the new relationship between the uk and eu which will continue to be developed and defined we are preparing to mitigate those risks with operational and commercial changes to the extent possible and warranted however the legal and regulatory landscape remains uncertain and we have no assurance that such preparations will enable us to avoid a material adverse impact on our business from brexit brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace and replicate for example if there are changes to uk immigration policy as a result of brexit our employees and their ability to move freely between the eu member states for workrelated matters could be affected 

the effects of the uks future trade agreements with the eu or other nations could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and may cause us to lose customers distributors and employees the trade and cooperation agreement sets out preferential arrangements in areas such as the trade in goods and services but does not reach the level of integration that existed while the uk was an eu member state which could have a detrimental impact on our uk growth such a decline could also make our doing business in europe more difficult which could negatively affect sales to consumers of our products without access to the single eu market it may be more challenging and costly to distribute our products in europe 

if we are unable to protect the intellectual property relating to our software the commercial value of our products will be adversely affected and our competitive position could be harmed 

we develop proprietary software and have obtained the rights to publish and distribute software developed by third parties we attempt to protect our software and production techniques under patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as through contractual restrictions on disclosure copying and distribution nonetheless our software is susceptible to piracy and unauthorized copying and third parties may potentially exploit or misappropriate our intellectual property and proprietary information causing significant reputational damage unauthorized third parties for example may be able to copy or to reverse engineer our software to obtain and use programming or production techniques that we regard as proprietary well organized piracy operations have also proliferated in recent years resulting in the ability to download pirated copies of our software over the internet although we attempt to incorporate protective measures into our software piracy of our products could negatively affect our future profitability in addition cheating programs or other unauthorized software tools and modifications that enable consumers to cheat in games harm the experience of players who play fairly and could negatively impact the volume of microtransactions or purchases of downloadable content also vulnerabilities in the design of our applications and of the platforms upon which they run could be discovered after their release this may lead to lost revenues from paying consumers or increased cost of developing technological measures to respond to these either of which could negatively affect our business 

our software is susceptible to errors which can harm our financial results and reputation 

the technological advancements of new hardware platforms result in the development of more complex software products as software products become more complex the risk of undetected errors in new products increases we may need to 

produce and distribute patches in order to repair such errors which could be costly and may distract our developers from working on new products if despite testing errors are found in new products or releases after shipments have been made we may have to consider suspending distribution of defective products or offering refunds and we could experience a loss of or delay in timely market acceptance product returns loss of revenue increases in costs relating to the repair of such errors and damage to our reputation 

if we acquire or invest in other businesses intellectual properties or other assets we may be unable to integrate them with our business our financial performance may be impaired andor we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for such transactions 

if appropriate opportunities present themselves we may acquire or make investments in businesses intellectual properties and other assets that we believe are strategic we may not be able to identify negotiate or finance any future acquisition or investment successfully even if we do succeed in acquiring or investing in a business intellectual property or other asset such acquisitions and investments involve a number of risks including 

• retaining key employees and maintaining the key business and customer relationships of the businesses we acquire 

• cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from an acquired company or business into our organization 

• the possibility that the combined company would not achieve the expected benefits including any anticipated operating and product synergies of the acquisition as quickly as anticipated or that the costs of or operational difficulties arising from an acquisition would be greater than anticipated 

• significant acquisitionrelated accounting adjustments particularly relating to an acquired companys deferred revenue that may cause reported revenue and profits of the combined company to be lower than the sum of their standalone revenue and profits 

• significant accounting charges resulting from the completion and integration of a sizable acquisition and increased capital expenditures including potential impairment charges incurred to write down the carrying amount of intangible assets generated as a result of an acquisition 

• the possibility that significant acquisitions when not managed cautiously may result in the overextension of our existing operating infrastructures internal controls and information technology systems 

• the possibility that we will not discover important facts during due diligence that could have a material adverse effect on the value of the businesses we acquire including the possibility that a change of control of a company we acquire triggers a termination of contractual or intellectual property rights important to the operation of its business 

• the need to integrate an acquired companys accounting management information human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management and timely reporting and the need to implement or remediate controls procedures and policies appropriate for a public company in an acquired company that prior to the acquisition lacked these controls procedures and policies 

• litigation or other claims in connection with or inheritance of claims or litigation risks as a result of an acquisition including claims from terminated employees customers or other third parties and 

• to the extent that we engage in strategic transactions outside of the us we face additional risks including risks related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages currency risks and the particular economic political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries 

future acquisitions and investments could also involve the issuance of our equity and equitylinked securities potentially diluting our existing stockholders the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses writeoffs of goodwill intangibles or acquired inprocess technology or other increased cash and noncash expenses such as stockbased compensation any of the foregoing factors could harm our financial condition or prevent us from achieving improvements in our financial condition and operating performance that could have otherwise been achieved by us on a standalone basis our stockholders may not have the opportunity to review vote on or evaluate future acquisitions or investments 

our ability to acquire and maintain licenses to intellectual property especially for sports titles affects our revenue and profitability competition for these licenses may make them more expensive and increase our costs 

certain of our products are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others for example certain of our 2k products include rights licensed from major sports leagues and players associations similarly some of our other titles are based on licenses of popular entertainment products competition for these licenses is intense if we are unable to maintain and renew these licenses or obtain additional licenses on reasonable economic terms or with significant commercial value our revenue and profitability could decline significantly competition for these licenses may also increase the advances guarantees 

and royalties that we must pay to the licensor which could significantly increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability in addition on certain intellectual property licenses we are subject to guaranteed minimum payments royalties or standards of performance and may not be able to terminate these agreements prior to their stated expiration if such licensed products do not generate revenues in excess of such minimum guarantees our profitability will be adversely affected 

we are or may be subject to contractual covenants which place certain limitations on how we manage our business  

our credit agreement the credit agreement may limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt paying dividends repurchasing shares and acquiring or disposing of assets or businesses accordingly we may be restricted from taking actions that management believes would be desirable and in the best interests of us and our stockholders our credit agreement also requires us to satisfy specified financial covenants and comply with other affirmative and negative covenants a breach of any of the covenants contained in our credit agreement could result in an event of default which would allow our lenders to pursue various remedies including accelerating the repayment of any outstanding indebtedness under our credit agreement 

risks related to legal or regulatory compliance 

the laws and regulations concerning data privacy and certain other aspects of our business are continually evolving failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business 

we are subject to certain privacy and data protection laws including those in the us certain activities related to processing the personal data of individuals in the eu are conducted by our ukbased data controller or our local entities in the eu the us childrens online privacy protection act also regulates the collection use and disclosure of personal information from children under 13 years of age failure to comply with privacy and data protection laws or age restrictions may increase our costs subject us to expensive and distracting government investigations and result in substantial fines or result in lawsuits and claims against us to the extent these laws include a private right of action 

privacy and data protection laws and industry terms are rapidly changing and likely will continue to do so for the foreseeable future which could have an impact on our approach to operating and marketing our games and which may harm the sales of our products or decrease the size of our potential audience for example the eu general data protection regulation gdpr and the uk data protection act 2018 dpa 2018 both became effective in may 2018 gdpr and dpa 2018 apply to us because we receive and process the personal information of individuals in the eu and the uk and we maintain certain local entities in the eu and the uk responsible for processing personal information gdpr and dpa 2018 contain significant penalties for noncompliance countries in the eu are still enacting national laws that correspond to certain portions of the gdpr the uk also implemented an age appropriate design code that applies to how personal data is used for individuals up to age 18 in the us the california consumer privacy act ccpa became effective on january 1 2020 and applies to processing of personal information of california residents california also enacted the california privacy rights act cpra which updates the ccpa and virginia enacted the consumer data protection act both effective january 1 2023 other states including nevada have enacted or are considering similar privacy or data protection laws that may apply to us the us government including the federal trade commission and the department of commerce also continue to review the need for greater or different regulation over the collection of personal information and information about consumer behavior on the internet and on mobile devices and the us congress is considering a number of legislative proposals to regulate in this area various government and consumer agencies worldwide have also called for new regulation and changes in industry practices further and most notably in the mobile ecosystem companies that provide the platforms on which our games are played are changing the terms on how publishers can collect and use personal data obtained from users on those platforms 

player use of our games is subject to our privacy policy end user license agreements eula and terms of service if we fail to comply with our posted privacy policy eula or terms of service or if we fail to comply with existing privacy or data protection laws and regulations it could result in proceedings or litigation against us by governmental authorities or others which could result in fines or judgments against us damage our reputation affect our financial condition and harm our business if regulators the media or consumers raise any concerns about our privacy and data protection or consumer protection practices even if unfounded this could also result in fines or judgments against us damage our reputation negatively affect our financial condition and damage our business 

it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted or construed to apply to us in the us and elsewhere that could restrict the interactive entertainment industry including player privacy advertising taxation content suitability copyright distribution and antitrust furthermore the growth and development of electronic commerce and virtual goods may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on companies such as ours conducting business through digital sales any such changes would require us to devote legal and other resources to address such regulation for example existing laws or new laws regarding the regulation of currency banking institutions and unclaimed property may be interpreted to cover virtual currency or virtual goods if that were to occur we may be required to 

seek licenses authorizations or approvals from relevant regulators the granting of which may be dependent on us meeting certain capital and other requirements and we may be subject to additional regulation and oversight all of which could significantly increase our operating costs changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the us or elsewhere regarding these activities may lessen the growth of the interactive entertainment industry and impair our business financial condition and operating results further in 2019 the world health organization included gaming disorder in the 11th revision of the international classification of diseases leading some to consider legislation and policies aimed at mitigating the overuse of and overspending within video games 

although we have structured and operate our skill tournaments and game mechanics including random digital item mechanics with applicable laws in mind including any applicable laws relating to gambling and believe that playing these games does not constitute gambling our skill tournaments or game mechanics could become subject to gamblingrelated rules and regulations or be deemed violative of current rules and regulations and expose us to civil and criminal penalties we also sometimes offer consumers of our online and casual games various types of contests and promotional opportunities we are subject to laws in a number of jurisdictions concerning the operation and offering of such activities and games many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business further random digital item mechanics may become subject to regulations in various jurisdictions if these were to occur we might be required to seek licenses authorizations or approvals from relevant regulators the granting of which may be dependent on us meeting certain capital and other requirements and we may be subject to additional regulation and oversight such as reporting to regulators all of which could significantly increase our operating costs moreover the inclusion of random digital item mechanics has attracted the attention of the interactive gaming community and if the future implementation of these features creates a negative perception of gameplay fairness or other negative perceptions our reputation and brand could be harmed and revenue could be negatively impacted changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the us the eu or elsewhere regarding these activities may lessen the growth of online or casual game services and impair our business also existing laws or new laws regarding the marketing of ingame or inapp purchases regulation of currency banking institutions unclaimed property or money laundering may be interpreted to cover virtual currency or goods 

if we infringe on or are alleged to infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties our business could be adversely affected 

as our industry grows we may be subject to an increasing amount of litigation that is common in the software industry based on allegations of infringement or other alleged violations of patent copyright or trademarks in addition we believe that interactive entertainment software will increasingly become the subject of claims that such software infringes on the intellectual property rights of others with both the growth of online functionality and advances in technology game content and software graphics as games become more realistic from time to time we receive notices from third parties or are named in lawsuits by third parties alleging infringement of their proprietary rights although we believe that our software and technologies and the software and technologies of thirdparty developers and publishers with whom we have contractual relations do not and will not infringe or violate proprietary rights of others it is possible that infringement of proprietary rights of others may occur any claims of infringement with or without merit could be time consuming costly and difficult to defend moreover intellectual property litigation or claims could require us to discontinue the distribution of products obtain a license or redesign our products which could result in additional substantial costs and material delays 

our business and products are subject to potential legislation the adoption of such proposed legislation could limit the retail market for our products 

several proposals have been made for federal legislation to regulate our industry such proposals seek to prohibit the sale of products containing certain content included in some of our games if any such proposals are enacted into law it may limit the potential market for some of our games in the us and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results other countries have adopted laws regulating content both in packaged games and those transmitted over the internet that are stricter than current us laws in the us proposals have also been made by numerous state legislators to regulate and prohibit the sale of interactive entertainment software products containing certain types of violent or sexual content to audiences under the ages of 17 or 18  such as the state of californias ultraviolent video games law that sought to ban the sale or rental of violent video games to minors while such legislation to date has been enjoined by industry and retail groups or been found unconstitutional the adoption into law of such legislation in federal andor in state jurisdictions in which we do significant business could severely limit the retail market for some of our games 

change in government regulations relating to the internet could have a negative impact on our business 

we rely on our consumers access to significant levels of internet bandwidth for the sale and digital delivery of our content and the functionality of our games with online features changes in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth popularity or use of the internet including laws affecting net neutrality or measures enacted in certain jurisdictions as a result of the covid19 pandemic could decrease the demand for our products and services or increase our cost of doing business 

although certain jurisdictions have implemented laws and regulations intended to prevent internet service providers from discriminating against particular types of legal traffic on their networks other jurisdictions may lack such laws and regulations or repeal existing laws or regulations for example on december 14 2017 the federal communications commission voted to repeal net neutrality regulations in the us and following that decision several states enacted net neutrality regulations given uncertainty around these rules including changing interpretations amendments or repeal coupled with the potentially significant political and economic power of local internet service providers and the relatively significant level of internet bandwidth access our products and services require we could experience discriminatory or anticompetitive practices that could impede our growth cause us to incur additional expenses or otherwise negatively affect our business 

risks related to financial and economic condition 

declines in consumer spending and other adverse changes in the economy could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

most of our products involve discretionary spending on the part of consumers we believe that consumer spending is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income this makes our products particularly sensitive to general economic conditions and economic cycles as consumers are generally more willing to make discretionary purchases including purchases of products like ours during periods in which favorable economic conditions prevail adverse economic conditions such as a prolonged us or international general economic downturn such as those caused by covid19 including periods of increased inflation unemployment levels tax rates interest rates energy prices or declining consumer confidence could also reduce consumer spending reduced consumer spending has and may in the future continue to result in reduced demand for our products and may also require increased selling and promotional expenses which has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results in addition during periods of relative economic weakness our consolidated credit risk reflecting our counterparty dealings with distributors customers capital providers and others may increase perhaps materially so as a result of covid19 our counterparty credit risk may be particularly exacerbated as certain of our counterparties may face financial difficulties in paying owed amounts on a timely basis or at all furthermore uncertainty and adverse changes in the economy could also increase the risk of material losses on our investments increase costs associated with developing and publishing our products increase the cost and availability of sources of financing and increase our exposure to material losses from bad debts any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results if economic conditions worsen our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 

we are particularly susceptible to market conditions and risks associated with the entertainment industry which in addition to general macroeconomic downturns also include the popularity price and timing of our products changes in consumer demographics the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment and leisure and critical reviews and public tastes and preferences which may change rapidly and cannot necessarily be predicted 

changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 

we are a multinational corporation with operations in the us and various other jurisdictions around the world accordingly we are subject to tax in the us and in various other jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are required to estimate future taxes although we currently believe our tax estimates are reasonable the estimation process is inherently uncertain and such estimates are not binding on tax authorities further our effective tax rate or tax payable could be adversely affected by a variety of factors including changes in the business the mix and level of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets changes in tax elections and changes in applicable tax laws additionally tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities and developments in those audits could adversely affect our income tax provision should the ultimate tax liability exceed estimates our income tax provision and net income or loss could be materially affected 

on march 11 2021 the us enacted the american rescue plan act of 2021 “arpa” which provided numerous tax and other stimulus measures one such measure will expand limitation of compensation deductions for certain covered employees of publicly held corporations beginning in 2027 to also include our next five highly compensated employees it is possible that these changes could have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate tax payments and financial condition in future periods 

in addition numerous countries are evaluating their existing tax laws due in part to recommendations made by the organization for economic cooperation and development’s “oecd’s” base erosion and profit shifting “beps” project although we cannot predict whether or in what form any legislation based on such proposals may be adopted by the countries in which we do business future tax reform based on such proposals may have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate tax payments and financial condition in future periods 

we are also required to pay taxes other than income taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the us and foreign jurisdictions we are regularly under examination by tax authorities with respect to these nonincome taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations changes in our business or changes in applicable tax law or interpretations will not have an adverse effect on our net income or loss and financial condition 

we are subject to risks and uncertainties of international trade including fluctuations in the values of local foreign currencies against the dollar 

sales in international markets primarily in europe have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2021 402 of our net revenue was earned outside the us we are continuing to execute on our growth initiatives in asia where our strategy is to broaden the distribution of our existing products and expand our online gaming presence especially in china and south korea we are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade including increased credit risks tariffs and duties fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates shipping delays and international political regulatory and economic developments all of which can have a significant influence on our operating results many of our international sales are made in local currencies which could fluctuate against the dollar while we may use forward exchange contracts to a limited extent to seek to mitigate foreign currency risk our operating results could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations 

our reported financial results could be adversely affected by the application of existing or future accounting standards to our business as it evolves 

our financial results are reported under the accounting policies promulgated by the sec and national accounting standards bodies and the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies for example standards regarding revenue recognition have and could further significantly affect the way we account for revenue related to our products and services we expect that an increasing number of our games will be supported with material postrelease activities such as content updates and onlineenabled features and we could therefore be required to recognize more of the related revenues for those games over a period of time rather than at the time of sale further as we increase our downloadable content and add new features to our online services user playing patterns can affect our estimate of the service period and we could be required to recognize revenues and defer related costs over a shorter or longer period of time than we initially allocated as we enhance expand and diversify our business and product offerings the application of existing or future financial accounting standards particularly those relating to the way we account for revenue could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results although not necessarily on our cash flows 

delaware law our charter documents and provisions of our debt agreements may impede or discourage a takeover which could cause the market price of our shares to decline 

we are a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders our board of directors has the power without stockholder approval to adopt a stockholder rights plan andor to designate the terms of one or more series of preferred stock and issue shares of preferred stock the ability of our board of directors to create and issue a new series of preferred stock and certain provisions of delaware law our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede a merger takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock which under certain circumstances could reduce the market price of our common stock and the value of any outstanding notes 

general risk factors 

we are subject to risks related to corporate and social responsibility and reputation 

many factors influence our reputation including the perception held by our customers business partners and other key stakeholders our business faces increasing scrutiny related to environmental social and governance activities we risk damage to our reputation if we fail to act responsibly in a number of areas such as diversity and inclusion environmental stewardship supply chain management climate change workplace conduct human rights and philanthropy any harm to our reputation could impact employee engagement and retention and the willingness of customers and our partners to do business with us which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows 

climate change may have a longterm impact on our business 

climate change could result in an increase in the frequency or severity of natural disasters such as earthquakes fires floods or significant power outages and other catastrophic events such events may adversely impact critical infrastructure 

have the potential to disrupt our business our thirdparty suppliers or the business of our customers and may cause us to experience higher attrition losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations 

additional issuances or sales of equity securities by us would dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

we may issue equity or equitybased securities in the future to facilitate acquisitions or strategic transactions to adjust our ratio of debt to equity to fund expansion of our operations or for other purposes to the extent we issue additional equity securities the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders would be reduced the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect its price the sale or the availability for sale of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause the price of our common stock to decline

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

our business 

we are a leading developer publisher and marketer of interactive entertainment for consumers around the globe we develop and publish products principally through rockstar games 2k private division social point and playdots our products are currently designed for console gaming systems and pc including smartphones and tablets we deliver our products through physical retail digital download online platforms and cloud streaming services 

trends and factors affecting our business 

product release schedule our financial results are affected by the timing of our product releases and the commercial success of those titles our grand theft auto products in particular have historically accounted for a significant portion of our revenue sales of grand theft auto products generated 292 of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2021 the timing of our grand theft auto product releases may affect our financial performance on a quarterly and annual basis 

economic environment and retailer performance we continue to monitor economic conditions including the impact of the covid19 pandemic that may unfavorably affect our businesses such as deteriorating consumer demand pricing pressure on our products credit quality of our receivables and foreign currency exchange rates the covid19 pandemic has affected and may continue to affect our business operations including our employees customers partners and communities and there is substantial uncertainty in the nature and degree of its continued effects over time during fiscal year 2021 as in the final quarter of fiscal year 2020 we noted a positive impact to our results that we believe was partly due to increased consumer engagement with our products because of the covid19 related business closures and movement restrictions such as shelter in place and lockdown orders implemented around the world as well as the online accessibility and social nature of our products however we cannot be certain as to the duration of these effects the impact of vaccination efforts or of the lifting of certain restrictions on them and the potential offsetting impacts of deteriorating economic conditions and decreased consumer spending generally we expect that engagement trends will continue to be notably higher than they were prepandemic however as the return to normalcy continues we expect a moderation of the trends that benefited our industry over the past year we have developed and continue to develop plans to help mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on our business such as our transition based on our concern for the health and safety of our teams to working from home for the vast majority of our teams over the last year which to date has resulted in minimal disruption however despite largely positive outcomes to date these efforts may ultimately not be effective and a protracted economic downturn may limit the effectiveness of our mitigation efforts any of these considerations described above could cause or contribute to the risks described above in item 1a of this form 10k and could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or stock price therefore the effects of covid19 may not be fully reflected in our financial results until future periods and at this time we are not able to predict its ultimate impact on our business 

additionally our business is dependent upon a limited number of customers that account for a significant portion of our revenue our five largest customers accounted for 784 715 and 701 of net revenue during the fiscal years ended march 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively as of march 31 2021 and 2020 five customers comprised 776 and 581 of our gross accounts receivable respectively with our significant customers those that individually comprised more than 10 of our gross accounts receivable balance accounting for 692 and 488 of such balance at march 31 2021 and 2020 respectively we had two customers who accounted for 504 and 188 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2021 and two customers who accounted for 294 and 194 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2020 we did not have any additional customers that exceeded 10 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2021 and 2020 the economic environment has affected our customers in the past and may do so in the future including as a result of the covid19 pandemic bankruptcies or consolidations of our large retail customers could seriously hurt our business due to uncollectible accounts receivables and the concentration of purchasing power among the remaining large retailers the covid19 pandemic has led and may continue to lead to increased consolidation as larger better capitalized competitors will be in a stronger position to withstand prolonged periods of economic downturn and sustain their business through the financial volatility certain of our large customers sell used copies of our games which may negatively affect our business by reducing demand for new copies of our games while the downloadable content that we now offer for certain of our titles may serve to reduce used game sales we expect used game sales to continue to adversely affect our business 

hardware platforms we derive most of our revenue from the sale of products made for video game consoles manufactured by third parties which comprised 746 of our net revenue by product platform for the fiscal year ended 

march 31 2021 the success of our business is dependent upon the consumer acceptance of these platforms and the continued growth in the installed base of these platforms when new hardware platforms are introduced such as those released in november 2020 by sony and microsoft demand for interactive entertainment used on older platforms typically declines which may negatively affect our business during the market transition to the new consoles the new sony and microsoft consoles provide backwards compatibility ie the ability to play games for the previous generation of consoles which could mitigate the risk of such a decline however we cannot be certain how backwards compatibility will affect demand for our products further covid19 or other events may impact the availability of these new consoles which may also affect demand we manage our product delivery on each current and future platform in a manner we believe to be most effective to maximize our revenue opportunities and achieve the desired return on our investments in product development accordingly our strategy is to focus our development efforts on a select number of the highest quality titles for these platforms while also expanding our offerings for other platforms such as tablets smartphones and online games 

online content and digital distribution the interactive entertainment software industry is delivering a growing amount of content through digital online delivery methods we provide a variety of online delivered products and offerings virtually all of our titles that are available through retailers as packaged goods products are also available through direct digital download from websites we own and others owned by third parties as well as a large selection of our catalog titles in addition we aim to drive ongoing engagement and incremental revenue from recurrent consumer spending on our titles through virtual currency addon content and ingame purchases we also publish an expanding variety of titles for tablets and smartphones which are delivered to consumers through digital download as disclosed in our results of operations below net revenue from digital online channels comprised 866 of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2021 we expect online delivery of games and game offerings to continue to grow and to be the primary part of our business over the long term 

content release highlights 

during fiscal year 2021 we released new content for a number of our biggest franchises including but not limited to grand theft auto online red dead online borderlands and sid meier’s civilization  our 2k label also released nba 2k21 and pga tour 2k21  

to date we have announced that during fiscal year 2022 rockstar games will release grand theft auto v for the ps5 and xbox series xs private division will release olliolli world digitally and 2k will release nba 2k22 and wwe 2k22  in addition throughout the year we expect our labels to deliver new content for our franchises we will also continue to invest in opportunities that we believe will enhance and scale our business and have the potential to drive growth over the longterm 

fiscal 2021 financial summary 

our net revenue for fiscal year ended march 31 2021 was led by titles from a variety of our top franchises primarily nba 2k grand theft auto online and grand theft auto v red dead redemption 2 and red dead online  borderlands 3  and our wwe 2k franchise  our net revenue increased to 33728 million an increase of 2838 million or 92 compared to the fiscal year ended march 31 2020

at march 31 2021 we had 20602 million of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents compared to 19934 million at march 31 2020 the increase in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents from march 31 2020 was due primarily to net cash provided by operating activities from sales primarily from the previously mentioned titles  partially offset by investments in software development and licenses as well as royalty payments this net increase was partially offset by i net cash used in investing activities primarily related to changes in bank time deposits and net purchases of available for sale securities our acquisition of playdots and purchases of fixed assets and ii net cash used in financing activities which was primarily related to tax payments related to net share settlements of our restricted stock

net revenue earned outside of the united states increased by 436 million and accounted for 402 of our total net revenue in the fiscal year ended march 31 2021 as compared to 425 in the prior year the increase in net revenue outside of the united states was due to an increase in net revenue from grand theft auto online and grand theft auto v our nba 2k franchise and our mafia franchise  partially offset by a decrease in net revenue from red dead redemption 2 and borderlands 3  changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased net revenue and gross profit by 112 million and 75 million respectively in the fiscal year ended march 31 2021 as compared to the prior year

includes stockbased compensation expense which was allocated as follows in thousands 



foreign currency exchange rates increased total operating expenses by 97 million in the fiscal year ended march 31 2021 as compared to the prior year 

selling and marketing 

selling and marketing expenses decreased by 134 million in the fiscal year ended march 31 2021 as compared to the prior year due primarily to 491 million in lower overall marketing expenses due primarily to less spend on borderlands 3 and red dead redemption 2  partially offset by marketing expenses for two dots with no comparable costs in the prior year period the net decrease was partially offset by an increase in personnel expenses primarily due to increased headcount 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses increased by 724 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2021 as compared to the prior year due primarily to increases in i personnel expenses for additional headcount and higher incentive compensation ii charitable contributions made in connection with our covid19 pandemic response and relief efforts iii professional fees related to consulting including for our acquisition of playdots and our offer to acquire codemasters group holdings plc and iv it expenses primarily for cloudbased services

interest and other net 



interest and other net was income of 88 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2021 as compared to income of 385 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2020 the decrease was due primarily to a 286 million decrease in interest income due to lower interest rates 

gainloss on longterm investments net 

gainloss on longterm investments net for the fiscal year ended march 31 2021 was a gain of 396 million compared to a loss of 53 million in the prior year period and was due primarily to the sale of one of our investments see note 4  fair value measurements  

provision for income taxes 

our income tax expense was 889 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2021 as compared to 540 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2020 

when compared to the statutory rate of 21 the effective tax rate of 131 for the fiscal year ended march 31 2021 was due primarily to a 291 million tax benefit from tax credits anticipated to be utilized a 214 million tax benefit from our geographic mix of earnings and 137 million in excess tax benefits from employee stock compensation 

when compared to the statutory rate of 21 the effective tax rate of 118 for the fiscal year ended march 31 2020 was primarily due to a 379 million tax benefit from tax credits anticipated to be utilized 127 million from our geographic mix of earnings 119 million due to a net deferred tax asset arising from a step up in tax basis related to the federal act on tax reform and avh oldage and survivors insurance financing traf enacted in switzerland during the fiscal year discussed below 92 million in changes in unrecognized tax benefits primarily due to audit settlements and 84 million in excess tax benefits from employee stock compensation these benefits were partially offset by tax expense of 198 million from the reversal of net deferred tax benefits relating to the altera case 

the effective tax rate in the current year was higher compared to the prior year primarily due to decreased tax benefits related to the one time creation of the net deferred tax asset related to traf offset by decreased expense associated with the reversal of net deferred tax benefits relating to the altera case 

the accounting for sharebased compensation will increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our sharebased compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return which depends on the stock price at the time of the employee award vesting since we recognize excess tax benefits on a discrete basis we anticipate that our effective tax rate will vary from quarter to quarter depending on our stock price in each period 

we anticipate that additional excess tax benefits or shortfalls from employee stock compensation tax credits and changes in our geographic mix of earnings could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate in the future in addition we are regularly examined by domestic and foreign taxing authorities examinations may result in tax assessments in excess of amounts claimed and the payment of additional taxes we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable tax assessments it is possible that settlement of audits or the expiration of the statute of limitations could have an impact on our effective tax rate in future periods 

on march 11 2021 the american rescue plan act of 2021 “arpa” was signed into law arpa includes several revenueraising and business provisions one such provision that impacts the company is the expansion of the limitation of compensation deductions for certain covered employees of publicly held corporations effective april 1 2027 arpa expanded the limitation to cover the next five most highly compensated employees as of march 31 2021 arpa did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

on march 27 2020 the us enacted the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the cares act which provides numerous tax and other stimulus measures that generally support the us economy the cares act did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

on may 19 2019 a public referendum held in switzerland approved the traf which was effective for us on january 1 2020 the traf abolished preferential tax regimes for holding companies domicile companies and mixed companies at the cantonal level the traf allows the cantons to establish transition rules the implementation of which may be subject to a ruling from the canton for the fiscal year ended march 31 2020 we recorded a deferred tax asset of 453 million offset by a valuation allowance of 334 million arising from the swiss cantonal tax basis stepup 

as of march 31 2021 we had gross unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties of 1676 million of which 626 million would affect our effective tax rate if realized for the fiscal year ended march 31 2021 gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by 333 million 

we are no longer subject to audit for us federal income tax returns for periods prior to our fiscal year ended march 31 2018 and state income tax returns for periods prior to the fiscal year ended march 31 2017 with few exceptions we are no longer subject to income tax examinations in nonus jurisdictions for years prior to fiscal year ended march 31 2016 certain taxing authorities are currently examining our income tax returns for the fiscal years ended march 31 2015 through march 31 2019 

net income and earnings per share 

for the fiscal year ended march 31 2021 our net income was 5889 million as compared to 4045 million in the prior year diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended march 31 2021 was 509 as compared to 354 for the fiscal year ended march 31 2020 diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 1157 million were 16 million higher due primarily to normal stock compensation activity including vests as well as grants and forfeitures in the prior year being fully outstanding in the current year 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary cash requirements have been to fund i the development manufacturing and marketing of our published products ii working capital iii acquisitions and iv capital expenditures we expect to rely on cash and cash equivalents as well as on shortterm investments funds provided by our operating activities and our credit agreement to satisfy our working capital needs 

shortterm investments 

as of march 31 2021 we had 13087 million of shortterm investments which are highly liquid in nature and represent an investment of cash that is available for current operations from time to time we may purchase additional shortterm investments depending on future market conditions and liquidity needs as of march 31 2021 based on the composition of our investment portfolio and actions by central banks around the world to cut interest rates including the us federal reserve in response to the covid19 pandemic and related adverse economic conditions we anticipate investment yields to remain low which would lower our future interest income such impact is not expected to be material to our liquidity 

credit agreement 

on february 8 2019 we entered into an unsecured credit agreement the “credit agreement” that runs through february 8 2024 the credit agreement provides for an unsecured fiveyear revolving credit facility with commitments of 200 million including sublimits for i the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate face amount of up to 25 million and ii borrowings and letters of credit denominated in pounds sterling euros and canadian dollars in an aggregate principal amount of up to 25 million in addition the credit agreement contains uncommitted incremental capacity permitting the incurrence of up to an additional 250 million in term loans or revolving credit facilities loans under the credit agreement will bear interest at a margin of a 0125 to 0750 above a certain base rate 325 at march 31 2021 or b 1125 to 1750 above libor approximately 110 at march 31 2021 which margins are determined by reference to our consolidated total net leverage ratio 

as of march 31 2021 there was 1979 million available to borrow under the credit agreement and we had 21 million of letters of credit outstanding at march 31 2021 we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement 

the credit agreement also includes among other terms and conditions maximum leverage ratio minimum cash reserves and in certain circumstances minimum interest coverage ratio financial covenants as well as limitations on the company’s and each of its subsidiaries’ ability to create incur assume or be liable for indebtedness dispose of assets outside the ordinary course acquire merge or consolidate with or into another person or entity create incur or allow any lien on any of its property make investments or pay dividends or make distributions in each case subject to certain exceptions in addition the credit agreement provides for certain events of default such as nonpayment of principal and interest when due thereunder breaches of representations and warranties noncompliance with covenants acts of insolvency and default on indebtedness held by third parties subject to certain limitations and cure periods 

financial condition 

we are subject to credit risks particularly if any of our receivables represent a limited number of customers or are concentrated in foreign markets if we are unable to collect our accounts receivable as they become due it could adversely affect our liquidity and working capital position 

generally we have been able to collect our accounts receivable in the ordinary course of business we do not hold any collateral to secure payment from customers we have trade credit insurance on the majority of our customers to mitigate accounts receivable risk 

a majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to major retailers including digital storefronts and platform partners and distributors our five largest customers accounted for 784 715 and 701 of net revenue during the fiscal years ended march 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively as of march 31 2021 and 2020 five customers accounted for 776 and 581 of our gross accounts receivable respectively customers that individually accounted for more than 10 of our gross accounts receivable balance comprised 692 and 488 of such balances at march 31 2021 and 2020 respectively we had two customers who accounted for 504 and 188 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2021 and two customers who accounted for 294 and 194 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2020 we did not have any additional customers that exceeded 10 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2021 and 2020 based upon performing ongoing credit evaluations maintaining trade credit insurance on a majority of our customers and our past collection experience we believe that the receivable balances from these largest customers do not represent a significant credit risk although we actively monitor each customers creditworthiness and economic conditions that may affect our customers business and access to capital we are monitoring the current global economic conditions including credit markets and other factors as it relates to our customers in order to manage the risk of uncollectible accounts receivable including as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

we believe our current cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and projected cash flow from operations along with availability under our credit agreement will provide us with sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash requirements for working capital capital expenditures and commitments on both a shortterm and longterm basis our liquidity and capital resources were not materially affected by the covid19 pandemic and related volatility and slowdown in the global financial markets to date for further discussion regarding the potential future impacts of the covid19 pandemic and related economic conditions on our business refer to item 1a risk factors  

as of march 31 2021 the amount of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the us by our foreign subsidiaries was 3211 million these balances are dispersed across various locations around the world we believe that such dispersion meets the business and liquidity needs of our foreign affiliates in addition we expect to have the ability to generate sufficient cash domestically to support ongoing operations for the foreseeable future 

the tax cuts and jobs act as enacted in december 2017 includes a number of provisions which generally establish a territorialstyle system for taxing foreign income of domestic multinational corporations our current intention is to reinvest indefinitely the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and therefore we have not recorded any material tax liabilities associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings 

our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 142 million shares of our common stock under this program we may purchase shares from time to time through a variety of methods including in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws repurchases are subject to the availability of stock prevailing market conditions the trading price of the stock our financial performance and other conditions the program does not require us to repurchase shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time for any reason 

during the fiscal years ended march 31 2021 2020 and 2019 we repurchased zero zero and 37 million shares of our common stock respectively in the open market for 00 million 00 million and 3624 million respectively including 

commissions as part of the program as of march 31 2021 we had repurchased a total of 104 million shares of our common stock under the program and 38 million shares of our common stock remained available for repurchase under the share repurchase program 

our changes in cash flows were as follows 



at march 31 2021 we had 20602 million of cash cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents compared to 19934 million at march 31 2020 the increase in cash cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents from march 31 2020 was due primarily to net cash provided by operating activities from sales primarily from the previously mentioned titles  partially offset by investments in software development and licenses as well as royalty payments this net increase was partially offset by i net cash used in investing activities primarily related to changes in bank time deposits and net purchases of available for sale securities our acquisition of playdots and purchases of fixed assets and ii net cash used in financing activities which was primarily related to tax payments related to net share settlements of our restricted stock 

commitments 

refer to note 15  commit ments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for disclosures regarding our commitments 

capital expenditures 

in fiscal year 2022 we anticipate capital expenditures to be 100 million 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of march 31 2021 and 2020 we did not have any material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial parties such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such we are not exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 

international operations 

net revenue earned outside of the united states is principally generated by our operations in europe asia australia canada and latin america for the fiscal years ended march 31 2021 2020 and 2019 402 425 and 465 respectively of our net revenue was earned outside the united states we are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade including increased credit risks tariffs and duties fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates shipping delays and international political regulatory and economic developments all of which can have a significant effect on our operating results 

fluctuations in quarterly operating results and seasonality 

we have experienced fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results as a result of the timing of the introduction of new titles variations in sales of titles developed for particular platforms market acceptance of our titles development and promotional expenses relating to the introduction of new titles sequels or enhancements of existing titles projected and actual changes in platforms the timing and success of title introductions by our competitors product returns changes in pricing policies by us and our competitors the accuracy of retailers forecasts of consumer demand the size and timing of acquisitions the timing of orders from major customers and order cancellations and delays in product shipment sales of our products are also seasonal with peak demand typically occurring in the fourth calendar quarter during the holiday season for certain of our software products with multiple performance obligations we defer the recognition of our net revenue over an estimated service period which generally ranges from six to fifteen months as a result the quarter in which we generate the highest net bookings may be different from the quarter in which we recognize the highest amount of net revenue quarterly comparisons of operating results are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential loss arising from fluctuations in market rates and prices our market risk exposures primarily include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates relates primarily to our shortterm investment portfolio and variable rate debt under the credit agreement 

we seek to manage our interest rate risk by maintaining a shortterm investment portfolio that includes corporate bonds with high credit quality and maturities less than two years since shortterm investments mature relatively quickly and can be reinvested at the then current market rates interest income on a portfolio consisting of shortterm securities is more subject to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longerterm maturities however the fair value of a shortterm portfolio is less sensitive to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longerterm securities we do not currently use derivative financial instruments in our shortterm investment portfolio our investments are held for purposes other than trading 

as of march 31 2021 we had 13087 million of shortterm investments which included 7299 million of availableforsale securities the availableforsale securities were recorded at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax in stockholders equity we also had 14229 million of cash and cash equivalents that are comprised primarily of money market funds and banktime deposits we determined that based on the composition of our investment portfolio there was no material interest rate risk exposure to our consolidated financial statements or liquidity as of march 31 2021 

historically fluctuations in interest rates have not had a significant effect on our operating results under our credit agreement loans will bear interest at a rate of a 0250 to 0750 above a certain base rate 325 at march 31 2021 or b 1125 to 1750 above libor approximately 110 at march 31 2021 which rates are determined by reference to our consolidated total net leverage ratio changes in market rates may affect our future interest expense if there is an outstanding balance on our line of credit at march 31 2021 there were no outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we transact business in foreign currencies and are exposed to risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates accounts relating to foreign operations are translated into united states dollars using prevailing exchange rates at the relevant period end translation adjustments are included as a separate component of stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheets for the fiscal years ended march 31 2021 and 2020 our foreign currency translation adjustment was a gain of 513 million and a loss of 274 million respectively we recognized a foreign currency exchange transaction gain of 07 million a loss of 36 million and a loss of 05 million for the fiscal years ended march 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively in interest and other net in our consolidated statements of operations 

balance sheet hedging activities 

we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with nonfunctional currency denominated cash balances and intercompany funding loans nonfunctional currency denominated accounts receivable and nonfunctional currency denominated accounts payable these transactions are not designated as hedging instruments and are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts is reported as either assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value are reported in interest and other net in our consolidated statements of operations we do not enter into derivative financial contracts for speculative or trading purposes at march 31 2021 we had 921 million of forward contracts outstanding to buy foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars and 1405 million of forward contracts outstanding to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars all of which have maturities of less than one year at march 31 2020 we had 526 million of forward contracts outstanding to buy foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars and 1220 million of forward contracts outstanding to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars all of which have maturities of less than one year for the fiscal years ended march 31 2021 2020 and 2019 we recorded a loss of 36 million a loss of 10 million and a gain of 168 million respectively related to foreign currency forward contracts in interest and other net on our consolidated statements of operations as of march 31 2021 and 2020 the fair value of these outstanding forward contracts was a loss of 01 million and a loss 00 million respectively and is included in accrued and other current liabilities the fair value of these outstanding forward contracts is estimated based on the prevailing exchange rates of the various hedged currencies as of the end of the period 

our hedging programs are designed to reduce but do not entirely eliminate the effect of currency exchange rate movements we believe the counterparties to these foreign currency forward contracts are creditworthy multinational 

commercial banks and that the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risks there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations which may be more volatile as a result of covid19 for the fiscal year ended march 31 2021 402 of our revenue was generated outside the united states using sensitivity analysis a hypothetical 10 increase in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would decrease revenue by 40 while a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would increase revenue by 40 in the opinion of management a substantial portion of this fluctuation would be offset by cost of goods sold and operating expenses incurred in local currency

our businesses 

our revenue is primarily derived from the sale of internally developed software titles and software titles developed by third parties operating margins are dependent in part upon our ability to release new commercially successful software products and to manage effectively their development and marketing costs we have internal development studios located in australia canada china czech republic hungary india spain the united kingdom and the united states as of march 31 2020 we had a research and development staff of 4488 employees with the technical capabilities to develop software titles for all major consoles pcs and mobile platforms in multiple languages and territories 

agreements with thirdparty developers generally give us exclusive publishing and marketing rights and require us to make development payments pay royalties based on product sales and satisfy other conditions development payments for software titles are typically recoupable against royalties otherwise due to developers based on software sales our agreements with thirdparty developers generally provide us with the right to monitor development efforts and to cease making development payments if specified development milestones are not satisfied we also regularly monitor the level of development payments in light of the expected sales for the related titles

sales 

we sell software titles both physically and digitally through direct relationships with large retail customers including digital storefronts and platform partners and thirdparty distributors our top customers include among others sony microsoft steam gamestop and epic we sell our products globally and have sales operations in australia canada france germany japan the netherlands new zealand singapore south korea spain taiwan the united kingdom and the united states 

we are dependent on a limited number of customers that account for a significant portion of our sales sales to our five largest customers during the fiscal year ended march 31 2020 accounted for 715 of our net revenue with sony and microsoft each accounting for more than 100 of our net revenue during the fiscal year ended march 31 2020 

we also distribute our titles addon content and ingame purchases through direct digital download via the internet to consoles and pcs including smartphones and tablets we view digital distribution as an important growth opportunity for our industry and company however we expect that packaged goods and traditional retailers will continue to be a significant channel for the sale of our products for the foreseeable future particularly for consoles 

marketing 

our marketing and promotional efforts are intended to maximize consumer interest in our titles promote brand name recognition of our franchises assist retailers and properly position package and merchandise our titles from time to time we also receive marketing support from hardware manufacturers in connection with their own promotional efforts 

we market titles by 

• implementing public relations campaigns using social digital online television outdoor and print marketing including certain performance marketing programs we believe that we label and market our products in accordance with the applicable principles and guidelines of the entertainment software rating board or the esrb an independent selfregulatory body that assigns ratings and enforces advertising guidelines for the interactive software industry 

• stimulating continued sales by reducing the wholesale prices of our products to retailers digital storefronts and platform providers at various times during the life of a product price protection may occur at any time in a products life cycle but typically occurs three to nine months after a products initial launch in certain international markets we also provide volume rebates to stimulate continued product sales price protection sales returns and other allowances amounted to 980 million 817 million and 597 million during the fiscal years ended march 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

• employing various other marketing methods designed to promote consumer awareness including social media instore promotions and pointofpurchase displays direct mail cooperative advertising attendance at trade shows as well as product sampling through demonstration software distributed via the internet or the digital online services 

as of march 31 2020 we had a sales and marketing staff of 603 people 

product procurement 

we procure products from suppliers principally using standard purchase orders based on our assessment of market demand we carry inventory quantities that we believe are necessary to provide rapid response to retailer and distributor orders we utilize electronic data interchange with many of our customers to enhance the efficiency of placing and shipping orders and receiving payments 

competition 

in our business we compete with 

• companies that range in size and cost structure from very small with limited resources to very large with greater financial marketing and technical personnel and other resources than ours examples of our competitors include activision blizzard inc electronic arts inc and ubisoft entertainment sa 

• sony microsoft and nintendo for the sale of interactive entertainment software each of these competitors is a large developer and marketer of software for their own platforms and has the financial resources to withstand significant price competition and to implement extensive advertising campaigns 

• other software hardware entertainment and media for limited retail shelf space and promotional resources the competition is intense among an increasing number of newly introduced entertainment software titles and hardware for adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support 

• other forms of entertainment such as motion pictures television and audio social networking online computer programs mobile games and other forms of entertainment which may be less expensive or provide other advantages to consumers 

competition in the entertainment software industry is based on innovation features playability product quality brand name recognition compatibility with popular platforms access to distribution channels price marketing and customer service 

our business is driven by hit titles which require increasing budgets for development and marketing competition for our titles is influenced by the timing of competitive product releases and the similarity of such products to our titles and may result in loss of shelf space or a reduction in sellthrough of our titles at retail stores 

international operations 

international sales are a significant part of our business for the fiscal years ended march 31 2020 2019 and 2018 we earned 425 465 and 413 respectively of our net revenue outside the united states we are continuing to execute on our growth initiatives in asia where our strategy is to broaden the distribution of our existing products and expand our online gaming presence especially in china and south korea we are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade including increased credit risks tariffs and duties fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates shipping delays and international political regulatory and economic developments all of which can have a significant effect on our operating results see notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

segment and geographic information 

see notes 1 2 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

employees

 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties which may affect our future financial performance because of the risks and uncertainties described below as well as other factors affecting our operating results and financial condition past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and our business and financial performance could be harmed and the market value of our securities could decline 

risks relating to our business 

we are dependent on the future success of our grand theft auto products and we must continue to publish hit titles or sequels to such hit titles in order to compete successfully in our industry 

grand theft auto and certain of our other titles such as red dead redemption or nba 2k  are hit products and have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue grand theft auto products contributed 230 of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2020 and the five bestselling franchises including grand theft auto  which may change year over year in the aggregate accounted for 874 of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2020 if we fail to continue to develop and sell new commercially successful hit titles or sequels to such hit titles or experience any delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of our hit titles or their sequels our revenue and profits may decrease substantially and we may incur losses in addition competition in our industry is intense and a relatively small number of hit titles account for a large portion of total revenue in our industry hit products offered by our competitors may take a larger share of consumer spending than we anticipate which could cause revenue generated from our products to fall below our expectations if our competitors develop more successful products or services at lower price points or based on payment models perceived as offering better value or if we do not continue to develop consistently high quality and wellreceived products and services our revenue and profitability may decline in addition both the online and mobile games marketplaces are characterized by frequent product introductions relatively low barriers to entry and new and evolving business methods technologies and platforms for development widespread consumer adoption of these new platforms for games and other technological advances in andor new business or payment models in online or mobile game offerings could negatively affect our sales of console and traditional pc products before we have an opportunity to develop profitable businesses in such markets 

our results of operations may be materially adversely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic covid19 

our results of operations may be materially adversely affected by covid19 the global spread of covid19 has created significant uncertainty resulting in volatility and economic disruption the extent to which covid19 has an impact on our business operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict including the duration and scope of the pandemic governmental business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic economic activity and related actions taken in response to the pandemic the effect on consumer demand for our products and the discretionary spending patterns of our customers including the ability of our customers to pay for our products our ability to develop market and sell our products including as a result of 

travel restrictions and people working from home the impact on the operations of our counterparties including the physical retail digital download online platforms and cloud streaming services we rely on for the distribution of our products the suppliers who manufacture our physical products and other third parties with which we partner eg to market or ship our products any closures of our our customers’ and counterparties offices and facilities additional volatility in exchange rates the impact of potential inflation and the impact of reductions in interest rates by the federal reserve and other central banks including on our shortterm investment portfolio 

further “shelterinplace” quarantine or other such initiatives by governmental entities could also disrupt our operations in such situations if employees or thirdparty developers who cannot optimally perform their responsibilities from home are not able to or are unwilling to report to work we may experience material interruptions in product development and delays in bringing products to market such circumstances may also impact the effectiveness of the companys quality controls and game testing measures an increase in the number of employees working remotely also increases the potential adverse impact of risk associated with information technology systems and networks including cyberattacks computer viruses malicious software security breach and telecommunication failures both for systems and networks we control directly and for those that employees and thirdparty developers rely on to work remotely any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or cyber risks or detect or respond adequately to a security breach or cyber risk or any other disruptions to our information technology systems and networks can have adverse effects on our business the spread of covid19 has caused us to modify our business practices including employee travel employee work locations and cancellation of physical participation in meetings events and conferences and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers and business partners further key personnel could contract covid19 hindering their availability and productivity 

additionally sports organizations operations and seasons may be altered or even canceled based on the response to covid19 such events could affect the demand for our sports titles 

while we have developed and continue to develop plans to help mitigate the negative impact of the outbreak on our business these efforts may not be effective and a protracted economic downturn may limit the effectiveness of our mitigation efforts any of these considerations described above could cause or contribute to the risks described elsewhere herein and could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or stock price 

we are subject to product development risks which could result in delays and additional costs and we must adapt to changes in software technologies 

we depend on our internal development studios and thirdparty software developers to develop new interactive entertainment software within anticipated release schedules and cost projections the development cycle for new titles generally ranges from 12 months for annual sports releases to multiple years for certain of our topselling titles therefore our development costs can be substantial if we or our thirdparty developers experience unanticipated development delays financial difficulties or additional costs for example as a result of the coronavirus pandemic covid19 we may not be able to release titles according to our schedule and at budgeted costs there can be no assurance that our products will be sufficiently successful so that we can recoup these costs or make a profit on these products 

additionally in order to stay competitive our internal development studios must anticipate and adapt to rapid technological changes affecting software development such as cloudbased game streaming any inability to respond to technological advances and implement new technologies could render our products obsolete or less marketable further the failure to pursue the development of new technology platforms or business models that obtain meaningful commercial success in a timely manner may negatively affect our business resulting in increased production or development costs and more strenuous competition 

the inability of our products to achieve significant market acceptance delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of our products may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

new products may not achieve significant market acceptance generate sufficient sales or be introduced in a timely manner to permit us to recover development manufacturing and marketing costs associated with these products the life cycle of a title generally involves a relatively high level of sales during the first few months after introduction followed by a rapid decline in sales because sales associated with an initial product launch generally constitute a high percentage of the total sales associated with the life of a product delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of one or more new products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results and therefore cause our operating results to be materially different from our expectations 

our business is subject to our ability to develop commercially successful products for the current video game platforms 

we derive most of our revenue from the sale of products made for video game platforms manufactured by third parties such as sonys ps4 and microsofts xbox one which comprised 747 of our net revenue by product platform for the fiscal year ended march 31 2020 the success of our business is subject to the continued popularity of these platforms and our ability to develop commercially successful products for these platforms 

in 2020 we expect sony and microsoft to launch their respective next generation consoles although covid19 or other events may impact the timing of release and availability of these new consoles when next generation consoles are announced or introduced into the market consumers have typically reduced their purchases of products for priorgeneration consoles in anticipation of purchasing a nextgeneration console and products for that console during these periods sales of the products we publish may decline until new platforms achieve wide consumer acceptance console transitions may have a comparable impact on sales of downloadable content amplifying the impact on our revenues this decline may not be offset by increased sales of products for the nextgeneration consoles in addition as console hardware moves through its life cycle hardware manufacturers typically enact price reductions and decreasing prices may put downward pressure on software prices during console transitions we may simultaneously incur costs both in continuing to develop and market new titles for priorgeneration video game platforms which may not sell at premium prices and also in developing products for nextgeneration platforms which may not generate immediate or nearterm revenues as a result our business and operating results may be more volatile and difficult to predict during console transitions than during other times 

we may experience declines or fluctuations in the recurring portion of our business 

our business model includes revenue that we expect to be recurring in nature such as revenue from our annualized titles and associated services and ongoing mobile businesses while we have been able to forecast the revenue from these areas of our business with greater certainty than for new offerings we cannot provide assurances that consumers will purchase these games and services on a consistent basis furthermore we may cease to offer games and services that we previously had deemed to be recurring in nature consumer purchases of our games and services may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including their level of satisfaction with our games and services our ability to improve and innovate our annualized titles our ability to adapt our games and services to new platforms outages and disruptions of online services the games and services offered by our competitors our marketing and advertising efforts or declines in consumer activity generally as a result of economic downturns for example as a result of covid19 among others any decline or fluctuation in this portion of our business may have a negative impact on our financial and operating results 

connectivity issues could affect our ability to sell and provide online services for our products and could affect our profitability 

we rely upon thirdparty digital delivery platforms such as microsofts xbox live playstation network steam epic and other thirdparty service providers to provide connectivity from the consumer to our digital products and our online services connectivity issues could prevent customers from accessing this content and our ability to successfully market and sell our products could be adversely affected given the increasing global usage of online platforms as a result of the covid19 pandemic the risks of connectivity issues may be heightened in addition we could experience similar issues related to services we host on our internal servers such issues also could affect our ability to provide gamerelated services and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business any significant system or network disruption could have a negative impact on our business 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks some of which are within taketwo and some of which are managed andor hosted by thirdparty providers all information technology systems and networks are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources including but not limited to cyberattacks computer viruses malicious software security breach energy blackouts natural disasters terrorism war and telecommunication failures we may also face sophisticated attacks referred to as advanced persistent threats which are cyberattacks aimed at compromising our intellectual property and other commerciallysensitive information such as the source code and game assets for our software or confidential customer or employee information which remain undetected for prolonged periods of time information technology system network failures or security breaches could negatively affect our business continuity operations and financial results these risks extend to the networks and ecommerce sites of console platform providers and other partners who sell or host our content online the risk of such threats may be heightened as a result of an extended period of remote work arrangements due to covid19 along with our partners we have expended and expect to continue to expend financial and operational resources to implement certain systems processes and technologies to guard against cyber risks and to help protect our data and systems however the techniques used to exploit disable damage disrupt or gain access to our networks our products and services supporting technological infrastructure 

intellectual property and other assets change frequently continue to evolve in sophistication and volume and often are not detected for long periods of time our systems processes and technologies and the systems processes and technologies of our business partners or our thirdparty service providers may not be adequate against all eventualities in addition the costs to respond to mitigate andor notify affected parties of cyberattacks and other security vulnerabilities are significant any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or cyber risks or detect or respond adequately to a security breach or cyber risk could result in a loss of anticipated revenue interruptions to our products and services cause us to incur significant remediation and notification costs degrade the user experience cause consumers to lose confidence in our products and services and significant legal and financial costs additionally applicable insurance policies may be insufficient to reimburse the company for all such losses and it is uncertain whether we will be able to maintain the current level of insurance coverage in the future on reasonable terms or at all 

successful exploitation of our systems can have other negative effects upon the products services and user experience we offer in particular the virtual economies that we have established in many of our games are subject to abuse exploitation and other forms of fraudulent activity that can negatively affect our business virtual economies involve the use of virtual currency andor virtual assets that can be used or redeemed by a player within a particular game or service although we have implemented and continue to develop programs reasonably designed to prevent such negative impacts the abuse or exploitation of our virtual economies can include the illegitimate generation and sale of virtual items in black markets these kinds of activities and the steps that we take to address and prevent these issues may result in a loss of anticipated revenue interfere with players’ enjoyment of a balanced game environment and cause reputational harm 

our business could be adversely affected if our consumer data protection measures are not seen as adequate or there are breaches of our security measures or unintended disclosures of our consumer data 

we are collecting and storing consumer information including personal information we take measures to protect our consumer information from unauthorized access or disclosure it is possible that our security controls over consumer information may not prevent the improper access or disclosure of personal information in addition due to the highprofile nature of our products we may draw a disproportionately higher amount of attention and attempts to breach our security controls than companies with lower profile products a security incident that leads to disclosure of consumer information including personal information could harm our reputation compel us to comply with disparate breach notification laws in various jurisdictions and otherwise subject us to liability under laws that protect personal information any of which could result in increased costs or loss of revenue a resulting perception that our products or services do not adequately protect the privacy of personal information could result in a loss of current or potential consumers and business partners in addition if any of our business partners experience a security incident that leads to disclosure of consumer information our reputation could be harmed resulting in loss of revenue 

in addition certain of our products are online enabled the ability of our products to offer online functionality and our ability to offer content through a video game platforms digital distribution channel is dependent upon the continued operation and security of such platforms online network these third party networks as well as our own internal systems and websites and the related security measures may be breached as a result of thirdparty action including intentional misconduct by computer hackers employee error malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers information or our data — including our intellectual property and other confidential business information — or our information technology systems because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures if an actual or perceived breach of our safeguards occurs we may lose business suffer irreparable damage to our reputation andor incur significant costs and expenses relating to the investigation and possible litigation of claims relating to such event 

the laws and regulations concerning data privacy and certain other aspects of our business are continually evolving failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business 

we are subject to certain privacy and data protection laws including those in the united states us certain activities related to processing the personal data of individuals in the european union eu are conducted by our united kingdom ukbased data controller or our local entities in the eu the us childrens online privacy protection act also regulates the collection use and disclosure of personal information from children under 13 years of age failure to comply with privacy and data protection laws or age restrictions may increase our costs subject us to expensive and distracting government investigations and result in substantial fines or result in lawsuits and claims against us to the extent these laws include a private right of action 

privacy and data protection laws are rapidly changing and likely will continue to do so for the foreseeable future which could have an impact on our approach to operating and marketing our games for example the eu general data protection regulation gdpr became effective on may 25 2018 replacing data protection directive 9546ec gdpr 

applies to us because we receive and process the personal information of individuals in the eu and we maintain certain local entities in the eu responsible for processing personal information gdpr contains significant penalties for noncompliance countries in the eu are still enacting national laws that correspond to certain portions of the gdpr in the us the california consumer privacy act ccpa became effective on january 1 2020 and applies to processing of personal information of california residents other states including nevada have enacted or are considering similar privacy or data protection laws that may apply to us the us government including the federal trade commission and the department of commerce also continue to review the need for greater or different regulation over the collection of personal information and information about consumer behavior on the internet and on mobile devices and the us congress is considering a number of legislative proposals to regulate in this area various government and consumer agencies worldwide have also called for new regulation and changes in industry practices 

player use of our games is subject to our privacy policy end user license agreements eula and terms of service if we fail to comply with our posted privacy policy eula or terms of service or if we fail to comply with existing privacy or data protection laws and regulations it could result in proceedings or litigation against us by governmental authorities or others which could result in fines or judgments against us damage our reputation affect our financial condition and harm our business if regulators the media or consumers raise any concerns about our privacy and data protection or consumer protection practices even if unfounded this could also result in fines or judgments against us damage our reputation negatively affect our financial condition and damage our business 

it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted or construed to apply to us in the us and elsewhere that could restrict the interactive entertainment industry including player privacy advertising taxation content suitability copyright distribution and antitrust furthermore the growth and development of electronic commerce and virtual goods may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on companies such as ours conducting business through digital sales any such changes would require us to devote legal and other resources to address such regulation for example existing laws or new laws regarding the regulation of currency banking institutions and unclaimed property may be interpreted to cover virtual currency or virtual goods if that were to occur we may be required to seek licenses authorizations or approvals from relevant regulators the granting of which may be dependent on us meeting certain capital and other requirements and we may be subject to additional regulation and oversight all of which could significantly increase our operating costs changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the us or elsewhere regarding these activities may lessen the growth of the interactive entertainment industry and impair our business financial condition and operating results 

although we have structured and operate our skill tournaments with applicable laws in mind including any applicable laws relating to gambling and believe that playing these games does not constitute gambling our skill tournaments could in the future become subject to gamblingrelated rules and regulations and expose us to civil and criminal penalties we also sometimes offer consumers of our online and casual games various types of contests and promotional opportunities we are subject to laws in a number of jurisdictions concerning the operation and offering of such activities and games many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business further some of our online games and other services include random digital item mechanics which may become subject to regulations in various jurisdictions if these were to occur we might be required to seek licenses authorizations or approvals from relevant regulators the granting of which may be dependent on us meeting certain capital and other requirements and we may be subject to additional regulation and oversight such as reporting to regulators all of which could significantly increase our operating costs changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the us the eu or elsewhere regarding these activities may lessen the growth of online or casual game services and impair our business also existing laws or new laws regarding the marketing of ingame or inapp purchases regulation of currency banking institutions unclaimed property or money laundering may be interpreted to cover virtual currency or goods 

security breaches involving the source code for our products or other sensitive and proprietary information could adversely affect our business 

we securely store the source code for our interactive entertainment software products as it is created a breach whether physical electronic or otherwise of the systems on which such source code and other sensitive data are stored could lead to damage or piracy of our software in addition certain parties with whom we do business are given access to our sensitive and proprietary information in order to provide services and support our team these third parties may misappropriate our information and engage in unauthorized use of it if we or these third parties are subject to data security breaches we may have a loss in sales or increased costs arising from the restoration or implementation of additional security measures which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results any theft andor unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an event could adversely affect our competitive position reputation brand and future sales of our products our business could be subject to significant disruption and we could suffer monetary and other losses and reputational harm in the event of such incidents and claims 

our efforts to expand into new products and services may subject us to additional risks 

in recent years we have continued to invest in emerging opportunities in interactive entertainment played on mobile platforms including tablets and smartphones and online platforms including social networks we have also grown our product offerings that are available through digital download including virtual currency through our existing franchises such as grand theft auto and nba 2k as well as through our mobile product offerings we are actively investing to capitalize on these trends in order to diversify our product mix reduce our operating risks and increase our revenue there are risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed there is no assurance that we will be able to attract a sufficiently large number of customers or recover costs incurred for developing and marketing any of these new products or services for example we may offer games that do not attract sufficient purchases of virtual currency which may cause our investments into this product space such as through our acquisition of social point to fail to realize the expected benefits external factors such as competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also have an impact on the successful implementation of any new products or services failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we depend on our key management and product development personnel 

our continued success will depend to a significant extent on our senior management team and our relationship with zelnickmedia corporation zelnickmedia our executive chairmanchief executive officer and president are partners of zelnickmedia we are also highly dependent on the expertise skills and knowledge of our key creative personnel responsible for content creation and development of our grand theft auto and other hit titles and titles based on other brands we may not be able to continue to retain these personnel at current compensation levels or at all 

the loss of the services of our executive officers zelnickmedia or certain key creative personnel could significantly harm our business in addition if one or more key employees were to join a competitor or form a competing company we may lose additional personnel experience material interruptions in product development delays in bringing products to market and difficulties in our relationships with licensors suppliers and customers which would significantly harm our business failure to continue to attract and retain qualified management and creative personnel could adversely affect our business and prospects 

declines in consumer spending and other adverse changes in the economy could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

most of our products involve discretionary spending on the part of consumers we believe that consumer spending is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income this makes our products particularly sensitive to general economic conditions and economic cycles as consumers are generally more willing to make discretionary purchases including purchases of products like ours during periods in which favorable economic conditions prevail adverse economic conditions such as a prolonged us or international general economic downturn such as those caused by covid19 including periods of increased inflation unemployment levels tax rates interest rates energy prices or declining consumer confidence could also reduce consumer spending reduced consumer spending has and may in the future continue to result in reduced demand for our products and may also require increased selling and promotional expenses which has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results in addition during periods of relative economic weakness our consolidated credit risk reflecting our counterparty dealings with distributors customers capital providers and others may increase perhaps materially so as a result of covid19 our counterparty credit risk may be particularly exacerbated as certain of our counterparties may face financial difficulties in paying owed amounts on a timely basis or at all furthermore uncertainty and adverse changes in the economy could also increase the risk of material losses on our investments increase costs associated with developing and publishing our products increase the cost and availability of sources of financing and increase our exposure to material losses from bad debts any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results if economic conditions worsen our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 

we are particularly susceptible to market conditions and risks associated with the entertainment industry which in addition to general macroeconomic downturns also include the popularity price and timing of our products changes in consumer demographics the availability and popularity of other forms of entertainment and leisure and critical reviews and public tastes and preferences which may change rapidly and cannot necessarily be predicted 

changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 

we are a multinational corporation with operations in the us and various other jurisdictions around the world accordingly we are subject to tax in the us and in various other jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are required to estimate future taxes although we currently believe our 

tax estimates are reasonable the estimation process is inherently uncertain and such estimates are not binding on tax authorities further our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by a variety of factors including changes in the business the mix of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in tax elections and changes in applicable tax laws additionally tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities and developments in those audits could adversely affect our income tax provision should the ultimate tax liability exceed estimates our income tax provision and net income or loss could be materially affected 

in addition numerous countries are evaluating their existing tax laws due in part to recommendations made by the organization for economic cooperation and development’s “oecd’s” base erosion and profit shifting “beps” project although we cannot predict whether or in what form any legislation based on such proposals may be adopted by the countries in which we do business future tax reform based on such proposals may increase the amount of taxes we pay and adversely affect our operating results and cash flows 

in the fiscal year ended march 31 2019 we released our valuation allowance on certain us deferred tax assets as a result of a determination that it was morelikelythannot that such deferred tax assets would be realized we will continue to evaluate our ability to realize our us deferred tax assets if future evidence suggests that any changes are required to reflect the amount of our us deferred tax asset that is morelikelythannot to be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance as needed in the appropriate period 

on june 21 2018 the us supreme court issued its decision in south dakota v wayfair which overturned previous case law that precluded states from requiring retailers to collect and remit sales tax on sales made to instate customers unless the retailer had a physical presence in the state although this case is limited to sales tax collection obligations we continue to monitor the potential impact of this decision on our state income tax footprint 

the ultimate amount of tax payable in a given financial statement period may be materially affected by sudden or unforeseen changes in tax laws changes in the mix and level of earnings by taxing jurisdictions or changes to existing accounting rules or regulations for example on july 27 2015 the us tax court issued an opinion in altera corp v commissioner which concluded that related parties in an intercompany costsharing arrangement are not required to share costs related to stockbased compensation in february 2016 the us internal revenue service appealed the decision to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit on june 7 2019 the ninth circuit reversed the 2015 decision of the us tax court as a result of this decision we are no longer reflecting a net tax benefit within our financial statements related to the removal of stockbased compensation from our intercompany costsharing arrangement the taxpayer in the case requested a rehearing before the full ninth circuit which was denied on november 12 2019 the case remains potentially open for judicial review by the us supreme court as a result the final outcome of the case is uncertain in february 2020 the taxpayer petitioned the us supreme court to review the ninth circuit’s decision and is awaiting the supreme court’s decision as to whether it will hear the case we will continue to monitor ongoing developments and potential impacts to our financial statements 

we earn a significant amount of our operating income and continue to hold a significant portion of our cash outside the us our current intention is to reinvest indefinitely earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and therefore we have not recorded any tax liabilities associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings 

the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act subjects a us shareholder to current tax on gilti earned by foreign subsidiaries the fasb staff qa topic no 5 accounting for global intangible lowtaxed income states that an entity can make an accounting policy election either to recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences that are expected to reverse as gilti in future years or provide for the tax expense related to gilti resulting from those items in the year the tax is incurred we have elected to recognize the resulting tax on gilti as an expense in the period incurred 

we are also required to pay taxes other than income taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the us and foreign jurisdictions we are regularly under examination by tax authorities with respect to these nonincome taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations changes in our business or changes in applicable tax law or interpretations will not have an adverse effect on our net income or loss and financial condition 

our quarterly operating results are dependent on the release of hit titles and therefore dependent on the timing of our product releases which may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate significantly 

we have experienced and may continue to experience wide fluctuations in quarterly operating results the release of a hit title typically leads to a high level of sales during the first few months after introduction followed by a rapid decline in sales in addition the interactive entertainment industry is highly seasonal with sales typically higher during the fourth calendar quarter due primarily to increased demand for games during the holiday season demand for and sales of titles in our nba 2k series are also seasonal in that they are typically released just prior to the start of the nba season if a key event or sports season to which our product release schedule is tied were to be delayed or canceled our sales might also suffer 

disproportionately for example the nba season along with several other professional sports leagues have cancelled or delayed their seasons as a result of the covid19 outbreak our failure or inability to produce hit titles or introduce products on a timely basis to meet seasonal fluctuations in demand could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results the uncertainties associated with software development manufacturing lead times production delays and the approval process for products by hardware manufacturers and other licensors make it difficult to predict the quarter in which our products will ship and therefore may cause us to fail to meet financial expectations 

price protection granted to our customers and returns of our published titles by our customers may adversely affect our operating results 

we are exposed to the risk of price protection and product returns with respect to our customers our distribution arrangements with customers generally do not give them the right to return titles to us or to cancel firm orders however we sometimes accept product returns from our distribution customers for stock balancing and negotiate accommodations for customers which include credits and returns when demand for specific products falls below expectations we grant price protection and accept returns in connection with our publishing arrangements and revenue is recognized after deducting estimated price protection and reserves for returns while we believe that we can reliably estimate price protection and returns if price protection and return rates for our products exceed our reserves our revenue could decline which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

increased sales of used video game products could lower our sales 

certain of our larger customers sell used video games which are generally priced lower than new video games if our customers increase their sales of used video games it could negatively affect our sales of new video games and have an adverse influence on our business financial condition and operating results 

a limited number of customers account for a significant portion of our sales the loss of a principal customer or other significant business relationship could seriously hurt our business 

a substantial portion of our product sales are made to a limited number of customers sales to our five largest customers during the fiscal year ended march 31 2020 accounted for 715 of our net revenue with sony and microsoft each accounting for more than 100 of our net revenue during the fiscal year ended march 31 2020 our sales are made primarily without longterm agreements or other commitments and our customers may terminate their relationship with us at any time certain of our customers may decline to carry products containing mature content the loss of our relationships with principal customers or a decline in sales to principal customers including as a result of a product being rated ao age 18 and over could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results in addition if our customers are subject to pricing pressures due to deteriorating demand for our products competitive pressure or otherwise such customers may pass those pricing pressures through to us which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

in addition because some of our customers are also publishers of games for their own hardware platforms and may manufacture products for other licensees such customers may give priority to their own products or those of our competitors accordingly console manufacturers like sony or microsoft could cause unanticipated delays in the release of our products as well as increases to projected development manufacturing marketing or distribution costs any of which could negatively impact our business 

furthermore our customers may also be placed into bankruptcy become insolvent or be liquidated due to economic downturns global contractions of credit or for other factors this risk has been heightened by the covid19 pandemic bankruptcies or consolidations of certain large retail customers could seriously hurt our business including as a result of uncollectible accounts receivable from such customers and the concentration of purchasing power among remaining large retailers in addition our results of operations may be adversely affected if certain of our customers who purchase on credit terms are no longer eligible to purchase on such terms due to their financial distress or lack of credit insurance which may reduce the quantity of products they demand from us 

if our marketing and advertising efforts fail to resonate with consumers our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 

our products are marketed worldwide through a diverse spectrum of promotional programs such as social media advertising digital and online marketing television advertising print advertising retail merchandising website development and event sponsorship our ability to sell our products and services is dependent in part on the success of these programs if the marketing for our products and services fails to resonate with consumers particularly during the holiday season or other key selling periods or if advertising rates or other media placement costs increase these factors could have a material adverse influence on our business financial condition and operating results 

the interactive entertainment software industry is highly competitive 

we compete for both licenses to properties and the sale of interactive entertainment software with sony and microsoft each of which is a large developer and marketer of software for its own platforms we also compete with game publishers such as activision blizzard inc electronic arts inc and ubisoft entertainment sa as our business is dependent upon our ability to develop hit titles which require increasing budgets for development and marketing the availability of significant financial resources has become a major competitive factor in developing and marketing software games some of our competitors have greater financial technical personnel and other resources than we do and are able to finance larger budgets for development and marketing and make higher offers to licensors and developers for commercially desirable properties our titles also compete with other forms of entertainment such as social media and casual games in addition to motion pictures television and audio and video products featuring similar themes online computer programs and other entertainment which may be less expensive or provide other advantages to consumers 

a number of software publishers who compete with us have developed and commercialized or are currently developing online games if technological advances significantly increase the availability of online games and if consumer acceptance of online gaming grows substantially it could result in a decline in our platformbased software sales and negatively affect sales of such products 

additionally we compete with other forms of entertainment and leisure activities while we monitor general market conditions significant shifts in consumer demand that could materially alter public preferences for different forms of entertainment and leisure activities are difficult to predict failure to adequately identify and adapt to these competitive pressures could have a negative impact on our business 

increased competition for limited shelf space and promotional support from retailers could affect the success of our business and require us to incur greater expenses to market our titles 

while digital sales are increasingly important to our business for physical sales retailers have limited shelf space and promotional resources competition is intense among newly introduced interactive entertainment software titles for adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support with most and highest quality shelf space devoted to those products expected to be best sellers we cannot be certain that our new products will consistently achieve best seller status competition for retail shelf space is expected to continue to increase which may require us to increase our marketing expenditures to maintain desirable sales levels of our titles competitors with more extensive lines and more popular titles may have greater bargaining power with retailers accordingly we may not be able or we may have to pay more than our competitors to achieve similar levels of promotional support and shelf space similarly as digital sales increase in importance to our business there is increasing competition for premium placements of products on websites such placement is subject to many similar risks as physical shelf space discussed above 

the increasing importance of digital sales to our business exposes us to the risks of that business model including greater competition 

the proportion of our revenues derived from digital content delivery as compared to traditional retail sales may continue to increase the increased importance of digital content delivery in our industry including through subscriptionbased access to a portfolio of interactive content increases our potential competition as the minimum capital needed to produce and publish a digitally delivered game is significantly less than that needed to produce and publish one that is purchased through retail distribution this will also require us to dedicate capital to developing and implementing alternative marketing strategies which we may not do successfully if either occurs we may be unable to effectively market and distribute our products which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results in addition a continuing shift to digital delivery could result in a deprioritization of our products by traditional retailers the increasing importance of digital sales to our business could also result in increasing issues with our digital distribution process including difficulties our distributors have with collecting from consumers and any associated rebates we would owe 

our business is partly dependent on our ability to enter into successful software development arrangements with third parties 

our success depends on our ability to continually identify and develop new titles on a timely basis we rely on thirdparty software developers for the development of some of our titles quality thirdparty developers are continually in high demand software developers who have developed titles for us in the past may not be available to develop software for us in the future due to the limited availability of thirdparty software developers and the limited control that we exercise over them these developers may not be able to complete titles for us on a timely basis or within acceptable quality standards if at all we have entered into agreements with third parties to acquire the rights to publish and distribute interactive entertainment software as well as to use licensed intellectual properties in our titles these agreements typically require us to make development payments pay royalties and satisfy other conditions our development payments may not be sufficient to permit developers to 

develop new software successfully which could result in material delays and significant increases in our costs to bring particular products to market software development costs promotion and marketing expenses and royalties payable to software developers and thirdparty licensors have continued to increase and reduce potential profits derived from sales of our software future sales of our titles may not be sufficient to recover development payments and advances to software developers and licensors and we may not have adequate financial and other resources to satisfy our contractual commitments to such developers if we fail to satisfy our obligations under agreements with thirdparty developers and licensors the agreements may be terminated or modified in ways that are burdensome to us and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we cannot publish our titles without the approval of hardware licensors that are also our competitors 

we are required to obtain licenses from certain of our competitors including sony and microsoft to develop and publish titles for their respective hardware platforms our existing platform licenses require that we obtain approval for the publication of new titles on a titlebytitle basis as a result the number of titles we are able to publish for these hardware platforms our ability to manage the timing of the release of these titles and accordingly our net revenue from titles for these hardware platforms may be limited if a licensor chooses not to renew or extend our license agreement at the end of its current term or if a licensor were to terminate our license for any reason or does not approve one or more of our titles we may be unable to publish that title as well as additional titles for that licensors platform during a console transition like the one that is expected to occur in 2020 hardware platform manufacturers may seek to change the terms governing our relationships with them termination of any such agreements or disapproval of titles could seriously hurt our business and prospects we may be unable to continue to enter into license agreements for certain current generation platforms on satisfactory terms or at all failure to enter into any such agreement could also seriously hurt our business 

we rely on a limited number of channel partners some of whom influence the fee structures for online distribution of our games on their platforms 

we rely on a limited number of channel partners some of whom have retained the right to change the fee structures for online distribution of both paid content and free content including patches and corrections that we license to them for distribution on their platforms such channel partners ability to set or influence royalty rates may increase costs which could negatively affect our operating margins we may be unable to distribute our content in a costeffective or profitable manner through such distribution channel which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

outside of fee arrangements our agreements with our channel partners sometimes give them significant control over other aspects of the distribution of our products and services that we develop for their platform if our channel partners establish terms that restrict our offerings through their channels or significantly affect the financial terms on which these products or services are offered to our customers we may be unable to distribute our product offerings through them or be forced to do so on a materially worse financial or business terms in negotiating such various aspects of distribution increased competition for digital “shelf space” has put channel partners in more favorable bargaining positions in relation to such terms of distribution 

we may not be able to adequately adjust our cost structure in a timely fashion in response to a sudden decrease in demand 

in the event of a significant decline in revenue we may not be able to dispose of facilities reduce personnel or make other changes to our cost structure without disruption to our operations or without significant termination and exit costs management may not be able to implement such actions in a timely manner if at all to offset an immediate shortfall in revenue and profit moreover reducing costs may impair our ability to produce and develop software titles at sufficient levels in the future 

we use open source software in connection with certain of our games and services which may pose particular risks to our proprietary software products and services in a manner that could have a negative impact on our business 

we use open source software in connection with certain of our games and the services we offer some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software or make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost the terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by courts and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our use of the open source software if it were determined that our use was not in compliance with a particular license we may be required to release our proprietary source code pay damages for breach of contract reengineer our games discontinue distribution in the event reengineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our game development efforts any of which could harm our business 

we depend on servers and internet bandwidth to operate our games and digital services with online features if we were to lose server capacity or lack sufficient internet bandwidth for any reason our business could suffer 

we rely on data servers including those owned or controlled by third parties to enable our customers to download our games and other downloadable content and to operate our online games and other products with online functionality events such as limited hardware failure any broadbased catastrophic server malfunction a significant intrusion by hackers that circumvents security measures or a failure of disaster recovery services would likely interrupt the functionality of our games with online services and could result in a loss of sales for games and related services an extended interruption of service could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we expect a significant portion of our games to be online enabled in the future and therefore we must project our future server needs and make advance purchases of servers or server capacity to accommodate expected business demands if we underestimate the amount of server capacity our business requires or if our business were to grow more quickly than expected or if internet bandwidth becomes limited as a result of covid19 related increased worldwide demand our consumers may experience service problems such as slow or interrupted gaming access insufficient server capacity may result in decreased sales a loss of our consumer base and adverse consequences to our reputation conversely if we overestimate the amount of server capacity required by our business we may incur additional operating costs 

because of the potential importance of our online business to our revenues and results of operations our ability to access adequate internet bandwidth and online computational resources to support our business is critical if the price of such resources increases we may not be able to increase our prices or subscriber levels to compensate for such costs which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we submit our products for rating by the entertainment software rating board esrb in the united states and other voluntary or government ratings organizations in foreign countries failure to obtain a target rating for certain of our products could negatively affect our ability to distribute and sell those games as could the rerating of a game for any reason 

we voluntarily submit our game products to the esrb a usbased nonprofit and independent ratings organization the esrb system provides consumers with information about game content using a rating symbol that generally suggests the appropriate player age group and specific content descriptors such as graphic violence profanity or sexually explicit material the esrb may impose significant penalties on game publishers for violations of its rules related to rating or marketing games including revocation of a rating or monetary fines other countries require voluntary or government backed ratings as prerequisites for product sales in some instances we may have to modify our products in order to market them under the target rating which could delay or disrupt the release of our products in addition some of our titles may not be sold at all or without extensive edits in certain countries such as germany 

in the us if the esrb rates a game as ao age 18 and older platform licensors may not certify the game and retailers may refuse to sell it in addition some consumers have reacted to reratings or controversial game content by refusing to purchase such games demanding refunds for games that they had already purchased and refraining from buying other games published by us many of our rockstar titles and certain of our 2k titles have been rated m age 17 and older by the esrb if we are unable to obtain m ratings and instead receive ao ratings on future versions of those or similar titles as a result of changes in the esrbs ratings standards or for other reasons including the adoption of legislation in this area our business and prospects could be negatively affected if any of our games are rerated by the esrb or other foreign based ratings organizations we could be exposed to litigation administrative fines and penalties and other potential liabilities and our operating results and financial condition could be significantly affected 

we have implemented processes to comply with the requirements of the esrb and other ratings organizations and properly display the designated rating symbols and content descriptions nonetheless these processes are subject to human error circumvention overriding and reasonable resource constraints if a video game we published were found to contain undisclosed pertinent content the esrb could rerate a game retailers could refuse to sell it and demand that we accept the return of any unsold copies or returns from customers and consumers could refuse to buy it or demand that we refund their money this could have a material negative effect on our operating results and financial condition in addition we may be exposed to litigation administrative fines and penalties and our reputation could be harmed which could affect sales of other video games we sell if any of these consequences were to occur our business and financial performance could be significantly harmed 

content policies adopted by retailers consumer opposition and litigation could negatively affect sales of our products 

retailers including digital storefronts and platform partners may decline to sell interactive entertainment software containing what they judge to be graphic violence or sexually explicit material or other content that they deem inappropriate for their businesses if retailers decline to sell our products based upon their opinion that they contain objectionable themes graphic 

violence or sexually explicit material or other generally objectionable content or if any of our previously m rated series products are rated ao we might be required to significantly change or discontinue particular titles or series which in the case of our bestselling grand theft auto titles could seriously affect our business consumer advocacy groups have opposed sales of interactive entertainment software containing objectionable themes violence or sexual material or other objectionable content by pressing for legislation in these areas and by engaging in public demonstrations and media campaigns additionally although lawsuits seeking damages for injuries allegedly suffered by third parties as a result of video games have generally been unsuccessful in the courts claims of this kind have been asserted against us from time to time and may be asserted and be successful in the future an increase in the number of lawsuits filed by the families of victims of violence may trigger supplemental governmental scrutiny damage our reputation and negatively affect the sale of our products further in 2019 the world health organization included gaming disorder in the 11th revision of the international classification of diseases icd11 leading some to consider legislation and policies aimed at addressing this issue in addition public dialogue concerning interactive entertainment may have an adverse impact on our reputation and our customers willingness to purchase our products 

our results of operations or reputation may be harmed as a result of offensive consumercreated content 

we are subject to risks associated with the collaborative online features in our games which allow consumers to post narrative comments in real time that are visible to other consumers from time to time objectionable and offensive consumer content may be posted to a gaming or other site with online chat features or game forums which allow consumers to post comments we may be subject to lawsuits governmental regulation or restrictions and consumer backlash including decreased sales and harmed reputation as a result of consumers posting offensive content we may also be subject to consumer backlash from comments made in response to postings we make on social media sites such as facebook youtube and twitter 

we are subject to risks and uncertainties of international trade including fluctuations in the values of local foreign currencies against the dollar 

sales in international markets primarily in europe have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2020 425 of our net revenue was earned outside the us we are continuing to execute on our growth initiatives in asia where our strategy is to broaden the distribution of our existing products and expand our online gaming presence especially in china and south korea we are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade including increased credit risks tariffs and duties fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates shipping delays and international political regulatory and economic developments all of which can have a significant influence on our operating results many of our international sales are made in local currencies which could fluctuate against the dollar while we may use forward exchange contracts to a limited extent to seek to mitigate foreign currency risk our operating results could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations 

we face risks from our international operations 

we are subject to certain risks because of our international operations particularly as we continue to grow our business and presence in asia latin america and other parts of the world changes to and compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations may increase our cost of doing business and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals could harm our international and domestic sales trade legislation in either the us or other countries such as a change in the current tariff structures importexport compliance laws or other trade laws or policies could adversely affect our ability to sell or to distribute in international markets additionally cultural differences may affect consumer preferences and as a result some of our “hit” products may not sell as well as they do in the us cultural differences may also require us to modify the content of our products or the method by which we charge our customers if we do not correctly assess consumer preferences in the countries in which we sell our products or respond to other risks related to our international operations it could negatively impact our business 

the current us administration has voiced concerns about imports from countries potentially engaging in unfair trade practices increased tariffs on certain goods imported into the us from those countries including china and other countries to which we sell products and raised the possibility of imposing significant additional tariff increases the announcement of tariffs and proposed tariffs on imported products by the us has triggered actions from certain foreign governments including china and may trigger additional actions by those and other foreign governments that could have a negative impact on our business further the enforcement of regulations relating to mobile and other games with an online element in china remains uncertain and further changes either in the regulation or their enforcement could have a negative impact on our business in china in order to operate in china all games must have regulatory approval a decision by the chinese government to revoke its approval for any of our games or to decline to approve any products we desire to sell in china in the future could have a negative impact on our business 

we incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our international operations and could become subject to legal penalties in foreign countries if we do not comply with local laws and regulations which may be substantially different from those in the us in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it may be common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by us laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and by local laws such as laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations including those based in or from countries where practices which violate such laws may be customary will not take actions in violation of our policies any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could have a material adverse effect on our business 

on january 31 2020 the uk left the eu “brexit” and entered a transition period expected to last until the end of calendar 2020 during which the uk will continue to be subject to eu rules and regulations while it negotiates the future terms of its relationship with the eu a substantial amount of uncertainty remains regarding the outcome of the ongoing negotiations we continue to assess and monitor the risks our business is likely to face as a result of brexit we are preparing to mitigate those risks with operational and commercial changes to the extent possible and warranted however the legal and regulatory landscape remains uncertain and we have no assurance that such preparations will enable us to avoid a material adverse impact on our business from brexit for example brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace and replicate if there are changes to uk immigration policy as a result of brexit this could affect our employees and their ability to move freely between the eu member states for work related matters 

the effects of the uks future trade agreements with the eu or other nations could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and may cause us to lose customers distributors and employees access to the single eu market and benefits from the eu global trade deals depend on the uks future trade agreements with the eu and the terms of such agreements could have a detrimental impact on our uk growth such a decline could also make our doing business in europe more difficult which could negatively affect sales to consumers of our products without access to the single eu market it may be more challenging and costly to distribute our products in europe 

if we are unable to protect the intellectual property relating to our software the commercial value of our products will be adversely affected and our competitive position could be harmed 

we develop proprietary software and have obtained the rights to publish and distribute software developed by third parties we attempt to protect our software and production techniques under patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as through contractual restrictions on disclosure copying and distribution nonetheless our software is susceptible to piracy and unauthorized copying and third parties may potentially exploit or misappropriate our intellectual property and proprietary information causing significant reputational damage unauthorized third parties for example may be able to copy or to reverse engineer our software to obtain and use programming or production techniques that we regard as proprietary well organized piracy operations have also proliferated in recent years resulting in the ability to download pirated copies of our software over the internet although we attempt to incorporate protective measures into our software piracy of our products could negatively affect our future profitability in addition cheating programs or other unauthorized software tools and modifications that enable consumers to cheat in games harm the experience of players who play fairly and could negatively impact the volume of microtransactions or purchases of downloadable content also vulnerabilities in the design of our applications and of the platforms upon which they run could be discovered after their release this may lead to lost revenues from paying consumers or increased cost of developing technological measures to respond to these either of which could negatively affect our business 

if we infringe on or are alleged to infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties our business could be adversely affected 

as our industry grows we may be subject to an increasing amount of litigation that is common in the software industry based on allegations of infringement or other alleged violations of patent copyright or trademarks in addition we believe that interactive entertainment software will increasingly become the subject of claims that such software infringes on the intellectual property rights of others with both the growth of online functionality and advances in technology game content and software graphics as games become more realistic from time to time we receive notices from third parties or are named in lawsuits by third parties alleging infringement of their proprietary rights although we believe that our software and technologies and the software and technologies of thirdparty developers and publishers with whom we have contractual relations do not and will not infringe or violate proprietary rights of others it is possible that infringement of proprietary rights of others may occur any claims of infringement with or without merit could be time consuming costly and difficult to defend moreover intellectual property litigation or claims could require us to discontinue the distribution of products obtain a license or redesign our products which could result in additional substantial costs and material delays 

our software is susceptible to errors which can harm our financial results and reputation 

the technological advancements of new hardware platforms result in the development of more complex software products as software products become more complex the risk of undetected errors in new products increases we may need to produce and distribute patches in order to repair such errors which could be costly and may distract our developers from working on new products if despite testing errors are found in new products or releases after shipments have been made we may have to consider suspending distribution of defective products or offering refunds and we could experience a loss of or delay in timely market acceptance product returns loss of revenue increases in costs relating to the repair of such errors and damage to our reputation 

if we acquire or invest in other businesses intellectual properties or other assets we may be unable to integrate them with our business our financial performance may be impaired andor we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for such transactions 

if appropriate opportunities present themselves we may acquire or make investments in businesses intellectual properties and other assets that we believe are strategic we may not be able to identify negotiate or finance any future acquisition or investment successfully even if we do succeed in acquiring or investing in a business intellectual property or other asset such acquisitions and investments involve a number of risks including 

• retaining key employees and maintaining the key business and customer relationships of the businesses we acquire 

• cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from an acquired company or business into our organization 

• the possibility that the combined company would not achieve the expected benefits including any anticipated operating and product synergies of the acquisition as quickly as anticipated or that the costs of or operational difficulties arising from an acquisition would be greater than anticipated 

• significant acquisitionrelated accounting adjustments particularly relating to an acquired companys deferred revenue that may cause reported revenue and profits of the combined company to be lower than the sum of their standalone revenue and profits 

• significant accounting charges resulting from the completion and integration of a sizable acquisition and increased capital expenditures including potential impairment charges incurred to write down the carrying amount of intangible assets generated as a result of an acquisition 

• the possibility that significant acquisitions when not managed cautiously may result in the overextension of our existing operating infrastructures internal controls and information technology systems 

• the possibility that we will not discover important facts during due diligence that could have a material adverse effect on the value of the businesses we acquire including the possibility that a change of control of a company we acquire triggers a termination of contractual or intellectual property rights important to the operation of its business 

• the need to integrate an acquired companys accounting management information human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management and timely reporting and the need to implement or remediate controls procedures and policies appropriate for a public company in an acquired company that prior to the acquisition lacked these controls procedures and policies 

• litigation or other claims in connection with or inheritance of claims or litigation risks as a result of an acquisition including claims from terminated employees customers or other third parties and 

• to the extent that we engage in strategic transactions outside of the us we face additional risks including risks related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages currency risks and the particular economic political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries 

future acquisitions and investments could also involve the issuance of our equity and equitylinked securities potentially diluting our existing stockholders the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses writeoffs of goodwill intangibles or acquired inprocess technology or other increased cash and noncash expenses such as stockbased compensation any of the foregoing factors could harm our financial condition or prevent us from achieving improvements in our financial condition and operating performance that could have otherwise been achieved by us on a standalone basis our stockholders may not have the opportunity to review vote on or evaluate future acquisitions or investments 

our ability to acquire and maintain licenses to intellectual property especially for sports titles affects our revenue and profitability competition for these licenses may make them more expensive and increase our costs 

certain of our products are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others for example certain of our 2k products include rights licensed from major sports leagues and players associations similarly some of our other titles are based on licenses of popular entertainment products competition for these licenses is intense if we are unable to maintain and renew these licenses or obtain additional licenses on reasonable economic terms or with significant commercial value our revenue and profitability could decline significantly competition for these licenses may also increase the advances guarantees and royalties that we must pay to the licensor which could significantly increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability in addition on certain intellectual property licenses we are subject to guaranteed minimum payments royalties or standards of performance and may not be able to terminate these agreements prior to their stated expiration if such licensed products do not generate revenues in excess of such minimum guarantees our profitability will be adversely affected 

we are subject to contractual covenants which place certain limitations on how we manage our business  

our credit agreement the credit agreement may limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt paying dividends repurchasing shares and acquiring or disposing of assets or businesses in addition we have granted a security interest in connection with certain compensatory arrangements which limits our ability to incur senior debt in excess of certain amounts accordingly we may be restricted from taking actions that management believes would be desirable and in the best interests of us and our stockholders our credit agreement also requires us to satisfy specified financial covenants and comply with other affirmative and negative covenants a breach of any of the covenants contained in our credit agreement could result in an event of default which would allow our lenders to pursue various remedies including accelerating the repayment of any outstanding indebtedness under our credit agreement 

our business and products are subject to potential legislation the adoption of such proposed legislation could limit the retail market for our products 

several proposals have been made for federal legislation to regulate our industry such proposals seek to prohibit the sale of products containing certain content included in some of our games if any such proposals are enacted into law it may limit the potential market for some of our games in the us and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results other countries such as germany have adopted laws regulating content both in packaged games and those transmitted over the internet that are stricter than current us laws in the us proposals have also been made by numerous state legislators to regulate and prohibit the sale of interactive entertainment software products containing certain types of violent or sexual content to under 17 or 18 audiences such as the state of californias ultraviolent video games law that sought to ban the sale or rental of violent video games to minors while such legislation to date has been enjoined by industry and retail groups or been found unconstitutional the adoption into law of such legislation in federal andor in state jurisdictions in which we do significant business could severely limit the retail market for some of our games 

change in government regulations relating to the internet could have a negative impact on our business 

we rely on our consumers access to significant levels of internet bandwidth for the sale and digital delivery of our content and the functionality of our games with online features changes in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth popularity or use of the internet including laws affecting net neutrality or measures enacted in certain jurisdictions as a result of the covid19 pandemic could decrease the demand for our products and services or increase our cost of doing business although certain jurisdictions have implemented laws and regulations intended to prevent internet service providers from discriminating against particular types of legal traffic on their networks other jurisdictions may lack such laws and regulations or repeal existing laws or regulations for example on december 14 2017 the federal communications commission voted to repeal net neutrality regulations in the us given uncertainty around these rules including changing interpretations amendments or repeal coupled with the potentially significant political and economic power of local internet service providers and the relatively significant level of internet bandwidth access our products and services require we could experience discriminatory or anticompetitive practices that could impede our growth cause us to incur additional expenses or otherwise negatively affect our business 

we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill becomes impaired 

we are required under us generally accepted accounting principles to review our goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating a requirement to reevaluate whether our goodwill continues to be recoverable include a significant decline in stock price and market capitalization slower growth rates in our industry or other materially adverse events we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial 

statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill is determined this may adversely affect our operating results 

our reported financial results could be adversely affected by the application of existing or future accounting standards to our business as it evolves 

our financial results are reported under the accounting policies promulgated by the sec and national accounting standards bodies and the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies for example standards regarding revenue recognition have and could further significantly affect the way we account for revenue related to our products and services we expect that an increasing number of our games will be supported with material postrelease activities such as content updates and onlineenabled features and we could therefore be required to recognize more of the related revenues for those games over a period of time rather than at the time of sale further as we increase our downloadable content and add new features to our online services user playing patterns can affect our estimate of the service period and we could be required to recognize revenues and defer related costs over a shorter or longer period of time than we initially allocated as we enhance expand and diversify our business and product offerings the application of existing or future financial accounting standards particularly those relating to the way we account for revenue could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results although not necessarily on our cash flows 

we are subject to risks related to corporate and social responsibility and reputation 

many factors influence our reputation including the perception held by our customers business partners and other key stakeholders our business faces increasing scrutiny related to environmental social and governance activities we risk damage to our reputation if we fail to act responsibly in a number of areas such as diversity and inclusion environmental stewardship supply chain management climate change workplace conduct human rights and philanthropy any harm to our reputation could impact employee engagement and retention and the willingness of customers and our partners to do business with us which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows 

climate change may have a longterm impact on our business 

climate change could result in an increase in the frequency or severity of natural disasters such as earthquakes fires floods or significant power outages and other catastrophic events such events may adversely impact critical infrastructure have the potential to disrupt our business our thirdparty suppliers or the business of our customers and may cause us to experience higher attrition losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations 

risks relating to our common stock 

for purposes of this section risks relating to our common stock references to the company we our and us refer only to taketwo interactive software inc and not to its subsidiaries 

additional issuances or sales of equity securities by us would dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

we may issue equity or equitybased securities in the future to facilitate acquisitions or strategic transactions to adjust our ratio of debt to equity to fund expansion of our operations or for other purposes to the extent we issue additional equity securities the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders would be reduced the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect its price the sale or the availability for sale of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause the price of our common stock to decline 

there is no guarantee that we will do additional share repurchases in the future 

the share repurchase program authorized by the board of directors which authorized the repurchase of up to 142 million shares of our common stock and had 38 million shares available for repurchase as of the date of this filing does not obligate us to make any purchases at any specific time or situation discontinuing repurchases could adversely affect the price of our common stock the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time for any reason 

our stock price has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly 

the market price of our common stock historically has been and we expect will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us including those discussed in the risk factors in this section as well as others not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material to changes in securities analysts earnings estimates or ratings to our results or future financial guidance falling below our expectations and analysts and investors expectations to factors affecting the computer software entertainment media or electronics industries or to national or international economic conditions such as the impact of covid19 

stock markets in general have experienced over the years and continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected market prices for companies such as ours and that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the affected companies these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock regardless of our operating performance 

delaware law our charter documents and provisions of our debt agreements may impede or discourage a takeover which could cause the market price of our shares to decline 

we are a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders our board of directors has the power without stockholder approval to adopt a stockholder rights plan andor to designate the terms of one or more series of preferred stock and issue shares of preferred stock the ability of our board of directors to create and issue a new series of preferred stock and certain provisions of delaware law our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede a merger takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock which under certain circumstances could reduce the market price of our common stock and the value of any outstanding notes 

our ability to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to reduce future years taxes could be substantially limited under internal revenue code sections 382 and 383 if we experience an ownership change as defined in the internal revenue code section 382 

section 382 of the internal revenue code contains rules that limit the ability of a company to use its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in years after an ownership change which is generally defined as any change in ownership of more than 50 of its stock over a threeyear testing period these rules generally operate by focusing on ownership changes among stockholders owning directly or indirectly 5 or more of the stock of a company andor any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of stock by the company if as a result of future transactions involving our common stock including purchases or sales of stock by 5 stockholders we undergo cumulative ownership changes which exceed 50 over the testing period our ability to use our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards would be subject to additional limitations under sections 382 and 383 

generally if an ownership change occurs the annual taxable income limitation on the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is equal to the product of the applicable longterm taxexempt rate and the value of the companys stock immediately before the ownership change depending on the resulting limitation a portion of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards could expire before we would be able to use them 

our inability to fully utilize any net operating losses or tax credit carryforwards to reduce tax liability in the future could have a material and negative affect on our future financial position and results of operations

trends and factors affecting our business 

product release schedule our financial results are affected by the timing of our product releases and the commercial success of those titles our grand theft auto products in particular have historically accounted for a significant portion of our revenue sales of grand theft auto products generated 230 of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2020 the timing of our grand theft auto product releases may affect our financial performance on a quarterly and annual basis 

economic environment and retailer performance we continue to monitor economic conditions including the impact of the covid19 pandemic that may unfavorably affect our businesses such as deteriorating consumer demand delays in development pricing pressure on our products credit quality of our receivables and foreign currency exchange rates the covid19 pandemic has affected and may continue to affect our business operations including our employees customers partners and communities and there is substantial uncertainty in the nature and degree of its continued effects over time in the final quarter of fiscal year 2020 we noted a positive impact to our results that we believe was partly due to increased consumer engagement with our products because of covid19 related business closures and movement restrictions such as shelter in place and lockdown orders being implemented around the world as well as the online accessibility and social nature of our products however we cannot be certain as to the duration of these effects and the potential offsetting impacts of deteriorating economic conditions and decreased consumer spending generally we have developed and continue to develop plans to help mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on our business such as our transition based on our concern for the health and 

safety of our teams to working from home for the vast majority of our teams which to date has resulted in minimal disruption however these efforts may not be effective and a protracted economic downturn may limit the effectiveness of our mitigation efforts any of these considerations described above could cause or contribute to the risks described above in item 1a of this form 10k and could materially adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or stock price therefore the effects of covid19 will not be fully reflected in our financial results until future periods and at this time we are not able to predict its ultimate impact on our business 

additionally our business is dependent upon a limited number of customers that account for a significant portion of our revenue our five largest customers accounted for 715 701 and 707 of net revenue during the fiscal years ended march 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively as of march 31 2020 and 2019 five customers comprised 581 and 666 of our gross accounts receivable respectively with our significant customers those that individually comprised more than 10 of our gross accounts receivable balance accounting for 488 and 558 of such balance at march 31 2020 and 2019 respectively we had two customers who accounted for 294 and 194 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2020 and two customers who accounted for 401 and 157 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2019 we did not have any additional customers that exceeded 10 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2020 and 2019 the economic environment has affected our customers in the past and may do so in the future including as a result of the covid19 pandemic bankruptcies or consolidations of our large retail customers could seriously hurt our business due to uncollectible accounts receivables and the concentration of purchasing power among the remaining large retailers the covid19 pandemic may lead to increased consolidation as larger better capitalized competitors will be in a stronger position to withstand prolonged periods of economic downturn and sustain their business through the financial volatility certain of our large customers sell used copies of our games which may negatively affect our business by reducing demand for new copies of our games while the downloadable content that we now offer for certain of our titles may serve to reduce used game sales we expect used game sales to continue to adversely affect our business 

hardware platforms we derive most of our revenue from the sale of products made for video game consoles manufactured by third parties such as sonys ps4 and microsofts xbox one which comprised 747 of our net revenue by product platform for the fiscal year ended march 31 2020 the success of our business is dependent upon the consumer acceptance of these platforms and the continued growth in the installed base of these platforms when new hardware platforms are introduced such as those slated for release in calendar 2020 by sony and microsoft demand for interactive entertainment used on older platforms typically declines which may negatively affect our business during the market transition to the new consoles the new sony and microsoft consoles are expected to provide backwards compatibility ie the ability to play games for the previous generation of consoles which could mitigate the risk of such a decline however we cannot be certain how backwards compatibility will affect demand for our products further covid19 or other events may impact the timing of release and availability of these new consoles which may also affect demand we manage our product delivery on each current and future platform in a manner we believe to be most effective to maximize our revenue opportunities and achieve the desired return on our investments in product development accordingly our strategy is to focus our development efforts on a select number of the highest quality titles for these platforms while also expanding our offerings for other platforms such as tablets smartphones and online games 

online content and digital distribution the interactive entertainment software industry is delivering a growing amount of content through digital online delivery methods we provide a variety of online delivered products and offerings virtually all of our titles that are available through retailers as packaged goods products are also available through direct digital download from websites we own and others owned by third parties as well as a large selection of our catalog titles in addition we aim to drive ongoing engagement and incremental revenue from recurrent consumer spending on our titles through virtual currency addon content and ingame purchases we also publish an expanding variety of titles for tablets and smartphones which are delivered to consumers through digital download as disclosed in our results of operations below net revenue from digital online channels comprised 770 of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2020 we expect online delivery of games and game offerings to continue to grow and to become the primary part of our business over the longterm

fiscal 2020 financial summary 

our net revenue for fiscal year ended march 31 2020 was led by titles from a variety of our top franchises primarily nba 2k grand theft auto v and grand theft auto online red dead redemption 2 and red dead online  which released on pc in november 2019 borderlands 3  which released in september 2019 and the outer worlds  which released in october 2019  our net revenue increased to 30890 million an increase of 4206 million or 158 compared to the fiscal year ended march 31 2019

at march 31 2020 we had 19934 million of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents compared to 13920 million at march 31 2019 the increase in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents from march 31 2019 was due primarily to net cash provided by operating activities from sales primarily from the previously mentioned titles  partially offset by investments in software development and licenses as well as royalty payments 

and to a lesser extent net cash from investing activities these net increases were offset by net cash used in financing activities which was primarily related to tax payments related to net share settlements of our restricted stock 

critical accounting policies and estimates

selling and marketing

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses increased by 370 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2020 as compared to the prior year due primarily to increases in i personnel expenses due to additional headcount ii it related expenses for cloudbased services iii indirect tax expenses and iv rent expenses

business reorganization 

during the fiscal year ended march 31 2020 business reorganization expense increased by 50 million due to a benefit in the prior year related to updating estimates for and completing our 2016 plan and updating estimates for our 2018 plan 

interest and other net 



interest and other net was income of 385 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2020 as compared to income of 261 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2019 the increase was due primarily to a 93 million increase in interest income due to the nature of our investments higher invested balances and higher interest rates on those investments 

provision from income taxes 

our income tax expense was 540 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2020 as compared to a benefit of 1011 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2019 

when compared to the statutory rate of 210 the effective tax rate of 118 for the fiscal year ended march 31 2020 was due primarily to a 379 million tax benefit from tax credits anticipated to be utilized 127 million from our geographic mix of earnings 119 million due to net deferred tax asset arising from a step up in tax basis related to the federal act on tax reform and avh oldage and survivors insurance financing traf enacted in switzerland during the fiscal year discussed below 92 million in changes in unrecognized tax benefits primarily due to audit settlements and 84 million in excess tax benefits from employee stock compensation these benefits were partially offset by tax expense of 198 million from the reversal of net deferred tax benefits relating to the altera case discussed below 

when compared to the statutory rate of 21 the effective tax rate of 434 for the fiscal year ended march 31 2019 was primarily due to a 1071 million tax benefit from changes in valuation allowance a benefit of 350 million for tax credits 133 million from excess tax benefits from employee stock compensation and 90 million from our geographic mix of earnings partially offset by tax expense from other immaterial items which include the impact of the tax act 

the effective tax rate in the current year was higher compared to the prior year primarily due to decreased tax benefits from i changes in valuation allowance and ii geographic mix of earnings 

the accounting for sharebased compensation will increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our sharebased compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return which depends upon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting since we recognize excess tax benefits and shortfalls on a discrete basis we anticipate that our effective tax rate will vary from quarter to quarter depending on our stock price in each period 

we anticipate that additional excess tax benefits or shortfalls from employee stock compensation tax credits and changes in our geographic mix of earnings could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate in the future in addition we are regularly examined by domestic and foreign taxing authorities examinations may result in tax assessments in excess of amounts claimed and the payment of additional taxes we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable tax assessments it is possible that settlement of audits or the expiration of the statute of limitations could have an impact on our effective tax rate in future periods 

on july 27 2015 the us tax court issued an opinion in altera corp v commissioner which concluded that related parties in an intercompany costsharing arrangement are not required to share costs related to stockbased compensation in february 2016 the us internal revenue service appealed the decision to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit on june 7 2019 the ninth circuit reversed the 2015 decision of the us tax court as a result of this decision we are no longer reflecting a net tax benefit within our financial statements related to the removal of stockbased compensation from our intercompany costsharing arrangement during the three months ended december 31 2019 we removed the deferred tax asset and a deferred tax liability associated with this matter resulting in a cumulative net discrete income tax expense of 198 million in february 2020 the taxpayer petitioned the us supreme court to review the ninth circuits decision and is awaiting the supreme courts decision as to whether it will hear the case we will continue to monitor the case 

on june 21 2018 the us supreme court issued its decision in south dakota v wayfair which overturned previous case law that precluded states from requiring retailers to collect sales tax on sales made to instate customers unless the retailer had physical presence in the state although this case is limited to sales tax collection obligations we continue to monitor the potential impact of this decision on our state income tax footprint 

on may 19 2019 a public referendum held in switzerland approved the traf which was effective for us on january 1 2020 the tax reform abolished preferential tax regimes for holding companies domicile companies and mixed companies at the cantonal level the traf allows the cantons to establish transition rules the implementation of which may be subject to a ruling from the canton for the three months ended march 31 2020 we recorded a deferred tax asset of 453 million offset by a valuation allowance of 334 million rising from the swiss cantonal tax basis stepup 

on march 27 2020 the us enacted the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the cares act which provides numerous tax and other stimulus measures although we are currently reviewing the potential implications of the cares act we do not expect that it will have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 

as of march 31 2020 we had gross unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties of 1343 million of which 307 million would affect our effective tax rate if realized for the fiscal year ended march 31 2020 gross unrecognized tax benefits decreased by 47 million 

we are no longer subject to audit for us federal income tax returns for periods prior to our fiscal year ended march 31 2017 and state income tax returns for periods prior to the fiscal year ended march 31 2016 with few exceptions we are no longer subject to income tax examinations in nonus jurisdictions for years prior to fiscal year ended march 31 2014 certain taxing authorities are currently examining our income tax returns for the fiscal years ended march 31 2015 through march 31 2018 

net income and earnings per share 

for the fiscal year ended march 31 2020 our net income was 4045 million as compared to 3338 million in the prior year diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended march 31 2020 was 354 as compared to 290 for the fiscal year ended march 31 2019 diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 1141 million were 11 million lower compared to the prior fiscal year due primarily to share repurchases in the last three quarters of fiscal year 2019 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary cash requirements have been to fund i the development manufacturing and marketing of our published products ii working capital iii acquisitions and iv capital expenditures we expect to rely on cash and cash equivalents as well as on shortterm investments funds provided by our operating activities and our credit agreement to satisfy our working capital needs 

shortterm investments 

as of march 31 2020 we had 6440 million of shortterm investments which are highlyliquid in nature and represent an investment of cash that is available for current operations from time to time we may purchase additional shortterm investments depending on future market conditions and liquidity needs as of march 31 2020 based on the composition of our investment portfolio and relatively lower interest rates as a result of the recent actions by central banks around the world including the interest rate cuts by the us federal reserve in response to the covid19 pandemic and related adverse economic conditions we anticipate investment yields may remain low which would lower our future interest income such impact is not expected to be material to our liquidity 

credit agreement 

on february 8 2019 we entered into an unsecured credit agreement the “credit agreement” the credit agreement replaced our existing credit agreement which was terminated on the same day the credit agreement runs through february 8 2024 the credit agreement provides for an unsecured fiveyear revolving credit facility with commitments of 200000 including sublimits for i the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate face amount of up to 25000 and ii borrowings and letters of credit denominated in pounds sterling euros and canadian dollars in an aggregate principal amount of up to 25000 in addition the credit agreement contains uncommitted incremental capacity permitting the incurrence of up to an additional 250000 in term loans or revolving credit facilities loans under the credit agreement will bear interest at a margin of a 0125 to 0750 above a certain base rate 550 at march 31 2020 or b 1125 to 1750 above libor approximately 166 at march 31 2020 which margins are determined by reference to our consolidated total net leverage ratio 

as of march 31 2020 there was 1983 million available to borrow under the credit agreement and we had 17 million of letters of credit outstanding at march 31 2020 we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement 

the credit agreement also includes among other terms and conditions maximum leverage ratio minimum cash reserves and in certain circumstances minimum interest coverage ratio financial covenants as well as limitations on the company’s and each of its subsidiaries’ ability to create incur assume or be liable for indebtedness dispose of assets outside the ordinary course acquire merge or consolidate with or into another person or entity create incur or allow any lien on any of its property make investments or pay dividends or make distributions in each case subject to certain exceptions in addition the credit agreement provides for certain events of default such as nonpayment of principal and interest when due thereunder breaches of representations and warranties noncompliance with covenants acts of insolvency and default on indebtedness held by third parties subject to certain limitations and cure periods 

financial condition 

we are subject to credit risks particularly if any of our receivables represent a limited number of customers or are concentrated in foreign markets if we are unable to collect our accounts receivable as they become due it could adversely affect our liquidity and working capital position 

generally we have been able to collect our accounts receivable in the ordinary course of business we do not hold any collateral to secure payment from customers we have trade credit insurance on the majority of our customers to mitigate accounts receivable risk 

a majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to major retailers including digital storefronts and platform partners and distributors our five largest customers accounted for 715 701 and 707 of net revenue during the fiscal years ended march 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively as of march 31 2020 and 2019 five customers accounted for 581 and 666 of our gross accounts receivable respectively customers that individually accounted for more than 10 of our gross accounts receivable balance comprised 488 and 558 of such balances at march 31 2020 and 2019 respectively we had two customers who accounted for 294 and 194 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2020 and two customers who accounted for 401 and 157 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2019 we did not have any additional customers that exceeded 10 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2020 and 2019 based upon performing ongoing credit evaluations maintaining trade credit insurance on a majority of our customers and our past collection experience we believe that the receivable balances from these largest customers do not represent a significant credit risk although we actively monitor each customers credit worthiness and economic conditions that may affect our customers business and access to capital we are monitoring the current global economic conditions including credit markets and other factors as it relates to our customers in order to manage the risk of uncollectible accounts receivable including as a result of covid19 

we believe our current cash shortterm investments and projected cash flow from operations along with availability under our credit agreement will provide us with sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash requirements for working capital capital expenditures and commitments on both a shortterm and longterm basis our liquidity and capital resources were not materially affected by the covid19 pandemic and related volatility and slowdown in the global financial markets during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 for further discussion regarding the potential future impacts of the covid19 pandemic and related economic conditions on our business refer to part ii item 1a risk factors 

as of march 31 2020 the amount of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the us by our foreign subsidiaries was 5735 million these balances are dispersed across various locations around the world we believe that such dispersion meets the business and liquidity needs of our foreign affiliates in addition we expect to have the ability to generate sufficient cash domestically to support ongoing operations for the foreseeable future 

the tax act as enacted in december 2017 includes a number of provisions which generally establish a territorialstyle system for taxing foreign income of domestic multinational corporations our current intention is to reinvest indefinitely earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and therefore we have not recorded any tax liabilities associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings 

our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 142 million shares of our common stock under this program we may purchase shares from time to time through a variety of methods including in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws repurchases are subject to the availability of stock prevailing market conditions the trading price of the stock our financial performance and other conditions the program does not require us to repurchase shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time for any reason during the fiscal years ended march 31 2020 2019 and 2018 we repurchased zero 37 million and 15 million shares of our common stock respectively in the open market for 00 million 3624 million and 1548 million respectively including commissions as 

part of the program as of march 31 2020 we had repurchased a total of 104 million shares of our common stock under the program and 38 million shares of our common stock remained available for repurchase under the share repurchase program 

our changes in cash flows were as follows 



at march 31 2020 we had 19934 million of cash cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents compared to 13920 million at march 31 2019 the increase in cash cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents from march 31 2019 was due primarily to net cash provided by operating activities from sales  partially offset by investments in software development and licenses as well as royalty payments and to a lesser extent net cash from investing activities these net increases were offset by net cash used in financing activities which was primarily related to tax payments related to net share settlements of our restricted stock 

contractual obligations and commitments 

we have entered into various agreements in the ordinary course of business that require substantial cash commitments over the next several years generally these include 

• software development and licensing we make payments to thirdparty software developers that include contractual payments to developers under several software development agreements that expire at various times through march 2025 our aggregate outstanding software development commitments assume satisfactory performance by thirdparty software developers we also have licensing commitments that primarily consist of obligations to holders of intellectual property rights for use of their trademarks copyrights technology or other intellectual property rights in the development of our products 

• marketing we have certain minimum marketing support commitments where we commit to spend specified amounts related to marketing our products marketing commitments expire at various times through september 2025 

• operating leases our offices are occupied under noncancelable operating leases expiring at various times through december 2032 we also lease certain furniture equipment and automobiles under noncancelable leases expiring through june 2023 some of the leases have fixed rent increases and also include inducements to enter into the lease the effect of such amounts are deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the related lease term 

• purchase obligations  these obligations are primarily related to agreements to purchase services that are enforceable and legally binding on us that specifies all significant terms including fixed minimum or variable pricing provisions and the approximate timing of the transactions expiring at various times through march 2024 

a summary of annual minimum contractual obligations and commitments as of march 31 2020 is as follows in thousands of dollars 



• income taxes at march 31 2020 we had recorded a liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties of 307 million for which we are unable to make a reasonable and reliable estimate of the period in which these liabilities will be settled with the respective tax authorities therefore these liabilities have not been included in the contractual obligations table 

• legal and other proceedings we are or may become subject to demands and claims including intellectual property and employment related claims and are involved in routine litigation in the ordinary course of business which we do not believe to be material to our business or financial statements we have appropriately accrued amounts related to certain of these claims and legal and other proceedings while it is reasonably possible that a loss may be incurred in excess of the amounts accrued in our financial statements we believe that such losses unless otherwise disclosed would not be material 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of march 31 2020 and 2019 we did not have any material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial parties such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such we are not exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 

international operations 

net revenue earned outside of the united states is principally generated by our operations in europe asia australia canada and latin america for the fiscal years ended march 31 2020 2019 and 2018 425 465 and 413 respectively of our net revenue was earned outside the united states we are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade including increased credit risks tariffs and duties fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates shipping delays and international political regulatory and economic developments all of which can have a significant effect on our operating results 

fluctuations in quarterly operating results and seasonality 

we have experienced fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results as a result of the timing of the introduction of new titles variations in sales of titles developed for particular platforms market acceptance of our titles development and promotional expenses relating to the introduction of new titles sequels or enhancements of existing titles projected and actual changes in platforms the timing and success of title introductions by our competitors product returns changes in pricing policies by us and our competitors the accuracy of retailers forecasts of consumer demand the size and timing of acquisitions the timing of orders from major customers and order cancellations and delays in product shipment sales of our products are also seasonal with peak demand typically occurring in the fourth calendar quarter during the holiday season for certain of our software products with multiple performance obligations we defer the recognition of our net revenue over an estimated service period which generally ranges from 6 to 15 months as a result the quarter in which we generate the highest net bookings may be different from the quarter in which we recognize the highest amount of net revenue quarterly comparisons of operating results are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential loss arising from fluctuations in market rates and prices our market risk exposures primarily include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates relates primarily to our shortterm investment portfolio and variable rate debt under the credit agreement 

we seek to manage our interest rate risk by maintaining a shortterm investment portfolio that includes corporate bonds with high credit quality and maturities less than two years since shortterm investments mature relatively quickly and can be reinvested at the thencurrent market rates interest income on a portfolio consisting of shortterm securities is more subject to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longerterm maturities however the fair value of a shortterm portfolio is less sensitive to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longerterm securities we do not currently use derivative financial instruments in our shortterm investment portfolio our investments are held for purposes other than trading 

as of march 31 2020 we had 6440 million of shortterm investments which included 4530 million of availableforsale securities the availableforsale securities were recorded at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax in stockholders equity we also had 13577 million of cash and cash equivalents that are comprised primarily of money market funds and banktime deposits we determined that based on the composition of our investment portfolio there was no material interest rate risk exposure to our consolidated financial statements or liquidity as of march 31 2020 

historically fluctuations in interest rates have not had a significant effect on our operating results under our credit agreement loans will bear interest at a rate of a 0250 to 0750 above a certain base rate 550 at march 31 2020 or b 1125 to 1750 above libor approximately 166 at march 31 2020 which rates are determined by reference to our consolidated total net leverage ratio changes in market rates may affect our future interest expense if there is an outstanding balance on our line of credit at march 31 2020 there were no outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we transact business in foreign currencies and are exposed to risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates accounts relating to foreign operations are translated into united states dollars using prevailing exchange rates at the relevant period end translation adjustments are included as a separate component of stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheets for the fiscal years ended march 31 2020 and 2019 our foreign currency translation adjustment was a loss of 274 million and a loss of 288 million respectively we recognized a foreign currency exchange transaction loss of 36 million a loss of 05 million and a loss of 30 million for the fiscal years ended march 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively in interest and other net in our consolidated statements of operations 

balance sheet hedging activities 

we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with nonfunctional currency denominated cash balances and intercompany funding loans nonfunctional currency denominated accounts receivable and nonfunctional currency denominated accounts payable these transactions are not designated as hedging instruments and are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts is reported as either assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value are reported in interest and other net in our consolidated statements of operations we do not enter into derivative financial contracts for speculative or trading purposes at march 31 2020 we had 526 million of forward contracts outstanding to buy foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars and 1220 million of forward contracts outstanding to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars all of which have maturities of less than one year at march 31 2019 we had 1166 million of forward contracts outstanding to buy foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars and 878 million of forward contracts outstanding to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars all of which have maturities of less than one year for the fiscal years ended march 31 2020 2019 and 2018 we recorded a loss of 10 million a gain of 168 million and a loss of 195 million respectively related to foreign currency forward contracts in interest and other net on the consolidated statements of operations as of march 31 2020 and 2019 the fair value of these outstanding forward contracts was a loss of 00 million and a loss 04 million respectively and is included in accrued and other current liabilities the fair value of these outstanding forward contracts is estimated based on the prevailing exchange rates of the various hedged currencies as of the end of the period 

our hedging programs are designed to reduce but do not entirely eliminate the effect of currency exchange rate movements we believe the counterparties to these foreign currency forward contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks and that the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risks there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations which may be more volatile as a result of covid19 for the fiscal year ended march 31 2020 425 of our revenue was generated outside the united states using sensitivity analysis a hypothetical 10 increase in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would decrease revenue by 43 while a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would increase revenue by 43 in the opinion of management a substantial portion of this fluctuation would be offset by cost of goods sold and operating expenses incurred in local currency

we use a product investment review process to evaluate potential titles for investment to review existing titles in development and to assess titles after release to measure their performance in the market and the return on our investment we apply this process to all of our products whether internally or externally developed the product investment review process includes reviews of each project at various stages of development by our executive management team and the senior management of our publishing labels and includes coordination between our sales and marketing personnel before the launch of titles this disciplined approach to product investment is expected to enhance the competitiveness and profitability of our titles 

we develop our products using a combination of our internal development teams and external development resources acting under contract with us we typically select external developers based on their track record and expertise in developing products in the same category or genre one developer will generally produce the same game for multiple platforms and will also produce sequels to the original game we believe that selecting and using development resources in this manner allows us to leverage the particular expertise of our internal and external development resources which we believe increases the quality of our products

we are dependent on a limited number of customers that account for a significant portion of our sales sales to our five largest customers during the fiscal year ended march 31 2019  accounted for 701  of our net revenue with sony microsoft and gamestop each accounting for more than 100 of our net revenue during the fiscal year ended march 31 2019  

we also distribute our titles addon content and ingame purchases through direct digital download via the internet to consoles and pcs including smartphones and tablets we view digital distribution as an important growth opportunity for our industry and company however we expect that packaged goods and traditional retailers will continue to be a significant channel for the sale of our products for the foreseeable future

we market titles by 



guidelines of the entertainment software rating board or the esrb an independent selfregulatory body that assigns ratings and enforces advertising guidelines for the interactive software industry 

 as of march 31 2019  we had a sales and marketing staff of 510  people 

product procurement 

we procure products from suppliers principally using standard purchase orders based on our assessment of market demand we carry inventory quantities that we believe are necessary to provide rapid response to retailer orders we utilize electronic data interchange with many of our customers to enhance the efficiency of placing and shipping orders and receiving payments 

competition 

in our business we compete with 

 competition in the entertainment software industry is based on innovation features playability product quality brand name recognition compatibility with popular platforms access to distribution channels price marketing and customer service our business is driven by hit titles which require increasing budgets for development and marketing competition for our titles is influenced by the timing of competitive product releases and the similarity of such products to our titles and may result in loss of shelf space or a reduction in sellthrough of our titles at retail stores 

trends and factors affecting our business 

product release schedule our financial results are affected by the timing of our product releases and the commercial success of those titles our grand theft auto  products in particular have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue sales of our grand theft auto  products generated 257  of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2019  in october 2018 we released red dead redemption 2  sales of red dead redemption  products generated 321  of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2019  the timing of our grand theft auto  or red dead redemption  product releases may affect our financial performance on a quarterly and annual basis 

economic environment and retailer performance we continue to monitor economic conditions that may unfavorably affect our businesses such as deteriorating consumer demand pricing pressure on our products credit quality of our receivables and foreign currency exchange rates our business is dependent upon a limited number of customers who account for a significant portion of our revenue our five largest customers accounted for 701  707  and 655  of net revenue during the fiscal years 

ended march 31 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively as of march 31 2019  and 2018  five customers comprised 666  and 654  of our gross accounts receivable respectively with our significant customers those that individually comprised more than 10 of our gross accounts receivable balance accounting for 558  and 532  of such balance at march 31 2019  and 2018  respectively we had two customers who accounted for 401  and 157  of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2019  and two customers who accounted for 377  and 155  of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2018  we did not have any additional customers that exceeded 10 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2019  and 2018  the economic environment has affected our customers in the past and may do so in the future bankruptcies or consolidations of our large retail customers could seriously hurt our business due to uncollectible accounts receivables and the concentration of purchasing power among the remaining large retailers certain of our large customers sell used copies of our games which may negatively affect our business by reducing demand for new copies of our games while the downloadable content that we now offer for certain of our titles may serve to reduce used game sales we expect used game sales to continue to adversely affect our business 

hardware platforms we derive most of our revenue from the sale of products made for video game consoles manufactured by third parties such as sonys ps4 and microsofts xbox one which comprised 837  of our net revenue by product platform for the fiscal year ended march 31 2019  the success of our business is dependent upon the consumer acceptance of these platforms and the continued growth in the installed base of these platforms when new hardware platforms are introduced demand for software based on older platforms typically declines which may negatively affect our business during the market transition to the new consoles we continually monitor console hardware sales we manage our product delivery on each current and future platform in a manner we believe to be most effective to maximize our revenue opportunities and achieve the desired return on our investments in product development accordingly our strategy is to focus our development efforts on a select number of the highest quality titles for these platforms while also expanding our offerings for emerging platforms such as tablets smartphones and online games 

online content and digital distribution the interactive entertainment software industry is delivering a growing amount of content through digital online delivery methods we provide a variety of online delivered products and offerings virtually all of our titles that are available through retailers as packaged goods products are also available through direct digital download from websites we own and others owned by third parties in addition we aim to drive ongoing engagement and incremental revenue from recurrent consumer spending on our titles through virtual currency addon content and ingame purchases we also publish an expanding variety of titles for tablets and smartphones which are delivered to consumers through digital download note 2 to the consolidated financial statements revenue from contracts with customers discloses that net revenue from digital online channels comprised 630  of our net revenue by distribution channel for the fiscal year ended march 31 2019  we expect online delivery of games and game offerings to become an increasing part of our business over the longterm 

international operations 

international sales are a significant part of our business for the fiscal years ended march 31 2019  2018  and 2017  465  413  and 439  respectively of our net revenue was earned outside the united states we are continuing to execute on our growth initiatives in asia where our strategy is to broaden the distribution of our existing products and expand our online gaming presence especially in china and south korea we are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade including increased credit risks tariffs and duties fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates shipping delays and international political regulatory and economic developments all of which can have a significant effect on our operating results see notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements 

segment and geographic information 

see notes 1 2 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

employees 

as of march 31 2019  we had 4894  fulltime employees of which 2597  were employed outside of the united states none of our regular employees is subject to collective bargaining agreements we consider our relations with employees to be satisfactory 




 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties which may affect our future financial performance because of the risks and uncertainties described below as well as other factors affecting our operating results and financial condition past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and our business and financial performance could be harmed and the market value of our securities could decline 

risks relating to our business 

we are dependent on the future success of our grand theft auto products and we must continue to publish hit titles or sequels to such hit titles in order to compete successfully in our industry 

grand theft auto  and certain of our other titles such as red dead redemption  or nba 2k  are hit products and have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue grand theft auto  products contributed 257  of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2019  and the five bestselling franchises including grand theft auto  which may change year over year in the aggregate accounted for 918  of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2019  if we fail to continue to develop and sell new commercially successful hit titles or sequels to such hit titles or experience any delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of our hit titles or their sequels our revenue and profits may decrease substantially and we may incur losses in addition competition in our industry is intense and a relatively small number of hit titles account for a large portion of total revenue in our industry hit products offered by our competitors may take a larger share of consumer spending than we anticipate which could cause revenue generated from our products to fall below our expectations if our competitors develop more successful products or services at lower price points or based on payment models perceived as offering better value or if we do not continue to develop consistently high quality and wellreceived products and services our revenue and profitability may decline in addition both the online and mobile games marketplaces are characterized by frequent product introductions relatively low barriers to entry and new and evolving business methods technologies and platforms for development widespread consumer adoption of these new platforms for games and other technological advances in andor new business or payment models in online or mobile game offerings could negatively affect our sales of console and traditional pc products before we have an opportunity to develop profitable businesses in such markets 

we are subject to product development risks which could result in delays and additional costs and we must adapt to changes in software technologies 

we depend on our internal development studios and thirdparty software developers to develop new interactive entertainment software within anticipated release schedules and cost projections the development cycle for new titles generally ranges from 12 months for annual sports releases to multiple years for certain of our topselling titles therefore our development costs can be substantial if we or our third party developers experience unanticipated development delays financial difficulties or additional costs we may not be able to release titles according to our schedule and at budgeted costs there can be no assurance that our products will be sufficiently successful so that we can recoup these costs or make a profit on these products 

additionally in order to stay competitive our internal development studios must anticipate and adapt to rapid technological changes affecting software development any inability to respond to technological advances and implement new technologies could render our products obsolete or less marketable further the failure to pursue the development of new technology platforms or business models that obtain meaningful commercial success in a timely manner may negatively affect our business resulting in increased production costs and more strenuous competition   

the inability of our products to achieve significant market acceptance delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of our products may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

new products may not achieve significant market acceptance generate sufficient sales or be introduced in a timely manner to permit us to recover development manufacturing and marketing costs associated with these products the life cycle of a title generally involves a relatively high level of sales during the first few months after introduction followed by a rapid decline in sales because sales associated with an initial product launch generally constitute a high percentage of the total sales associated with the life of a product delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of one or more new products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results and cause our operating results to be materially different from our expectations 

our business is subject to our ability to develop commercially successful products for the current video game platforms 

we derive most of our revenue from the sale of products made for video game platforms manufactured by third parties such as sonys ps4 and microsofts xbox one which comprised 837  of our net revenue by product platform for the fiscal year ended march 31 2019  the success of our business is subject to the continued popularity of these platforms and our ability to develop commercially successful products for these platforms 

we may experience declines or fluctuations in the recurring portion of our business 

our business model includes revenue that we deem recurring in nature such as revenue from our annualized titles and associated services and ongoing mobile businesses while we have been able to forecast the revenue from these areas of our business with greater certainty than for new offerings we cannot provide assurances that consumers will purchase these games and services on a consistent basis furthermore we may cease to offer games and services that we previously had deemed to be recurring in nature consumer purchases of our games and services may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including their level of satisfaction with our games and services our ability to improve and innovate our annualized titles our ability to adapt our games and services to new platforms outages and disruptions of online services the games and services offered by our competitors our marketing and advertising efforts or declines in consumer activity generally as a result of economic downturns among others any decline or fluctuation in the recurring portion of our business may have a negative impact on our financial and operating results 

connectivity issues could affect our ability to sell and provide online services for our products and could affect our profitability 

we rely upon thirdparty digital delivery platforms such as microsofts xbox live playstation network steam and other thirdparty service providers to provide connectivity from the consumer to our digital products and our online services connectivity issues could prevent customers from accessing this content and our ability to successfully market and sell our products could be adversely affected in addition we could experience similar issues related to services we host on our internal servers such issues also could affect our ability to provide online services and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

our business could be adversely affected if our consumer data protection measures are not seen as adequate or there are breaches of our security measures or unintended disclosures of our consumer data 

we are collecting and storing consumer information including personal information we take measures to protect our consumer data from unauthorized access or disclosure it is possible that our security controls over consumer data may not prevent the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information in addition due to the high profile nature of our products we may draw a disproportionately higher amount of attention and attempts to breach our security controls than companies with lower profile products a security breach that leads to disclosure of consumer account information including personally identifiable information could harm our reputation compel us to comply with disparate breach notification laws in various jurisdictions and otherwise subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue a resulting perception that our products or services do not adequately protect the privacy of personal information could result in a loss of current or potential consumers and business partners in addition if any of our business partners experience a security breach that leads to disclosure of consumer account information our reputation could be harmed resulting in loss of revenue 

in addition certain of our products are online enabled the ability of our products to offer online functionality and our ability to offer content through a video game platforms digital distribution channel is dependent upon the continued operation and security of such platforms online network these third party networks as well as our own internal systems and websites and the security measures related thereto may be breached as a result of thirdparty action including intentional misconduct by computer hackers employee error malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers data or our data including our intellectual property and other confidential business information or our information technology systems because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs we may lose business suffer irreparable damage to our reputation andor incur significant costs and expenses relating to the investigation and possible litigation of claims relating to such event 

the laws and regulations concerning data privacy and certain other aspects of our business are continually evolving failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business 

we are subject to certain privacy and data protection laws including those in the united states us certain activities related to processing the personal data of european union eu individuals are conducted by our united kingdom ukbased data controller or our local entities in the eu the us childrens online privacy protection act also regulates the collection use and disclosure of personal information from children under 13 years of age failure to comply with privacy laws data protection 

laws or age restrictions may increase our costs subject us to expensive and distracting government investigations and result in substantial fines 

privacy and data protection laws are rapidly changing and likely will continue to do so for the foreseeable future which could have an impact on our approach to operating and marketing our games for example the eu general data protection regulation gdpr became effective on may 25 2018 replacing data protection directive 9546ec gdpr applies to us because we receive and process the personal data of individuals in the eu and we maintain certain local entities in the eu responsible for processing personal data gdpr contains significant penalties for noncompliance countries in the eu are still enacting national laws that correspond to certain portions of the gdpr in the us the state of california enacted the california consumer privacy act ccpa on june 28 2018 the ccpa will become effective on january 1 2020 and will apply to processing of personal data of california residents however several proposed amendments to the ccpa are still being considered by the california legislature the us government including the federal trade commission and the department of commerce also continue to review the need for greater or different regulation over the collection of personal information and information about consumer behavior on the internet and on mobile devices various government and consumer agencies worldwide have also called for new regulation and changes in industry practices 

player use of our games is subject to our privacy policy end user license agreements eula and terms of service if we fail to comply with our posted privacy policy eula or terms of service or if we fail to comply with existing privacyrelated or data protection laws and regulations it could result in proceedings or litigation against us by governmental authorities or others which could result in fines or judgments against us damage our reputation affect our financial condition and harm our business if regulators the media or consumers raise any concerns about our privacy and data protection or consumer protection practices even if unfounded this could also result in fines or judgments against us damage our reputation negatively affect our financial condition and damage our business 

it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted or construed to apply to us in the us and elsewhere that could restrict the interactive entertainment industry including player privacy advertising taxation content suitability copyright distribution and antitrust furthermore the growth and development of electronic commerce and virtual goods may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on companies such as ours conducting business through digital sales any such changes would require us to devote legal and other resources to address such regulation for example existing laws or new laws regarding the regulation of currency banking institutions and unclaimed property may be interpreted to cover virtual currency or virtual goods if that were to occur we may be required to seek licenses authorizations or approvals from relevant regulators the granting of which may be dependent on us meeting certain capital and other requirements and we may be subject to additional regulation and oversight all of which could significantly increase our operating costs changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the us or elsewhere regarding these activities may lessen the growth of the interactive entertainment industry and impair our business financial condition and operating results 

although we have structured and operate our skill tournaments with applicable laws in mind including any applicable laws relating to gambling and believe that playing these games does not constitute gambling our skill tournaments could in the future become subject to gamblingrelated rules and regulations and expose us to civil and criminal penalties we also sometimes offer consumers of our online and casual games various types of contests and promotional opportunities we are subject to laws in a number of jurisdictions concerning the operation and offering of such activities and games many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business further some of our online games and other services include random digital item mechanics which may become subject to regulations in various jurisdictions if these were to occur we might be required to seek licenses authorizations or approvals from relevant regulators the granting of which may be dependent on us meeting certain capital and other requirements and we may be subject to additional regulation and oversight such as reporting to regulators all of which could significantly increase our operating costs changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the us europe or elsewhere regarding these activities may lessen the growth of casual game services and impair our business also existing laws or new laws regarding the marketing of ingame or inapp purchases regulation of currency banking institutions unclaimed property or money laundering may be interpreted to cover virtual currency or goods 

security breaches involving the source code for our products or other sensitive and proprietary information could adversely affect our business 

we securely store the source code for our interactive entertainment software products as it is created a breach whether physical electronic or otherwise of the systems on which such source code and other sensitive data are stored could lead to damage or piracy of our software in addition certain parties with whom we do business are given access to our sensitive and proprietary information in order to provide services and support our team these third parties may misappropriate our information and engage in unauthorized use of it if we are subject to data security breaches we may have a loss in sales or increased costs arising from the restoration or implementation of additional security measures which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results any theft andor unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an event could adversely affect our competitive position reputation brand and future sales of our 

products our business could be subject to significant disruption and we could suffer monetary and other losses and reputational harm in the event of such incidents and claims 

we rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business any significant system or network disruption could have a negative impact on our business 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks some of which are within taketwo and some of which are managed andor hosted by thirdparty providers all information technology systems and networks are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources including but not limited to cyberattacks computer viruses malicious software security breach energy blackouts natural disasters terrorism war and telecommunication failures we may also face sophisticated attacks referred to as advanced persistent threats which are cyberattacks aimed at compromising our intellectual property and other commerciallysensitive information such as the source code and game assets for our software or confidential customer or employee information which remain undetected for prolonged periods of time information technology system or network failure or security breach could negatively affect our business continuity operations and financial results these risks extend to the networks and ecommerce sites of console platform providers and other partners who sell and host our content online along with our partners we have expended and expect to continue to expend financial and operational resources to implement certain systems processes and technologies to guard against cyber risks and to help protect our data and systems however the techniques used to exploit disable damage disrupt or gain access to our networks our products and services supporting technological infrastructure intellectual property and other assets change frequently continue to evolve in sophistication and volume and often are not detected for long periods of time our systems processes and technologies and the systems processes and technologies of our business partners or our thirdparty service providers may not be adequate against all eventualities in addition the costs to respond to mitigate andor notify affected parties of cyberattacks and other security vulnerabilities are significant any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or cyber risks or detect or respond adequately to a security breach or cyber risk could result in a loss of anticipated revenue interruptions to our products and services cause us to incur significant remediation and notification costs degrade the user experience cause consumers to lose confidence in our products and services and significant legal and financial costs 

successful exploitation of our systems can have other negative effects upon the products services and user experience we offer in particular the virtual economies that we have established in many of our games are subject to abuse exploitation and other forms of fraudulent activity that can negatively affect our business virtual economies involve the use of virtual currency andor virtual assets that can be used or redeemed by a player within a particular game or service the abuse or exploitation of our virtual economies include the illegitimate generation and sale of virtual items in black markets these kinds of activities and the steps that we take to address these issues may result in a loss of anticipated revenue interfere with players’ enjoyment of a balanced game environment and cause reputational harm 

our efforts to expand into new products and services may subject us to additional risks 

in recent years we have invested in emerging opportunities in interactive entertainment played on mobile platforms including tablets and smartphones and online platforms including social networks we have also grown our product offerings that are available through digital download including virtual currency through our existing franchises such as grant theft auto  and nba 2k  as well as through product offerings by social point and other mobile product offerings we are actively investing to capitalize on these trends in order to diversify our product mix reduce our operating risks and increase our revenue there are risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed there is no assurance that we will be able to attract a sufficiently large number of customers or recover costs incurred for developing and marketing any of these new products or services for example we may offer games that do not attract sufficient purchases of virtual currency which may cause our investments into this product space such as through our acquisition of social point to fail to realize the expected benefits external factors such as competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also have an impact on the successful implementation of any new products or services failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we depend on our key management and product development personnel 

our continued success will depend to a significant extent on our senior management team and our relationship with zelnickmedia corporation zelnickmedia our executive chairmanchief executive officer and president are partners of zelnickmedia we are also highly dependent on the expertise skills and knowledge of certain of our rockstar employees and other key creative personnel responsible for content creation and development of our grand theft auto  titles and titles based on other brands we may not be able to continue to retain these personnel at current compensation levels or at all 

the loss of the services of our executive officers zelnickmedia our key rockstar employees or other key creative personnel could significantly harm our business in addition if one or more key employees were to join a competitor or form a competing 

company we may lose additional personnel experience material interruptions in product development delays in bringing products to market and difficulties in our relationships with licensors suppliers and customers which would significantly harm our business failure to continue to attract and retain other qualified management and creative personnel could adversely affect our business and prospects 

declines in consumer spending and other adverse changes in the economy could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

most of our products involve discretionary spending on the part of consumers we believe that consumer spending is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income this makes our products particularly sensitive to general economic conditions and economic cycles as consumers are generally more willing to make discretionary purchases including purchases of products like ours during periods in which favorable economic conditions prevail adverse economic conditions such as a prolonged us or international general economic downturn including periods of increased inflation unemployment levels tax rates interest rates energy prices or declining consumer confidence could also reduce consumer spending reduced consumer spending has and may in the future continue to result in reduced demand for our products and may also require increased selling and promotional expenses which has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results in addition during periods of relative economic weakness our consolidated credit risk reflecting our counterparty dealings with distributors customers capital providers and others may increase perhaps materially so furthermore uncertainty and adverse changes in the economy could also increase the risk of material losses on our investments increase costs associated with developing and publishing our products increase the cost and availability of sources of financing and increase our exposure to material losses from bad debts any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results if economic conditions worsen our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 

changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act herein referred to as the act” the act made broad and complex changes to the us tax code that could materially affect us the act reduced the us federal corporate income tax rate from 35  to 21  effective january 1 2018 and required companies to pay a onetime transition tax on the previously untaxed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries in addition the act made other changes that may affect us including but not limited to 1 a base erosion antiabuse tax beat which is a new minimum tax 2 generally eliminating us federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries 3 a new provision that taxes global intangible lowtaxed income gilti 4 the repeal of the domestic production activity deduction and 5 other base broadening provisions 

we have completed accounting for the income tax effects of the act see note 15  income tax to our consolidated financial statements for further information we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the act on us it is possible that these changes could have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate tax payments financial condition or results of operations the new tax law is complex and additional interpretive guidance may be issued that could affect the interpretations and assumptions we have made as well as actions we may take as a result of the act 

we are a multinational corporation with operations in the us and various other jurisdictions around the world accordingly we are subject to tax in the us and in various other jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are required to estimate future taxes although we currently believe our tax estimates are reasonable the estimation process is inherently uncertain and such estimates are not binding on tax authorities further our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by a variety of factors including changes in the business the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in tax elections and changes in applicable tax laws additionally tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities and developments in those audits could adversely affect our income tax provision should the ultimate tax liability exceed estimates our income tax provision and net income or loss could be materially affected 

in addition numerous countries are evaluating their existing tax laws due in part to recommendations made by the organization for economic cooperation and development’s “oecd’s” base erosion and profit shifting “beps” project although we cannot predict whether or in what form any legislation based on such proposals may be adopted by the countries in which we do business future tax reform based on such proposals may increase the amount of taxes we pay and adversely affect our operating results and cash flows 

historically we recorded a valuation allowance against most of our us deferred tax assets in the current fiscal year we released our valuation allowance on certain us deferred tax assets as a result of a determination that it was morelikelythannot that such deferred tax assets would be realized our determination took into account the successful launch of red dead redemption 2  during 

the year along with our recent positive trend of earnings we will continue to evaluate our ability to realize our us deferred tax assets if future evidence suggests that any changes are required to reflect the amount of our us deferred tax asset that is morelikelythannot to be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance as needed in the appropriate period 

on june 21 2018 the us supreme court issued its decision in south dakota v wayfair which overturned previous case law that precluded states from requiring retailers to collect and remit sales tax on sales made to instate customers unless the retailer had a physical presence in the state although this case is limited to sales tax collection obligations we continue to monitor the potential impact of this decision on our state income tax footprint 

the ultimate amount of tax payable in a given financial statement period may be materially affected by sudden or unforeseen changes in tax laws changes in the mix and level of earnings by taxing jurisdictions or changes to existing accounting rules or regulations for example on july 24 2018 the ninth circuit court of appeals issued an opinion in altera corp v commissioner requiring related parties in an intercompany costsharing arrangement to share expenses related to stock compensation on august 7 2018 the opinion was withdrawn to allow time for a reconstituted panel to confer we will continue to monitor ongoing developments and the final opinion could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

we earn a significant amount of our operating income and continue to hold a significant portion of our cash outside the us our current intention is to reinvest indefinitely earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and therefore we have not recorded any tax liabilities associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings 

we are also required to pay taxes other than income taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the us and foreign jurisdictions we are regularly under examination by tax authorities with respect to these nonincome taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations changes in our business or changes in applicable tax law or interpretations will not have an adverse effect on our net income or loss and financial condition 

our quarterly operating results are dependent on the release of hit titles and are highly seasonal which may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate significantly 

we have experienced and may continue to experience wide fluctuations in quarterly operating results the release of a hit title typically leads to a high level of sales during the first few months after introduction followed by a rapid decline in sales in addition the interactive entertainment industry is highly seasonal with sales typically higher during the fourth calendar quarter due primarily to increased demand for games during the holiday season demand for and sales of titles in our nba 2k  series are also seasonal in that they are typically released just prior to the start of the nba season if a key event or sports season to which our product release schedule is tied were to be delayed or canceled our sales might also suffer disproportionately our failure or inability to produce hit titles or introduce products on a timely basis to meet seasonal fluctuations in demand could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results the uncertainties associated with software development manufacturing lead times production delays and the approval process for products by hardware manufacturers and other licensors make it difficult to predict the quarter in which our products will ship and therefore may cause us to fail to meet financial expectations 

price protection granted to our customers and returns of our published titles by our customers may adversely affect our operating results 

we are exposed to the risk of price protection and product returns with respect to our customers our distribution arrangements with customers generally do not give them the right to return titles to us or to cancel firm orders however we sometimes accept product returns from our distribution customers for stock balancing and negotiate accommodations for customers which include credits and returns when demand for specific products falls below expectations we grant price protection and accept returns in connection with our publishing arrangements and revenue is recognized after deducting estimated price protection and reserves for returns while we believe that we can reliably estimate future price protection and returns if price protection and return rates for our products exceed our reserves our revenue could decline which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

increased sales of used video game products could lower our sales 

certain of our larger customers sell used video games which are generally priced lower than new video games if our customers increase their sales of used video games it could negatively affect our sales of new video games and have an adverse influence on our business financial condition and operating results 

a limited number of customers account for a significant portion of our sales the loss of a principal customer or other significant business relationship could seriously hurt our business 

a substantial portion of our product sales are made to a limited number of customers sales to our five largest customers during the fiscal year ended march 31 2019  accounted for 701  of our net revenue with sony microsoft and gamestop each accounting for more than 100 of our net revenue during the fiscal year ended march 31 2019  our sales are made primarily pursuant to 

purchase orders without longterm agreements or other commitments and our customers may terminate their relationship with us at any time certain of our customers may decline to carry products containing mature content the loss of our relationships with principal customers or a decline in sales to principal customers including as a result of a product being rated ao age 18 and over could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results in addition if our customers are subject to pricing pressures due to deteriorating demand for our products competitive pressure or otherwise such customers may pass those pricing pressures through to us which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

furthermore our customers may also be placed into bankruptcy become insolvent or be liquidated due to economic downturns global contractions of credit or for other factors bankruptcies or consolidations of certain large retail customers could seriously hurt our business including as a result of uncollectible accounts receivable from such customers and the concentration of purchasing power among remaining large retailers in addition our results of operations may be adversely affected if certain of our customers who purchase on credit terms are no longer eligible to purchase on such terms due to their financial distress which may reduce the quantity of products they demand from us 

if our marketing and advertising efforts fail to resonate with consumers our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 

our products are marketed worldwide through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs such as television and online advertising social media advertising print advertising retail merchandising website development and event sponsorship our ability to sell our products and services is dependent in part on the success of these programs if the marketing for our products and services fails to resonate with consumers particularly during the holiday season or other key selling periods or if advertising rates or other media placement costs increase these factors could have a material adverse influence on our business financial condition and operating results 

the interactive entertainment software industry is highly competitive 

we compete for both licenses to properties and the sale of interactive entertainment software with sony and microsoft each of which is a large developer and marketer of software for its own platforms we also compete with game publishers such as activision blizzard inc and electronic arts inc and ubisoft entertainment sa as our business is dependent upon our ability to develop hit titles which require increasing budgets for development and marketing the availability of significant financial resources has become a major competitive factor in developing and marketing software games some of our competitors have greater financial technical personnel and other resources than we do and are able to finance larger budgets for development and marketing and make higher offers to licensors and developers for commercially desirable properties our titles also compete with other forms of entertainment such as social media and casual games in addition to motion pictures television and audio and video products featuring similar themes online computer programs and other entertainment which may be less expensive or provide other advantages to consumers 

a number of software publishers who compete with us have developed and commercialized or are currently developing online games for use by consumers over the internet if technological advances significantly increase the availability of online games and if consumer acceptance of online gaming grows substantially it could result in a decline in our platformbased software sales and negatively affect sales of such products 

increased competition for limited shelf space and promotional support from retailers could affect the success of our business and require us to incur greater expenses to market our titles 

while digital sales are increasingly important to our business for physical sales retailers have limited shelf space and promotional resources and competition is intense among newly introduced interactive entertainment software titles for adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support competition for retail shelf space is expected to continue to increase which may require us to increase our marketing expenditures to maintain desirable sales levels of our titles competitors with more extensive lines and more popular titles may have greater bargaining power with retailers accordingly we may not be able or we may have to pay more than our competitors to achieve similar levels of promotional support and shelf space 

the increasing importance of digital sales to our business exposes us to the risks of that business model including greater competition 

the proportion of our revenues derived from digital content delivery as compared to traditional retail sales may continue to increase the increased importance of digital content delivery in our industry increases our potential competition as the minimum capital needed to produce and publish a digitally delivered game is significantly less than that needed to produce and publish one that is purchased through retail distribution and is played on a game console this will also require us to dedicate capital to developing and implementing alternative marketing strategies which we may not do successfully if either occurs we may be unable to effectively market and distribute our products which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition 

and operating results in addition a continuing shift to digital delivery could result in a deprioritization of our products by traditional retailers the increasing importance of digital sales to our business could also result in increasing issues with our digital distribution process including difficulties our distributors have with collecting from consumers and any associated rebates we would owe 

our business is partly dependent on our ability to enter into successful software development arrangements with third parties 

our success depends on our ability to continually identify and develop new titles on a timely basis we rely on thirdparty software developers for the development of some of our titles quality thirdparty developers are continually in high demand software developers who have developed titles for us in the past may not be available to develop software for us in the future due to the limited number of thirdparty software developers and the limited control that we exercise over them these developers may not be able to complete titles for us on a timely basis or within acceptable quality standards if at all we have entered into agreements with third parties to acquire the rights to publish and distribute interactive entertainment software as well as to use licensed intellectual properties in our titles these agreements typically require us to make development payments pay royalties and satisfy other conditions our development payments may not be sufficient to permit developers to develop new software successfully which could result in material delays and significantly increase our costs to bring particular products to market software development costs promotion and marketing expenses and royalties payable to software developers and thirdparty licensors have increased significantly in recent years and reduce potential profits derived from sales of our software future sales of our titles may not be sufficient to recover development payments and advances to software developers and licensors and we may not have adequate financial and other resources to satisfy our contractual commitments to such developers if we fail to satisfy our obligations under agreements with thirdparty developers and licensors the agreements may be terminated or modified in ways that are burdensome to us and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we cannot publish our titles without the approval of hardware licensors that are also our competitors 

we are required to obtain licenses from certain of our competitors including sony and microsoft to develop and publish titles for their respective hardware platforms our existing platform licenses require that we obtain approval for the publication of new titles on a titlebytitle basis as a result the number of titles we are able to publish for these hardware platforms our ability to manage the timing of the release of these titles and accordingly our net revenue from titles for these hardware platforms may be limited if a licensor chooses not to renew or extend our license agreement at the end of its current term or if a licensor were to terminate our license for any reason or does not approve one or more of our titles we may be unable to publish that title as well as additional titles for that licensors platform termination of any such agreements or disapproval of titles could seriously hurt our business and prospects we may be unable to continue to enter into license agreements for certain current generation platforms on satisfactory terms or at all failure to enter into any such agreement could also seriously hurt our business 

we rely on a limited number of channel partners some of whom influence the fee structures for online distribution of our games on their platforms 

we rely on a limited number of channel partners some of whom have retained the right to change the fee structures for online distribution of both paid content and free content including patches and corrections that we license to them for distribution on their platforms such channel partners ability to set or influence royalty rates may increase costs which could negatively affect our operating margins we may be unable to distribute our content in a costeffective or profitable manner through such distribution channel which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

outside of fee arrangements our agreements with our channel partners sometimes give them significant control over other aspects of the distribution of our products and services that we develop for their platform if our channel partners establish terms that restrict our offerings through their channels or significantly affect the financial terms on which these products or services are offered to our customers we may be unable to distribute our product offerings through them or be forced to do so on a materially worse financial or business terms 

we may not be able to adequately adjust our cost structure in a timely fashion in response to a sudden decrease in demand 

in the event of a significant decline in revenue we may not be able to dispose of facilities reduce personnel or make other changes to our cost structure without disruption to our operations or without significant termination and exit costs management may not be able to implement such actions in a timely manner if at all to offset an immediate shortfall in revenue and profit moreover reducing costs may impair our ability to produce and develop software titles at sufficient levels in the future 

we use open source software in connection with certain of our games and services which may pose particular risks to our proprietary software products and services in a manner that could have a negative impact on our business 

we use open source software in connection with certain of our games and the services we offer some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software or make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost the terms of 

various open source licenses have not been interpreted by courts and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our use of the open source software were it determined that our use was not in compliance with a particular license we may be required to release our proprietary source code pay damages for breach of contract reengineer our games discontinue distribution in the event reengineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our game development efforts any of which could harm our business 

we depend on servers and internet bandwidth to operate our games and digital services with online features if we were to lose server capacity or lack sufficient internet bandwidth for any reason our business could suffer 

we rely on data servers including those owned or controlled by third parties to enable our customers to download our games and other downloadable content and to operate our online games and other products with online functionality events such as limited hardware failure any broadbased catastrophic server malfunction a significant intrusion by hackers that circumvents security measures or a failure of disaster recovery services would likely interrupt the functionality of our games with online services and could result in a loss of sales for games and related services an extended interruption of service could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we expect a significant portion of our games to be online enabled in the future and therefore we must project our future server needs and make advance purchases of servers or server capacity to accommodate expected business demands if we underestimate the amount of server capacity our business requires or if our business were to grow more quickly than expected our consumers may experience service problems such as slow or interrupted gaming access insufficient server capacity may result in decreased sales a loss of our consumer base and adverse consequences to our reputation conversely if we overestimate the amount of server capacity required by our business we may incur additional operating costs 

because of the potential importance of our online business to our revenues and results of operations our ability to access adequate internet bandwidth and online computational resources to support our business is critical if the price of either such resource increases we may not be able to increase our prices or subscriber levels to compensate for such costs which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we submit our products for rating by the entertainment software rating board esrb in the united states and other voluntary or government ratings organizations in foreign countries failure to obtain a target rating for certain of our products could negatively affect our ability to distribute and sell those games as could the rerating of a game for any reason 

we voluntarily submit our game products to the esrb a usbased nonprofit and independent ratings organization the esrb system provides consumers with information about game content using a rating symbol that generally suggests the appropriate player age group and specific content descriptors such as graphic violence profanity or sexually explicit material the esrb may impose significant penalties on game publishers for violations of its rules related to rating or marketing games including revocation of a rating or monetary fines other countries require voluntary or government backed ratings as prerequisites for product sales in some instances we may have to modify our products in order to market them under the target rating which could delay or disrupt the release of our products in addition some of our titles may not be sold at all or without extensive edits in certain countries such as germany 

in the us if the esrb rates a game as ao age 18 and older platform licensors may not certify the game and retailers may refuse to sell it in addition some consumers have reacted to reratings or controversial game content by refusing to purchase such games demanding refunds for games that they had already purchased and refraining from buying other games published by us many of our rockstar titles and certain of our 2k titles have been rated m age 17 and older by the esrb if we are unable to obtain m ratings and instead receive ao ratings on future versions of those or similar titles as a result of changes in the esrbs ratings standards or for other reasons including the adoption of legislation in this area our business and prospects could be negatively affected if any of our games are rerated by the esrb or other foreign based ratings organizations we could be exposed to litigation administrative fines and penalties and other potential liabilities and our operating results and financial condition could be significantly affected 

we have implemented processes to comply with the requirements of the esrb and other ratings organizations and properly display the designated rating symbols and content descriptions nonetheless these processes are subject to human error circumvention overriding and reasonable resource constraints if a video game we published were found to contain undisclosed pertinent content the esrb could rerate a game retailers could refuse to sell it and demand that we accept the return of any unsold copies or returns from customers and consumers could refuse to buy it or demand that we refund their money this could have a material negative affect on our operating results and financial condition in addition we may be exposed to litigation administrative fines and penalties and our reputation could be harmed which could affect sales of other video games we sell if any of these consequences were to occur our business and financial performance could be significantly harmed 

content policies adopted by retailers consumer opposition and litigation could negatively affect sales of our products 

retailers may decline to sell interactive entertainment software containing what they judge to be graphic violence or sexually explicit material or other content that they deem inappropriate for their businesses if retailers decline to sell our products based upon their opinion that they contain objectionable themes graphic violence or sexually explicit material or other generally objectionable content or if any of our previously m rated series products are rated ao we might be required to significantly change or discontinue particular titles or series which in the case of our bestselling grand theft auto  titles could seriously affect our business consumer advocacy groups have opposed sales of interactive entertainment software containing objectionable themes violence or sexual material or other objectionable content by pressing for legislation in these areas and by engaging in public demonstrations and media campaigns additionally although lawsuits seeking damages for injuries allegedly suffered by third parties as a result of video games have generally been unsuccessful in the courts claims of this kind have been asserted against us from time to time and may be asserted and be successful in the future an increase in the number of lawsuits filed by the families of victims of violence may trigger supplemental governmental scrutiny damage our reputation and negatively affect the sale of our products further in 2018 gaming disorder was listed in a version of the world health organizations international classification of diseases and some countries have introduced legislation attempting to address this issue moreover the public dialogue concerning interactive entertainment may have an adverse impact on our reputation and our customers willingness to purchase our products 

our results of operations or reputation may be harmed as a result of offensive consumercreated content 

we are subject to risks associated with the collaborative online features in our games which allow consumers to post narrative comments in real time that are visible to other consumers from time to time objectionable and offensive consumer content may be posted to a gaming or other site with online chat features or game forums which allow consumers to post comments we may be subject to lawsuits governmental regulation or restrictions and consumer backlash including decreased sales and harmed reputation as a result of consumers posting offensive content we may also be subject to consumer backlash from comments made in response to postings we make on social media sites such as facebook youtube and twitter 

we are subject to risks and uncertainties of international trade including fluctuations in the values of local foreign currencies against the dollar 

sales in international markets primarily in europe have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2019  465  of our net revenue was earned outside the us we are continuing to execute on our growth initiatives in asia where our strategy is to broaden the distribution of our existing products and expand our online gaming presence especially in china and south korea we are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade including increased credit risks tariffs and duties fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates shipping delays and international political regulatory and economic developments all of which can have a significant influence on our operating results many of our international sales are made in local currencies which could fluctuate against the dollar while we may use forward exchange contracts to a limited extent to seek to mitigate foreign currency risk our operating results could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations 

we face risks from our international operations 

we are subject to certain risks because of our international operations particularly as we continue to grow our business and presence in asia latin america and other parts of the world changes to and compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations may increase our cost of doing business and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals could harm our international and domestic sales trade legislation in either the us or other countries such as a change in the current tariff structures importexport compliance laws or other trade laws or policies could adversely affect our ability to sell or to distribute in international markets 

the current us administration has voiced concerns about imports from countries potentially engaging in unfair trade practices increased tariffs on certain goods imported into the us from those countries including china and other countries to which we sell products and raised the possibility of imposing significant additional tariff increases the announcement of tariffs and proposed tariffs on imported products by the us has triggered actions from certain foreign governments including china and may trigger additional actions by those and other foreign governments that could have a negative impact on our business further the enforcement of regulations relating to mobile and other games with an online element in china remains uncertain and further changes either in the regulation or their enforcement could have a negative impact on our business in china in order to operate in china all games must have regulatory approval a decision by the chinese government to revoke its approval for any of our games or to decline to approve any products we desire to sell in china in the future could have a negative impact on our business 

we incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our international operations and could become subject to legal penalties in foreign countries if we do not comply with local laws and regulations which may be substantially different from those in the us in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it may be common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by us laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and by local laws such as laws 

prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations including those based in or from countries where practices which violate such laws may be customary will not take actions in violation of our policies any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could have a material adverse effect on our business 

on june 23 2016 the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” on march 29 2017 the uk notified the european council in accordance with article 50 of the treaty on european union of the uk’s intention to withdraw from the eu as a result the british government has been negotiating the terms of the uk’s future relationship with the eu a substantial amount of uncertainty remains regarding the outcome of the ongoing negotiations we continue to assess and monitor the risks our business is likely to face as a result of brexit we are preparing to mitigate those risks with operational and commercial changes to the extent possible and warranted however the legal and regulatory landscape remains uncertain and we have no assurance that such preparations will enable us to avoid a material adverse impact on our business from brexit 

the effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the uk makes to retain access to the eu markets either during a transitional period or more permanently the measures could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and may cause us to lose customers distributors and employees if the uk loses access to the single eu market and the global trade deals negotiated by the eu it could have a detrimental impact on our uk growth such a decline could also make our doing business in europe more difficult which could negatively affect sales to consumers of our products without access to the single eu market it may be more challenging and costly to distribute our products in europe in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace and replicate if there are changes to uk immigration policy as a result of brexit this could affect our employees and their ability to move freely between the eu member states for work related matters 

if we are unable to protect the intellectual property relating to our software the commercial value of our products will be adversely affected and our competitive position could be harmed 

we develop proprietary software and have obtained the rights to publish and distribute software developed by thirdparties we attempt to protect our software and production techniques under patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as through contractual restrictions on disclosure copying and distribution nonetheless our software is susceptible to piracy and unauthorized copying and third parties may potentially exploit or misappropriate our intellectual property and proprietary information causing significant reputational damage unauthorized third parties for example may be able to copy or to reverse engineer our software to obtain and use programming or production techniques that we regard as proprietary well organized piracy operations have also proliferated in recent years resulting in the ability to download pirated copies of our software over the internet although we attempt to incorporate protective measures into our software piracy of our products could negatively affect our future profitability in addition cheating programs or other unauthorized software tools and modifications that enable consumers to cheat in games harm the experience of players who play fairly and could negatively impact the volume of microtransactions or purchases of downloadable content also vulnerabilities in the design of our applications and of the platforms upon which they run could be discovered after their release this may lead to lost revenues from paying consumers or increased cost of developing technological measures to respond to these either of which could negatively affect our business 

if we infringe on or are alleged to infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties our business could be adversely affected 

as our industry grows we may be subject to an increasing amount of litigation that is common in the software industry based on allegations of infringement or other alleged violations of patent copyright andor trademarks in addition we believe that interactive entertainment software will increasingly become the subject of claims that such software infringes on the intellectual property rights of others with both the growth of online functionality and advances in technology game content and software graphics as games become more realistic from time to time we receive notices from third parties or are named in lawsuits by third parties alleging infringement of their proprietary rights although we believe that our software and technologies and the software and technologies of thirdparty developers and publishers with whom we have contractual relations do not and will not infringe or violate proprietary rights of others it is possible that infringement of proprietary rights of others may occur any claims of infringement with or without merit could be time consuming costly and difficult to defend moreover intellectual property litigation or claims could require us to discontinue the distribution of products obtain a license or redesign our products which could result in additional substantial costs and material delays 

our software is susceptible to errors which can harm our financial results and reputation 

the technological advancements of new hardware platforms result in the development of more complex software products as software products become more complex the risk of undetected errors in new products increases we may need to produce and 

distribute patches in order to repair such errors which could be costly and may distract our developers from working on new products if despite testing errors are found in new products or releases after shipments have been made we may have to consider suspending distribution of defective products or offering refunds and we could experience a loss of or delay in timely market acceptance product returns loss of revenue increases in costs relating to the repair of such errors and damage to our reputation 

if we acquire or invest in other businesses intellectual properties or other assets we may be unable to integrate them with our business our financial performance may be impaired andor we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for such transactions 

if appropriate opportunities present themselves we may acquire or make investments in businesses intellectual properties and other assets that we believe are strategic we may not be able to identify negotiate or finance any future acquisition or investment successfully even if we do succeed in acquiring or investing in a business intellectual property or other asset such acquisitions and investments involve a number of risks including 

 future acquisitions and investments could also involve the issuance of our equity and equitylinked securities potentially diluting our existing stockholders the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses writeoffs of goodwill intangibles or acquired inprocess technology or other increased cash and noncash expenses such as stockbased compensation any of the foregoing factors could harm our financial condition or prevent us from achieving improvements in our financial condition and operating performance that could have otherwise been achieved by us on a standalone basis our stockholders may not have the opportunity to review vote on or evaluate future acquisitions or investments 

our ability to acquire and maintain licenses to intellectual property especially for sports titles affects our revenue and profitability competition for these licenses may make them more expensive and increase our costs 

certain of our products are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others for example certain of our 2k products include rights licensed from major sports leagues and players associations similarly some of our other titles are based on licenses of popular entertainment products competition for these licenses is intense if we are unable to maintain and renew these licenses or obtain additional licenses on reasonable economic terms or with significant commercial value our revenue and profitability could decline significantly competition for these licenses may also increase the advances guarantees and royalties that we must 

pay to the licensor which could significantly increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability in addition on certain intellectual property licenses we are subject to guaranteed minimum payments royalties or standards of performance and may not be able to terminate these agreements prior to their stated expiration if such licensed products do not generate revenues in excess of such minimum guarantees our profitability will be adversely affected 

we are subject to contractual covenants which place certain limitations on how we manage our business  

our new credit agreement the new credit agreement may limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt paying dividends repurchasing shares and acquiring or disposing of assets or businesses in addition we have granted a security interest in connection with certain compensatory arrangements which limits our ability to incur senior debt in excess of certain amounts accordingly we may be restricted from taking actions that management believes would be desirable and in the best interests of us and our stockholders our new credit agreement also requires us to satisfy specified financial covenants and comply with other affirmative and negative covenants a breach of any of the covenants contained in our new credit agreement could result in an event of default which would allow our lenders to pursue various remedies including accelerating the repayment of any outstanding indebtedness under our new credit agreement 

our business and products are subject to potential legislation the adoption of such proposed legislation could limit the retail market for our products 

several proposals have been made for federal legislation to regulate our industry such proposals seek to prohibit the sale of products containing certain content included in some of our games if any such proposals are enacted into law it may limit the potential market for some of our games in the us and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results other countries such as germany have adopted laws regulating content both in packaged games and those transmitted over the internet that are stricter than current us laws in the us proposals have also been made by numerous state legislators to regulate and prohibit the sale of interactive entertainment software products containing certain types of violent or sexual content to under 17 or 18 audiences such as the state of californias ultraviolent video games law that sought to ban the sale or rental of violent video games to minors while such legislation to date has been enjoined by industry and retail groups or been found unconstitutional the adoption into law of such legislation in federal andor in state jurisdictions in which we do significant business could severely limit the retail market for some of our games 

change in government regulations relating to the internet could have a negative impact on our business 

we rely on our consumers access to significant levels of internet bandwidth for the sale and digital delivery of our content and the functionality of our games with online features changes in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth popularity or use of the internet including laws affecting net neutrality could decrease the demand for our products and services or increase our cost of doing business although certain jurisdictions have implemented laws and regulations intended to prevent internet service providers from discriminating against particular types of legal traffic on their networks other jurisdictions may lack such laws and regulations or repeal existing laws or regulations for example on december 14 2017 the federal communications commission voted to repeal net neutrality regulations in the us given uncertainty around these rules including changing interpretations amendments or repeal coupled with the potentially significant political and economic power of local internet service providers and the relatively significant level of internet bandwidth access our products and services require we could experience discriminatory or anticompetitive practices that could impede our growth cause us to incur additional expenses or otherwise negatively affect our business 

we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill becomes impaired 

we are required under us generally accepted accounting principles to review our goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating a requirement to reevaluate whether our goodwill continues to be recoverable include a significant decline in stock price and market capitalization slower growth rates in our industry or other materially adverse events we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill is determined this may adversely affect our operating results 

our reported financial results could be adversely affected by the application of existing or future accounting standards to our business as it evolves 

our reported financial results are affected by the accounting policies promulgated by the sec and national accounting standards bodies and the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies for example standards regarding revenue recognition have and could further significantly affect the way we account for revenue related to our products and services we expect that an increasing number of our games will be supported with material postrelease activities such as content updates and onlineenabled features and we could therefore be required to recognize more of the related revenues for those games over 

a period of time rather than at the time of sale further as we increase our downloadable content and add new features to our online services user playing patterns can affect our estimate of the service period may change and we could be required to recognize revenues and defer related costs over a shorter or longer period of time than we initially allocated as we enhance expand and diversify our business and product offerings the application of existing or future financial accounting standards particularly those relating to the way we account for revenue could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results although not necessarily on our cash flows 

we are subject to risks related to corporate and social responsibility and reputation 

many factors influence our reputation including the perception held by our customers business partners and other key stakeholders our business faces increasing scrutiny related to environmental social and governance activities we risk damage to our reputation if we fail to act responsibly in a number of areas such as diversity and inclusion environmental stewardship supply chain management climate change workplace conduct human rights and philanthropy any harm to our reputation could impact employee engagement and retention and the willingness of customers and our partners to do business with us which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows 

risks relating to our common stock 

for purposes of this section risks relating to our common stock references to the company we our and us refer only to taketwo interactive software inc and not to its subsidiaries 

additional issuances or sales of equity securities by us would dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

we may issue equity or equitybased securities in the future in connection with acquisitions or strategic transactions to adjust our ratio of debt to equity including through repayment of outstanding debt to fund expansion of our operations or for other purposes to the extent we issue additional equity securities the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders would be reduced the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect its price the sale or the availability for sale of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause the price of our common stock to decline 

there is no guarantee that we will do additional share repurchases in the future 

the share repurchase program authorized by the board of directors which authorized the repurchase of up to 142 million  shares of our common stock and had 38 million  shares available for repurchase as of the date of this filing does not obligate us to make any purchases at any specific time or situation discontinuing repurchases could adversely affect the price of our common stock the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time for any reason 

our stock price has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly 

the market price of our common stock historically has been and we expect will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us including those discussed in the risk factors in this section as well as others not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material to changes in securities analysts earnings estimates or ratings to our results or future financial guidance falling below our expectations and analysts and investors expectations to factors affecting the computer software entertainment media or electronics industries or to national or international economic conditions 

stock markets in general have experienced over the years and continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected market prices for companies such as ours and that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the affected companies these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock regardless of our operating performance 

delaware law our charter documents and provisions of our debt agreements may impede or discourage a takeover which could cause the market price of our shares to decline 

we are a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders our board of directors has the power without stockholder approval to adopt a stockholder rights plan andor to designate the terms of one or more series of preferred stock and issue shares of preferred stock the ability of our board of directors to create and issue a new series of preferred stock and certain provisions of delaware law our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede a merger takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock which under certain circumstances could reduce the market price of our common stock and the value of any outstanding notes 

our ability to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to reduce future years taxes could be substantially limited under internal revenue code sections 382 and 383 if we experience an ownership change as defined in the internal revenue code section 382 

section 382 of the internal revenue code contains rules that limit the ability of a company to use its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in years after an ownership change which is generally defined as any change in ownership of more than 50 of its stock over a threeyear testing period these rules generally operate by focusing on ownership changes among stockholders owning directly or indirectly 5 or more of the stock of a company andor any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of stock by the company if as a result of future transactions involving our common stock including purchases or sales of stock by 5 stockholders we undergo cumulative ownership changes which exceed 50 over the testing period our ability to use our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards would be subject to additional limitations under sections 382 and 383 

generally if an ownership change occurs the annual taxable income limitation on the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is equal to the product of the applicable longterm taxexempt rate and the value of the companys stock immediately before the ownership change depending on the resulting limitation a portion of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards could expire before we would be able to use them 

our inability to fully utilize any net operating losses or tax credit carryforwards to reduce tax liability in the future could have a material and negative affect on our future financial position and results of operations

trends and factors affecting our business 

product release schedule our financial results are affected by the timing of our product releases and the commercial success of those titles our grand theft auto  products in particular have historically accounted for a significant portion of our revenue sales of grand theft auto  products generated 257  of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2019  in october 2018 we released red dead redemption 2  sales of red dead redemption  products generated 321  of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2019 the timing of our grand theft auto  or red dead redemption  product releases may affect our financial performance on a quarterly and annual basis 

economic environment and retailer performance we continue to monitor economic conditions that may unfavorably affect our businesses such as deteriorating consumer demand pricing pressure on our products credit quality of our receivables and foreign currency exchange rates our business is dependent upon a limited number of customers that account for a significant portion of our revenue our five largest customers accounted for 701  707  and 655  of net revenue during the fiscal years ended march 31 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively as of march 31 2019  and 2018  five customers comprised 666  and 654  of our gross accounts receivable respectively with our significant customers those that individually comprised more than 10 of our gross accounts receivable balance accounting for 558  and 532  of such balance at march 31 2019  and 2018  respectively we had two customers who accounted for 401  and 157  of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2019  and two customers who accounted for 377  and 155  of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2018  we did not have any additional customers that exceeded 10 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2019  and 2018  the economic environment has affected our customers in the past and may do so in the future bankruptcies or consolidations of our large retail customers could seriously hurt our business due to uncollectible accounts receivables and the concentration of purchasing power among the remaining large retailers certain of our large customers sell used copies of our games which may negatively affect our business by reducing demand for new copies of our games while the downloadable content that we now offer for certain of our titles may serve to reduce used game sales we expect used game sales to continue to adversely affect our business 

hardware platforms we derive most of our revenue from the sale of products made for video game consoles manufactured by third parties such as sonys ps4 and microsofts xbox one which comprised 837  of our net revenue by product platform for the fiscal year ended march 31 2019  the success of our business is dependent upon the consumer acceptance of these platforms and the continued growth in the installed base of these platforms when new hardware platforms are introduced demand for software used on older platforms typically declines which may negatively affect our business during the market transition to the new consoles we continually monitor console hardware sales we manage our product delivery on each current and future platform in a manner we believe to be most effective to maximize our revenue opportunities and achieve the desired return on our investments in product development accordingly our strategy is to focus our development efforts on a select number of the highest quality titles for these platforms while also expanding our offerings for emerging platforms such as tablets smartphones and online games 

online content and digital distribution the interactive entertainment software industry is delivering a growing amount of content through digital online delivery methods we provide a variety of online delivered products and offerings virtually all of our titles that are available through retailers as packaged goods products are also available through direct digital download from websites we own and others owned by third parties as well as a larger selection of our catalog titles in addition we aim to drive ongoing engagement and incremental revenue from recurrent consumer spending on our titles through virtual currency addon content and ingame purchases  we also publish an expanding variety of titles for tablets and smartphones which are delivered to consumers through digital download our results of operations discloses that net revenue from digital online channels comprised 630  of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2019  we expect online delivery of games and game offerings to continue to grow and to become an increasing part of our business over the longterm 

product releases 

we released the following key titles in fiscal year 2019

we have announced the following key titles to date this list does not represent all titles currently in development 



fiscal 2019  financial summary 

on april 1 2018 we adopted asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606  and related amendments the “new revenue accounting standard” using the modified retrospective method therefore no prior amounts have been restated in our tables and discussion below refer to note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for our accounting policy disclosure for revenue recognition in general the adoption of topic 606 results in a more accelerated revenue pattern due primarily to i the elimination of the requirement for vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe of fair value when allocating between multiple performance obligations and ii the change of our estimated service period to a user life however the impact on a given period may differ from this general trend in october 2018 we released red dead redemption 2 the acceleration of revenue for this title was material and is the primary component of the significant increases in certain of our operating results as a result of the adoption of topic 606 throughout the discussion in our results of operations below see notes 1 and 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information 

our net revenue for fiscal year ended march 31 2019  was led by titles from a variety of our top franchises primarily red dead redemption 2 grand theft auto  nba 2k  and wwe 2k  our net revenue increased  to 26684 million  an increase of 8755 million  or 488  compared to the fiscal year ended march 31 2018  this increase included a 7412 million  increase 

in net revenue as a result of the adoption of topic 606 as described above the remaining increase was driven by sales of the titles described above 

during the fiscal year ended march 31 2019  we recognized a tax benefit of 1071 million  from a reduction in our valuation allowance on certain us deferred tax assets as a result of a determination that it was morelikelythannot that such deferred tax assets would be realized our determination took into account the successful launch of red dead redemption 2  during the current fiscal year along with our recent positive trend of earnings

at march 31 2019  we had 13920 million  of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash compared to 12464 million  at march 31 2018  the increase  in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash from march 31 2018  was due primarily to net cash provided by operating activities from sales primarily of red dead redemption 2 partially offset by investments in software development and licenses as well as royalty payments these net increases were offset by net cash used in financing activities which was primarily related to repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program and tax payments related to net share settlements of our restricted stock and to a lesser extent net cash used in investing activities which was primarily related to bank time deposits and purchases of fixed assets 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our most critical accounting policies which are those that require significant judgment include revenue recognition price protection and allowances for returns capitalization and recognition of software development costs and licenses fair value estimates including valuation of goodwill intangible assets and longlived assets valuation and recognition of stockbased compensation and income taxes see note 1  basis of presentation and significant accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k

net bookings

for the fiscal year ended march 31 2019  net bookings increased  by 9381 million  as compared to the prior year period due primarily to red dead redemption 2 which released in october 2018 and our nba 2k franchise partially offset by a decrease from grand theft auto v and grand theft auto online

1 includes 149075  and 24610  of stockbased compensation expense in 2019  and 2018  respectively 

in general the adoption of topic 606 results in a more accelerated revenue pattern due primarily to i the elimination of the requirement for vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe of fair value when allocating between multiple performance obligations and ii the change of our estimated service period to a user life however the impact on a given period may differ from this general trend in october 2018 we released red dead redemption 2 the acceleration of revenue for this title due to the adoption of topic 606 was material and is the primary component of the significant increases as a result of the adoption of topic 606 throughout the discussion below see note 1 and note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information

provisionbenefit from income taxes 

we recognized a tax benefit of 1071 million  from a reduction in our valuation allowance on certain us deferred tax assets as a result of a determination that it was morelikelythannot that such deferred tax assets would be realized our determination took into account the successful launch of  red dead redemption 2 during the year along with our recent positive trend of earnings 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act herein referred to as the act” the act made broad and complex changes to the us tax code the act reduced the us federal corporate income tax rate from 35  to 21  effective january 1 2018 and required companies to pay a onetime transition tax on the previously untaxed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries in addition the act made other changes including but not limited to 1 a base erosion antiabuse tax beat which is a new minimum tax 2 generally eliminating us federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries 3 a new provision that taxes global intangible lowtaxed income gilti 4 the repeal of the domestic production activity deduction and 5 other base broadening provisions 

the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs acts  sab 118 which provides guidance on accounting for the acts impact sab 118 provides a measurement period which should not extend beyond one year from the act enactment date during which a company acting in good faith may complete the accounting for the impact of the act under asc 740 in accordance with sab 118 the income tax effects of the act must be reflected in the reporting period in which the accounting under asc topic 740 is complete we completed the accounting and recorded a decrease to income tax expense of 46 million  to adjust the provisional estimates related to the onetime transition tax on the previously untaxed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries as a result of the act the impact of the act differs from these estimates due to changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made guidance that was issued and actions taken as a result of the act 

the act subjects a us shareholder to current tax on gilti earned by foreign subsidiaries the fasb staff qa topic no 5 accounting for global intangible lowtaxed income  states that an entity can make an accounting policy election either to recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences that are expected to reverse as gilti in future years or provide for the tax expense related to gilti resulting from those items in the year the tax is incurred we have elected to recognize the resulting tax on gilti as an expense in the period incurred 

our income tax benefit was 1011 million  for the fiscal year ended march 31 2019  as compared to 369 million  for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018  

when compared to the statutory rate of 210  the effective tax rate of 434  for the fiscal year ended march 31 2019  was primarily due to a 1071 million  tax benefit from changes in valuation allowance a benefit of 350 million  for tax credits 

133 million  from excess tax benefits from employee stock compensation and 90 million  from our geographic mix of earnings partially offset by tax expense from other immaterial items which include the impact of the act 

when compared to the statutory rate of 316  the effective tax rate of 270  for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018  was primarily due to 532 million  from excess tax benefits from employee stock compensation as a component of the benefit from income taxes previously excess tax benefit and tax deficiencies were recognized in additional paidincapital a benefit of 226 million  for tax credits anticipated to be utilized a benefit of 151 million  from changes in unrecognized tax benefits primarily due to expiration of statute of limitations and a benefit of 79 million  from our geographic mix of earnings partially offset by provisional amounts recorded as a result of the act and 104 million  for changes in our valuation allowance 

the effective tax rate in the current year was lower compared to the prior year primarily due to a lower us statutory rate increased tax benefits from changes in valuation allowance increased tax benefits from tax credits reduced tax expense from the onetime transition tax partially offset by reduced benefits from excess tax benefits related to employee stock compensation and changes in unrecognized tax benefits 

we anticipate that additional excess tax benefits from employee stock compensation and tax credits could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate in future periods 

the accounting for sharebased compensation will increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our sharebased compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return which depends upon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting since we recognize excess tax benefits on a discrete basis we anticipate that our effective tax rate will vary from quarter to quarter depending on our stock price in each period 

on june 21 2018 the us supreme court issued its decision in south dakota v wayfair which overturned previous case law that precluded states from requiring retailers to collect sales tax on sales made to instate customers unless the retailer had physical presence in the state although this case is limited to sales tax collection obligations we continue to monitor the potential impact of this decision on our state income tax footprint 

the ultimate amount of tax payable in a given financial statement period may be materially affected by sudden or unforeseen changes in tax laws changes in the mix and level of earnings by taxing jurisdictions or changes to existing accounting rules or regulations for example on july 24 2018 the ninth circuit court of appeals issued an opinion in altera corp v commissioner requiring related parties in an intercompany costsharing arrangement to share expenses related to stock compensation on august 7 2018 the opinion was withdrawn to allow time for a reconstituted panel to confer we will continue to monitor ongoing developments and the final opinion could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

as of march 31 2019  we had gross unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties of 1390 million  of which 239 million  would affect our effective tax rate if realized for the fiscal year ended march 31 2019  gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by 105 million  

we are no longer subject to audit for us federal income tax returns for periods prior to our fiscal year ended march 31 2016 and state income tax returns for periods prior to the fiscal year ended march 31 2014 with few exceptions we are no longer subject to income tax examinations in nonus jurisdictions for years prior to fiscal year ended march 31 2013 certain us state and foreign taxing authorities are currently examining our income tax returns for the fiscal years ended march 31 2014 through march 31 2017 

we are regularly audited by domestic and foreign taxing authorities we believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable tax assessments it is possible that settlement of audits or the expiration of the statute of limitations may impact our effective tax rate in future periods

interest and other net 



interest and other net was income of 10 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018 as compared to an expense of 157 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2017 the increase was due primarily to a 207 million decrease in interest expense as a result of the settlement of our 175 convertible notes in december 2016 and higher gains on early conversions of our 100 convertible notes as well as higher interest income due to the nature of our investments and the rise of interest rates partially offset by foreign exchange transaction losses for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018 as compared to foreign exchange transaction gains in the prior year 

provisionbenefit from income taxes 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act herein referred to as the act” the act makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code that could materially affect us the act reduces the us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 effective january 1 2018 and requires companies to pay a onetime transition tax on the previously untaxed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries in addition the act makes other changes that may affect us beginning april 1 2018 these changes include but are not limited to 1 a base erosion antiabuse tax beat which is a new minimum tax 2 generally eliminating us federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries 3 a new provision that taxes global intangible lowtaxed income gilti 4 the repeal of the domestic production activity deduction and 5 other base broadening provisions 

the fasb staff qa topic 740 no 5 accounting for global intangible lowtaxed income  states that an entity can make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as gilti in future years or provide for the tax expense related to gilti in the year the tax is incurred given the complexity of the gilti provisions the company is still evaluating the effects of the gilti provisions and has not yet determined its accounting policy as of march 31 2018 the company is still evaluating the gilti provisions and analysis of future taxable income that is subject to gilti and therefore is unable to make a reasonable estimate and has not reflected any adjustments related to gilti in the consolidated financial statements 

we recorded an estimated increase to income tax expense of 181 million related to the onetime transition tax on the previously untaxed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries as a result of the act the estimated increase was a result of a transition tax of 266 million offset by increased benefits from domestic production deductions and tax credits in addition as a result of the decrease in the us federal corporate income tax rate from 35 to 21 we recorded a decrease to net deferred tax assets of 477 million and a corresponding decrease to the valuation allowance of 398 million after taking into account a portion of the deferred tax liability from indefinite lived intangibles as a source of income against deferred tax assets resulting in a tax benefit of 79 million the remeasurement of the deferred tax liability relating to indefinite lived intangibles due to the rate change resulted in a tax benefit of 62 million 

we are currently evaluating the potential impact of the act and the amounts recorded represent provisional estimates for certain identified income tax effects for which the accounting is incomplete but a reasonable estimate can be determined in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 118 sab 118 further analysis is required to review historical practices used to calculate the untaxed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries and additional time to evaluate the complexities of the new tax law along with additional interpretative guidance that may be issued the impact of the act may differ from these estimates possibly materially due to changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made guidance that may be issued and actions we may 

take as a result of the act we expect to continue to analyze the act and its impact and expect to record any adjustments to provisional estimates no later than the third quarter of fiscal 2019 

our income tax benefit was 369 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018 as compared to income tax expense of 97 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2017 

when compared to the statutory rate of 316 the effective tax rate of 270 for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018 was primarily due to 532 million from excess tax benefits from employee stock compensation as a component of the benefit from income taxes previously excess tax benefit and tax deficiencies were recognized in additional paidincapital a benefit of 226 million for tax credits anticipated to be utilized a benefit of 151 million from changes in unrecognized tax benefits primarily due to expiration of statute of limitations and a benefit of 79 million from our geographic mix of earnings partially offset by provisional amounts recorded as a result of the act and 104 million for changes in our valuation allowance 

the effective tax rate in the current year was lower compared to the prior year primarily due to 532 million from excess tax benefits related to employee stock compensation reflected as a component of the benefit from income taxes in the current year an increased benefit from changes in unrecognized tax benefits of 173 million primarily due to expiration of statute of limitations and 110 million of increased tax benefits due to mix of earnings partially offset by a reduced benefit from tax credits of 127 million and provisional amounts recorded as a result of the act 

we anticipate that additional excess tax benefits from employee stock compensation tax credits changes in valuation allowance and changes as a result of the act may arise in future periods which could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate 

the accounting for sharebased compensation will increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our sharebased compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return which depends upon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting since we recognize excess tax benefits on a discrete basis we anticipate that our effective tax rate will vary from quarter to quarter depending on our stock price in each period 

as of march 31 2018 we had gross unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties of 1285 million of which 228 million would affect our effective tax rate if realized for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018 gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by 83 million

we are subject to credit risks particularly if any of our receivables represent a limited number of customers or are concentrated in foreign markets if we are unable to collect our accounts receivable as they become due it could adversely affect our liquidity and working capital position 

generally we have been able to collect our accounts receivable in the ordinary course of business we do not hold any collateral to secure payment from customers we have trade credit insurance on the majority of our customers to mitigate accounts receivable risk 

a majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to major retailers and distributors our five largest customers accounted for 701  707  and 655  of net revenue during the fiscal years ended march 31 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively as of march 31 2019  and 2018  five customers accounted for 666  and 654  of our gross accounts receivable respectively customers that individually accounted for more than 10 of our gross accounts receivable balance comprised 558  and 532  of such balances at march 31 2019  and 2018  respectively we had two customers who accounted for 401  and 157  of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2019  and two customers who accounted for 377  and 155  of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2018  we did not have any additional customers that exceeded 10 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2019  and 2018  based upon performing ongoing credit evaluations maintaining trade credit insurance on a majority of our customers and our past collection experience we believe that the receivable balances from these largest customers do not represent a significant credit risk although we actively monitor each customers credit worthiness and economic conditions that may affect our customers business and access to capital we are monitoring the current global economic conditions including credit markets and other factors as it relates to our customers in order to manage the risk of uncollectible accounts receivable 

we believe our current cash shortterm investments and projected cash flow from operations along with availability under our new credit agreement will provide us with sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash requirements for working capital capital expenditures and commitments on both a shortterm and longterm basis 

as of march 31 2019  the amount of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the us by our foreign subsidiaries was 2927 million  these balances are dispersed across various locations around the world we believe that such dispersion meets 

the business and liquidity needs of our foreign affiliates in addition we expect to have the ability to generate sufficient cash domestically to support ongoing operations for the foreseeable future 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act” herein referred to as the act” the act made broad and complex changes to the us tax code which could materially affect us the act included a number of provisions including international provisions which generally establish a territorialstyle system for taxing foreign income of domestic multinational corporations our current intention is to reinvest indefinitely earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and therefore we have not recorded any tax liabilities associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings 

our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 142 million  shares of our common stock under this program we may purchase shares from time to time through a variety of methods including in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws repurchases are subject to the availability of stock prevailing market conditions the trading price of the stock our financial performance and other conditions the program does not require us to repurchase shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time for any reason during the fiscal years ended march 31 2019  2018  and 2017  we repurchased 37 million  15 million  and 00 million  shares of our common stock respectively in the open market for 3624 million  1548 million  and 00 million  respectively including commissions as part of the program as of march 31 2019  we had repurchased a total of 104 million  shares of our common stock under the program and 38 million  shares of our common stock remained available for repurchase under the share repurchase program 

our changes in cash flows were as follows 



at march 31 2019  we had 13920 million  of cash cash equivalents and restricted cash compared to 12464 million  at march 31 2018  the increase  in cash cash equivalents and restricted cash from march 31 2018  was due primarily to net cash provided by operating activities from sales primarily of red dead redemption 2 partially offset by investments in software development and licenses as well as royalty payments these net increases were offset by net cash used in financing activities which was primarily related to repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program and tax payments related to net share settlements of our restricted stock and to a lesser extent net cash used in investing activities which was primarily related to bank time deposits and purchases of fixed assets 

contractual obligations and commitments 

we have entered into various agreements in the ordinary course of business that require substantial cash commitments over the next several years generally these include 

• software development and licensing we make payments to thirdparty software developers that include contractual payments to developers under several software development agreements that expire at various times through march 2025  our aggregate outstanding software development commitments assume satisfactory performance by thirdparty software developers we also have licensing commitments that primarily consist of obligations to holders of intellectual property rights for use of their trademarks copyrights technology or other intellectual property rights in the development of our products 

• marketing we have certain minimum marketing support commitments where we commit to spend specified amounts related to marketing our products marketing commitments expire at various times through september 2024  

• operating leases our offices are occupied under noncancelable operating leases expiring at various times through december 2032  we also lease certain furniture equipment and automobiles under noncancelable leases expiring through june 2023  some of the leases have fixed rent increases and also include inducements to enter into the lease the effect of such amounts are deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the related lease term 

• purchase obligations  these obligations are primarily related to agreements to purchase services that are enforceable and legally binding on us that specifies all significant terms including fixed minimum or variable pricing provisions and the approximate timing of the transactions expiring at various times through march 2024  

a summary of annual minimum contractual obligations and commitments as of march 31 2019  is as follows in thousands of dollars 



income taxes  at march 31 2019  we had recorded a liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties of 239 million  for which we are unable to make a reasonable and reliable estimate of the period in which these liabilities will be settled with the respective tax authorities therefore these liabilities have not been included in the contractual obligations table 

legal and other proceedings  we are or may become subject to demands and claims including intellectual property claims and are involved in routine litigation in the ordinary course of business which we do not believe to be material to our business or financial statements we have appropriately accrued amounts related to certain of these claims and legal and other proceedings while it is reasonably possible that a loss may be incurred in excess of the amounts accrued in our financial statements we believe that such losses unless otherwise disclosed would not be material 

on february 7 2019 all of the previously disclosed lawsuits claims and counterclaims that had been pending since april 2016 with mr leslie benzies the former president of one of our subsidiaries were resolved 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of march 31 2019  and 2018  we did not have any material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial parties such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such we are not exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 

international operations 

net revenue earned outside of the united states is principally generated by our operations in europe asia australia canada and latin america for the fiscal years ended march 31 2019  2018  and 2017  465  413  and 439  respectively of our net revenue was earned outside the united states we are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade including increased credit risks tariffs and duties fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates shipping delays and international political regulatory and economic developments all of which can have a significant effect on our operating results 

fluctuations in quarterly operating results and seasonality 

we have experienced fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results as a result of the timing of the introduction of new titles variations in sales of titles developed for particular platforms market acceptance of our titles development and promotional expenses relating to the introduction of new titles sequels or enhancements of existing titles projected and actual changes in platforms the timing and success of title introductions by our competitors product returns changes in pricing policies by us and our competitors the accuracy of retailers forecasts of consumer demand the size and timing of acquisitions the timing of orders from major customers and order cancellations and delays in product shipment sales of our products are also seasonal with peak shipments typically occurring in the fourth calendar quarter as a result of increased demand for products during the holiday season for certain of our software products with multiple element revenue arrangements we defer the recognition of our net revenue over an estimated service period which generally ranges from 9 to 15 months as a result the quarter in which we generate the highest net sales volume may be different from the quarter in which we recognize the highest amount of net revenue quarterly comparisons of operating results are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential loss arising from fluctuations in market rates and prices our market risk exposures primarily include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates relates primarily to our shortterm investment portfolio and variable rate debt under the new credit agreement 

we seek to manage our interest rate risk by maintaining a shortterm investment portfolio that includes corporate bonds with high credit quality and maturities less than two years since shortterm investments mature relatively quickly and can be reinvested at the thencurrent market rates interest income on a portfolio consisting of shortterm securities is more subject to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longerterm maturities however the fair value of a shortterm portfolio is less sensitive to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longerterm securities we do not currently use derivative financial instruments in our shortterm investment portfolio our investments are held for purposes other than trading 

as of march 31 2019  we had 7445 million  of shortterm investments which included 3568 million  of availableforsale securities the availableforsale securities were recorded at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax in stockholders equity we also had 8265 million of cash and cash equivalents that are comprised primarily of money market funds and banktime deposits we determined that based on the composition of our investment portfolio there was no material interest rate risk exposure to our consolidated financial statements or liquidity as of march 31 2019  

historically fluctuations in interest rates have not had a significant effect on our operating results under our new credit agreement loans will bear interest at a rate of a 0250  to 0750  above a certain base rate  550  at march 31 2019  or b 1125 to 1750 above libor approximately 249  at march 31 2019  which rates are determined by reference to our consolidated total net leverage ratio changes in market rates may affect our future interest expense if there is an outstanding balance on our line of credit at march 31 2019  there were no outstanding borrowings under our new credit agreement 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we transact business in foreign currencies and are exposed to risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates accounts relating to foreign operations are translated into united states dollars using prevailing exchange rates at the relevant period end translation adjustments are included as a separate component of stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheets for the fiscal years ended march 31 2019  and 2018  our foreign currency translation adjustment was a loss  of 288 million  and a gain  of 434 million  respectively we recognized a foreign currency exchange transaction loss  of 05 million  a loss  of 30 million  and a gain  of 50 million for the fiscal years ended march 31 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively in interest and other net in our consolidated statements of operations 

balance sheet hedging activities 

we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with nonfunctional currency denominated cash balances and intercompany funding loans nonfunctional currency denominated accounts receivable and nonfunctional currency denominated accounts payable these transactions are not designated as hedging instruments and are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts is reported as either assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value are reported in interest and other net in our consolidated statements of operations we do not enter into derivative financial contracts for speculative or trading purposes at march 31 2019  we had 1166 million  of forward contracts outstanding to buy foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars and 878 million  of forward contracts outstanding to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars all of which have maturities of less than one year at march 31 2018  we had 44 million  of forward contracts outstanding to buy foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars and 676 million  of forward contracts outstanding to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars all of which have maturities of less than one year for the fiscal years ended march 31 2019  2018  and 2017  we recorded a gain  of 168 million  a loss  of 195 million  and a gain  of 72 million  respectively related to foreign currency forward contracts in interest and other net on the consolidated statements of operations as of march 31 2019  and 2018  the fair value of these outstanding forward contracts were losses of 04 million  and 00 million  respectively and is included in accrued and other current liabilities the fair value of these outstanding forward contracts is estimated based on the prevailing exchange rates of the various hedged currencies as of the end of the period 

our hedging programs are designed to reduce but do not entirely eliminate the effect of currency exchange rate movements we believe the counterparties to these foreign currency forward contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks and that the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign 

currency exchange rate risks there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations for the fiscal year ended march 31 2019  465  of our revenue was generated outside the united states using sensitivity analysis a hypothetical 10 increase in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would decrease revenue by 47  while a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would increase revenue by 47  in the opinion of management a substantial portion of this fluctuation would be offset by cost of goods sold and operating expenses incurred in local currency

we sell software titles both physically and digitally in the united states emea canada latin america and asia pacific through direct relationships with large retail customers and thirdparty distributors our top customers include among others gamestop corporation microsoft sony steam and walmart we have sales operations in australia canada france germany japan the netherlands new zealand singapore south korea spain taiwan the united kingdom and the united states 

we are dependent on a limited number of customers that account for a significant portion of our sales sales to our five largest customers during the fiscal year ended march 31 2018  accounted for 707  of our net revenue with sony and microsoft each accounting for more than 100 of our net revenue during the fiscal year ended march 31 2018  

we also distribute our titles addon content and microtransactions through direct digital download via the internet to consoles and pcs including smartphones and tablets we view digital distribution as an important growth opportunity for our industry and company however we expect that packaged goods and traditional retailers will continue to be a significant channel for the sale of our products for the foreseeable future 

marketing 

our marketing and promotional efforts are intended to maximize consumer interest in our titles promote brand name recognition of our franchises assist retailers and properly position package and merchandise our titles from time to time we also receive marketing support from hardware manufacturers in connection with their own promotional efforts 

we market titles by 

 as of march 31 2018  we had a sales and marketing staff of 434  people 

product procurement 

we procure products from suppliers principally using standard purchase orders based on our assessment of market demand we carry inventory quantities that we believe are necessary to provide rapid response to retailer orders we utilize electronic data interchange with many of our customers to enhance the efficiency of placing and shipping orders and receiving payments 

competition 

in our business we compete with 

 competition in the entertainment software industry is based on innovation features playability and product quality brand name recognition compatibility with popular platforms access to distribution channels price marketing and customer service our business is driven by hit titles which require increasing budgets for development and marketing competition for our titles is influenced by the timing of competitive product releases and the similarity of such products to our titles and may result in loss of shelf space or a reduction in sellthrough of our titles at retail stores 

trends and factors affecting our business 

product release schedule our financial results are affected by the timing of our product releases and the commercial success of those titles our grand theft auto  products in particular have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue sales of our grand theft auto  products generated 397  of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018  the timing of our grand theft auto  releases may affect our financial performance on a quarterly and annual basis 

economic environment and retailer performance we continue to monitor economic conditions that may unfavorably affect our businesses such as deteriorating consumer demand pricing pressure on our products credit quality of our receivables and foreign currency exchange rates our business is dependent upon a limited number of customers who account for a significant portion of our revenue our five largest customers accounted for 707  655  and 589  of net revenue during the fiscal years ended march 31 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively as of march 31 2018  and 2017  five customers comprised 654  and 699  of our gross accounts receivable respectively with our significant customers those that individually comprised more than 10 of our gross accounts receivable balance accounting for 532  and 576  of such balance at march 31 2018  and 2017  respectively we had two customers who accounted for 377  and 155  of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2018  and two customers who accounted for 402  and 174  of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2017  we did not have any additional customers that exceeded 10 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2018  and 2017  the economic environment has affected our customers in the past and may do so in the future bankruptcies or consolidations of our large retail customers could seriously hurt our business due to uncollectible accounts receivables and the concentration of purchasing power among the remaining large retailers certain of our large customers sell used copies of our games which may negatively affect our business by reducing demand for new copies of our games while the downloadable content that we now offer for certain of our titles may serve to reduce used game sales we expect used game sales to continue to adversely affect our business 

hardware platforms we derive most of our revenue from the sale of products made for video game consoles manufactured by thirdparties such as sonys ps4 and ps3 microsofts xbox one and xbox 360 and the nintendo switch which comprised 816  of our net revenue by product platform for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018  the success of our business is dependent upon the consumer acceptance of these platforms and the continued growth in the installed base of these platforms when new hardware platforms are introduced demand for software based on older platforms typically declines which may negatively affect our business during the market transition to the new consoles accordingly our strategy is to focus our development efforts on a select number of the highest quality titles for these platforms while also expanding our offerings for emerging platforms such as tablets smartphones and online games 

online content and digital distribution the interactive entertainment software industry is delivering a growing amount of content through digital online delivery methods we provide a variety of online delivered products and offerings virtually all of our titles that are available through retailers as packaged goods products are also available through direct digital download via the internet from websites we own and others owned by thirdparties in addition we aim to drive ongoing engagement and recurrent consumer spending on our titles after their initial purchase by generating incremental revenues through downloadable offerings including virtual currency addon content and microtransactions we also publish an expanding variety of titles for tablets and smartphones which are delivered to consumers through digital download via the internet note 17 to the consolidated financial statements segment and geographic information discloses that net revenue from digital online channels comprised 631  of our net revenue by distribution channel for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018  we expect online delivery of games and game offerings to become an increasing part of our business over the longterm 

international operations 

international sales are a significant part of our business for the fiscal years ended march 31 2018  2017  and 2016  413  439  and 474  respectively of our net revenue was earned outside the united states we are continuing to execute on our growth initiatives in asia where our strategy is to broaden the distribution of our existing products and expand our online gaming presence especially in china and south korea we are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade including increased credit risks tariffs and duties fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates shipping delays and international political regulatory and economic developments all of which can have a significant effect on our operating results see notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

segment and geographic information 

see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

employees 

as of march 31 2018  we had 4492  fulltime employees of which 2448  were employed outside of the united states none of our regular employees is subject to collective bargaining agreements we consider our relations with employees to be satisfactory 




 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties which may affect our future financial performance because of the risks and uncertainties described below as well as other factors affecting our operating results and financial condition past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and our business and financial performance could be harmed and the market value of our securities could decline 

risks relating to our business 

we are dependent on the future success of our grand theft auto products and we must continue to publish hit titles or sequels to such hit titles in order to compete successfully in our industry 

grand theft auto  and certain of our other titles are hit products and have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue grand theft auto  products contributed 397  of the companys net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018  and the five bestselling franchises including grand theft auto  which may change year over year in the aggregate accounted for 906  of the companys net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018  if we fail to continue to develop and sell new commercially successful hit titles or sequels to such hit titles or experience any delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of our hit titles or their sequels our revenue and profits may decrease substantially and we may incur losses in addition competition in our industry is intense and a relatively small number of hit titles account for a large portion of total revenue in our industry hit products offered by our competitors may take a larger share of consumer spending than we anticipate which could cause revenue generated from our products to fall below our expectations if our competitors develop more successful products or services at lower price points or based on payment models perceived as offering better value or if we do not continue to develop consistently high quality and wellreceived products and services our revenue and profitability may decline in addition both the online and mobile games marketplaces are characterized by frequent product introductions relatively low barriers to entry and new and evolving business methods technologies and platforms for development widespread consumer adoption of these new platforms for games and other technological advances in online or mobile game offerings could negatively affect our sales of console and traditional pc products before we have an opportunity to develop profitable businesses in such markets 

we are subject to product development risks which could result in delays and additional costs and we must adapt to changes in software technologies 

we depend on our internal development studios and thirdparty software developers to develop new interactive entertainment software within anticipated release schedules and cost projections the development cycle for new titles generally ranges from 12 months for annual sports releases to multiple years for certain of our topselling titles therefore our development costs can be substantial if we or our third party developers experience unanticipated development delays financial difficulties or additional costs we may not be able to release titles according to our schedule and at budgeted costs there can be no assurance that our products will be sufficiently successful so that we can recoup these costs or make a profit on these products 

additionally in order to stay competitive our internal development studios must anticipate and adapt to rapid technological changes affecting software development any inability to respond to technological advances and implement new technologies could render our products obsolete or less marketable further the failure to pursue the development of new technology platforms or business models that obtain meaningful commercial success in a timely manner may negatively affect our business resulting in increased production costs and more strenuous competition   

the inability of our products to achieve significant market acceptance delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of our products may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

new products may not achieve significant market acceptance generate sufficient sales or be introduced in a timely manner to permit us to recover development manufacturing and marketing costs associated with these products the life cycle of a title generally involves a relatively high level of sales during the first few months after introduction followed by a rapid decline in sales because sales associated with an initial product launch generally constitute a high percentage of the total sales associated with the life of a product delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of one or more new products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results and cause our operating results to be materially different from our expectations 

our business is subject to our ability to develop commercially successful products for the current video game platforms 

we derive most of our revenue from the sale of products made for video game platforms manufactured by third parties such as sonys ps4 and ps3 microsofts xbox one and xbox 360 and the nintendo switch which comprised 816  of the companys net revenue by product platform for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018  the success of our business is subject to the continued popularity of these platforms and our ability to develop commercially successful products for these platforms 

we may experience declines or fluctuations in the recurring portion of our business 

our business model includes revenue that we deem recurring in nature such as revenue from our annualized titles and associated services and ongoing mobile businesses while we have been able to forecast the revenue from these areas of our business with greater certainty than for new offerings we cannot provide assurances that consumers will purchase these games and services on a consistent basis furthermore we may cease to offer games and services that we previously had deemed to be recurring in nature consumer purchases of our games and services may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including their level of satisfaction with our games and services our ability to improve and innovate our annualized titles our ability to adapt our games and services to new platforms outages and disruptions of online services the games and services offered by our competitors our marketing and advertising efforts or declines in consumer activity generally as a result of economic downturns among others any decline or fluctuation in the recurring portion of our business may have a negative impact on our financial and operating results 

connectivity issues could affect our ability to sell and provide online services for our products and could affect our profitability 

we rely upon thirdparty digital delivery platforms such as microsofts xbox live playstation network steam and other thirdparty service providers to provide connectivity from the consumer to our digital products and our online services connectivity issues could prevent customers from accessing this content and our ability to successfully market and sell our products could be adversely affected in addition we could experience similar issues related to services we host on our internal servers such issues also could affect our ability to provide online services and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

our business could be adversely affected if our consumer data protection measures are not seen as adequate or there are breaches of our security measures or unintended disclosures of our consumer data 

we are collecting and storing consumer information including personal information we take measures to protect our consumer data from unauthorized access or disclosure it is possible that our security controls over consumer data may not prevent the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information in addition due to the high profile nature of our products we may draw a disproportionately higher amount of attention and attempts to breach our security controls than companies with lower profile products a security breach that leads to disclosure of consumer account information including personally identifiable information could harm our reputation compel us to comply with disparate breach notification laws in various jurisdictions and otherwise subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue a resulting perception that our products or services do not adequately protect the privacy of personal information could result in a loss of current or potential consumers and business partners in addition if any of our business partners experience a security breach that leads to disclosure of consumer account information our reputation could be harmed resulting in loss of revenue 

in addition certain of our products are online enabled the ability of our products to offer online functionality and our ability to offer content through a video game platforms digital distribution channel is dependent upon the continued operation and security of such platforms online network these third party networks as well as our own internal systems and websites and the security measures related thereto may be breached as a result of thirdparty action including intentional misconduct by computer hackers employee error malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers data or our data including our intellectual property and other confidential business information or our information technology systems because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs we may lose business suffer irreparable damage to our reputation andor incur significant costs and expenses relating to the investigation and possible litigation of claims relating to such event 

the laws and regulations concerning data privacy and certain other aspects of our business are continually evolving failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business 

we are subject to certain privacy and data protection laws including those in the united states certain activities related to eu customers are registered with our uk data controller the us childrens online privacy protection act also regulates the collection use and disclosure of personal information from children under 13 years of age failure to comply with privacy laws 

data protection laws or age restrictions may increase our costs subject us to expensive and distracting government investigations and result in substantial fines 

privacy and data protection laws are rapidly changing and likely will continue to do so for the foreseeable future which could have an impact on our approach to operating and marketing our games for example the court of justice of the european unions decision to invalidate the euus safe harbor regime that legitimized the transfer of certain personal data from the eu to the us was a material change to laws on data privacy applicable to our business in addition after four years of preparation and debate the eu parliament approved the general data protection regulation gdpr on april 14 2016 gdpr will become effective on may 25 2018 and will replace the existing data protection directive 9546ec the us government including the federal trade commission and the department of commerce also continue to review the need for greater or different regulation over the collection of personal information and information about consumer behavior on the internet and on mobile devices various government and consumer agencies worldwide have also called for new regulation and changes in industry practices 

player use of our games is subject to our privacy policy end user license agreements and terms of service if we fail to comply with our posted privacy policy eulas or terms of service or if we fail to comply with existing privacyrelated or data protection laws and regulations it could result in proceedings or litigation against us by governmental authorities or others which could result in fines or judgments against us damage our reputation affect our financial condition and harm our business if regulators the media or consumers raise any concerns about our privacy and data protection or consumer protection practices even if unfounded this could also result in fines or judgments against us damage our reputation negatively affect our financial condition and damage our business 

it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted or construed to apply to us in the united states and elsewhere that could restrict the interactive entertainment industry including player privacy advertising taxation content suitability copyright distribution and antitrust furthermore the growth and development of electronic commerce and virtual goods may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on companies such as ours conducting business through digital sales any such changes would require us to devote legal and other resources to address such regulation for example existing laws or new laws regarding the regulation of currency banking institutions and unclaimed property may be interpreted to cover virtual currency or virtual goods if that were to occur we may be required to seek licenses authorizations or approvals from relevant regulators the granting of which may be dependent on us meeting certain capital and other requirements and we may be subject to additional regulation and oversight all of which could significantly increase our operating costs changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the united states or elsewhere regarding these activities may lessen the growth of the interactive entertainment industry and impair our business financial condition and operating results 

although we have structured and operate our skill tournaments with applicable laws in mind including any applicable laws relating to gambling and believe that playing these games does not constitute gambling our skill tournaments could in the future become subject to gamblingrelated rules and regulations and expose us to civil and criminal penalties we also sometimes offer consumers of our online and casual games various types of contests and promotional opportunities we are subject to laws in a number of jurisdictions concerning the operation and offering of such activities and games many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business further some of our online games and other services include random digital item mechanics which may become subject to regulations in various jurisdictions if these were to occur we might be required to seek licenses authorizations or approvals from relevant regulators the granting of which may be dependent on us meeting certain capital and other requirements and we may be subject to additional regulation and oversight such as reporting to regulators all of which could significantly increase our operating costs changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the united states europe or elsewhere regarding these activities may lessen the growth of casual game services and impair our business 

security breaches involving the source code for our products or other sensitive and proprietary information could adversely affect our business 

we securely store the source code for our interactive entertainment software products as it is created a breach whether physical electronic or otherwise of the systems on which such source code and other sensitive data are stored could lead to damage or piracy of our software in addition certain parties with whom we do business are given access to our sensitive and proprietary information in order to provide services and support our team these third parties may misappropriate our information and engage in unauthorized use of it if we are subject to data security breaches we may have a loss in sales or increased costs arising from the restoration or implementation of additional security measures which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results any theft andor unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an event could adversely affect our competitive position reputation brand and future sales of our products our business could be subject to significant disruption and we could suffer monetary and other losses and reputational harm in the event of such incidents and claims 

we rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business any significant system or network disruption could have a negative impact on our business 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks some of which are within taketwo and some of which are managed andor hosted by thirdparty providers all information technology systems and networks are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources including but not limited to cyberattacks malicious software security breach energy blackouts natural disasters terrorism war and telecommunication failures we may also face sophisticated attacks referred to as advanced persistent threats which are cyberattacks aimed at compromising our intellectual property and other commerciallysensitive information such as the source code and game assets for our software or confidential customer or employee information which remain undetected for prolonged periods of time information technology system or network failure or security breach could negatively affect our business continuity operations and financial results these risks extend to the networks and ecommerce sites of console platform providers and other partners who sell and host our content online we may incur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions or security breaches 

successful exploitation of our systems can have other negative effects upon the products services and user experience we offer in particular the virtual economies that we have established in many of our games are subject to abuse exploitation and other forms of fraudulent activity that can negatively affect our business virtual economies involve the use of virtual currency andor virtual assets that can be used or redeemed by a player within a particular game or service the abuse or exploitation of our virtual economies include the illegitimate generation and sale of virtual items in black markets these kinds of activities and the steps that we take to address these issues may result in a loss of anticipated revenue interfere with players’ enjoyment of a balanced game environment and cause reputational harm 

our efforts to expand into new products and services may subject us to additional risks 

in recent years we have invested in emerging opportunities in interactive entertainment played on mobile platforms including tablets and smartphones and online platforms including social networks we have also grown our product offerings that are available through digital download including virtual currency through our existing franchises such as grant theft auto  and nba 2k  as well as through product offerings by newly acquired social point and other mobile product offerings we are actively investing to capitalize on these trends in order to diversify our product mix reduce our operating risks and increase our revenue there are risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed there is no assurance that we will be able to attract a sufficiently large number of customers or recover costs incurred for developing and marketing any of these new products or services for example we may offer games that do not attract sufficient purchases of virtual currency which may cause our investments into this product space such as through our acquisition of social point to fail to realize the expected benefits external factors such as competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also have an impact on the successful implementation of any new products or services failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we depend on our key management and product development personnel 

our continued success will depend to a significant extent on our senior management team and our relationship with zelnickmedia corporation zelnickmedia our executive chairmanchief executive officer and president are partners of zelnickmedia we are also highly dependent on the expertise skills and knowledge of certain of our rockstar employees and other key creative personnel responsible for content creation and development of our grand theft auto  titles and titles based on other brands we may not be able to continue to retain these personnel at current compensation levels or at all 

the loss of the services of our executive officers zelnickmedia our key rockstar employees or other key creative personnel could significantly harm our business in addition if one or more key employees were to join a competitor or form a competing company we may lose additional personnel experience material interruptions in product development delays in bringing products to market and difficulties in our relationships with licensors suppliers and customers which would significantly harm our business failure to continue to attract and retain other qualified management and creative personnel could adversely affect our business and prospects 

declines in consumer spending and other adverse changes in the economy could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

most of our products involve discretionary spending on the part of consumers we believe that consumer spending is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income this makes our products particularly sensitive to general economic conditions and economic cycles as consumers are generally more willing to make discretionary purchases including purchases of products like ours during periods in which favorable economic conditions prevail adverse economic conditions such as a prolonged us or international general economic downturn including periods of increased inflation unemployment levels tax rates interest rates energy prices or declining consumer confidence could also reduce consumer spending 

reduced consumer spending has and may in the future continue to result in reduced demand for our products and may also require increased selling and promotional expenses which has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results in addition during periods of relative economic weakness our consolidated credit risk reflecting our counterparty dealings with distributors customers capital providers and others may increase perhaps materially so furthermore uncertainty and adverse changes in the economy could also increase the risk of material losses on our investments increase costs associated with developing and publishing our products increase the cost and availability of sources of financing and increase our exposure to material losses from bad debts any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results if economic conditions worsen our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 

changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act herein referred to as the act” the act makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code that could materially affect us the act reduces the us federal corporate income tax rate from 35  to 21  effective january 1 2018 and requires companies to pay a onetime transition tax on the previously untaxed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries in addition the act makes other changes that may affect us beginning april 1 2018 these changes include but are not limited to 1 a base erosion antiabuse tax beat which is a new minimum tax 2 generally eliminating us federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries 3 a new provision that taxes global intangible lowtaxed income gilti 4 the repeal of the domestic production activity deduction and 5 other base broadening provisions 

we are currently evaluating the potential impact of the act on our tax provision it is possible that these changes could have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate tax payments financial condition or results of operations the new tax law is complex and additional interpretative guidance may be issued that could affect interpretations and assumptions we have made as well as actions we may take as a result of the act in addition numerous countries are evaluating their existing tax laws due in part to recommendations made by the organization for economic cooperation and development’s “oecd’s” base erosion and profit shifting “beps” project although we cannot predict whether or in what form any legislation based on such proposals may be adopted by the countries in which we do business future tax reform based on such proposals may increase the amount of taxes we pay and adversely affect our operating results and cash flows 

we are a multinational corporation with operations in the us and various other jurisdictions around the world accordingly we are subject to tax in the us and in various other jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are required to estimate future taxes although we currently believe our tax estimates are reasonable the estimation process is inherently uncertain and such estimates are not binding on tax authorities further our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by a variety of factors including changes in the business including the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in tax elections and changes in applicable tax laws additionally tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities and developments in those audits could adversely affect our income tax provision should the ultimate tax liability exceed estimates our income tax provision and net income or loss could be materially affected 

historically we recorded a valuation allowance against most of our us deferred tax assets we expect to provide a valuation allowance on future us tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability or until other significant positive evidence arises that suggests that these benefits are more likely than not to be realized 

we earn a significant amount of our operating income and continue to hold a significant portion of our cash outside the us we are reviewing whether the act will affect our existing intention to reinvest indefinitely earnings of our foreign subsidiaries the act imposes a onetime transition tax on the previously untaxed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries and other significant changes that affect how us companies are taxed on foreign earnings these changes may result in higher effective tax rates for us 

we are also required to pay taxes other than income taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the us and foreign jurisdictions we are regularly under examination by tax authorities with respect to these nonincome taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations changes in our business or changes in applicable tax law or interpretations will not have an adverse effect on our net income or loss and financial condition 

unclaimed property audits by governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results 

we are subject to unclaimed property escheat laws which require us to turn over to certain government authorities the property of others held by us that has been unclaimed for a specified period of time we are subject to audit by individual us states with regard to our escheatment practices the legislation and regulations related to unclaimed property matters tend to be complex and subject to varying interpretations by both government authorities and taxpayers although management believes that the positions 

we have taken are reasonable various taxing authorities may challenge certain of the positions we have taken which may also potentially result in additional liabilities for unclaimed property and interest in excess of accrued liabilities our positions are reviewed as events occur such as the availability of new information the lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations the measurement of additional estimated liability based on current calculations or the rendering of relevant court decisions an unfavorable resolution of assessments by a governmental authority could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future periods 

our quarterly operating results are dependent on the release of hit titles and are highly seasonal which may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate significantly 

we have experienced and may continue to experience wide fluctuations in quarterly operating results the release of a hit title typically leads to a high level of sales during the first few months after introduction followed by a rapid decline in sales in addition the interactive entertainment industry is highly seasonal with sales typically higher during the fourth calendar quarter due primarily to increased demand for games during the holiday season demand for and sales of titles in our nba 2k  series are also seasonal in that they are typically released just prior to the start of the nba season if a key event or sports season to which our product release schedule is tied were to be delayed or cancelled our sales might also suffer disproportionately our failure or inability to produce hit titles or introduce products on a timely basis to meet seasonal fluctuations in demand could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results the uncertainties associated with software development manufacturing lead times production delays and the approval process for products by hardware manufacturers and other licensors make it difficult to predict the quarter in which our products will ship and therefore may cause us to fail to meet financial expectations 

price protection granted to our customers and returns of our published titles by our customers may adversely affect our operating results 

we are exposed to the risk of price protection and product returns with respect to our customers our distribution arrangements with customers generally do not give them the right to return titles to us or to cancel firm orders however we sometimes accept product returns from our distribution customers for stock balancing and negotiate accommodations for customers which include credits and returns when demand for specific products falls below expectations we grant price protection and accept returns in connection with our publishing arrangements and revenue is recognized after deducting estimated price protection and reserves for returns while we believe that we can reliably estimate future price protection and returns if price protection and return rates for our products exceed our reserves our revenue could decline which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

increased sales of used video game products could lower our sales 

certain of our larger customers sell used video games which are generally priced lower than new video games if our customers increase their sales of used video games it could negatively affect our sales of new video games and have an adverse influence on our business financial condition and operating results 

a limited number of customers account for a significant portion of our sales the loss of a principal customer or other significant business relationship could seriously hurt our business 

a substantial portion of our product sales are made to a limited number of customers sales to our five largest customers during the fiscal year ended march 31 2018  accounted for 707  of our net revenue with sony and microsoft each accounting for more than 100 of our net revenue during the fiscal year ended march 31 2018  our sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders without longterm agreements or other commitments and our customers may terminate their relationship with us at any time certain of our customers may decline to carry products containing mature content the loss of our relationships with principal customers or a decline in sales to principal customers including as a result of a product being rated ao age 18 and over could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results in addition if our customers are subject to pricing pressures due to deteriorating demand for our products competitive pressure or otherwise such customers may pass those pricing pressures through to us which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

furthermore our customers may also be placed into bankruptcy become insolvent or be liquidated due to economic downturns global contractions of credit or for other factors bankruptcies or consolidations of certain large retail customers could seriously hurt our business including as a result of uncollectible accounts receivable from such customers and the concentration of purchasing power among remaining large retailers in addition our results of operations may be adversely affected if certain of our customers who purchase on credit terms are no longer eligible to purchase on such terms due to their financial distress which may reduce the quantity of products they demand from us 

if our marketing and advertising efforts fail to resonate with consumers our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 

our products are marketed worldwide through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs such as television and online advertising social media advertising print advertising retail merchandising website development and event sponsorship our ability to sell our products and services is dependent in part on the success of these programs if the marketing for our products and services fails to resonate with consumers particularly during the holiday season or other key selling periods or if advertising rates or other media placement costs increase these factors could have a material adverse influence on our business financial condition and operating results 

the interactive entertainment software industry is highly competitive 

we compete for both licenses to properties and the sale of interactive entertainment software with sony and microsoft each of which is a large developer and marketer of software for its own platforms we also compete with game publishers such as activision blizzard inc and electronic arts inc and ubisoft entertainment sa as our business is dependent upon our ability to develop hit titles which require increasing budgets for development and marketing the availability of significant financial resources has become a major competitive factor in developing and marketing software games some of our competitors have greater financial technical personnel and other resources than we do and are able to finance larger budgets for development and marketing and make higher offers to licensors and developers for commercially desirable properties our titles also compete with other forms of entertainment such as social media and casual games in addition to motion pictures television and audio and video products featuring similar themes online computer programs and other entertainment which may be less expensive or provide other advantages to consumers 

a number of software publishers who compete with us have developed and commercialized or are currently developing online games for use by consumers over the internet if technological advances significantly increase the availability of online games and if consumer acceptance of online gaming grows substantially it could result in a decline in our platformbased software sales and negatively affect sales of such products 

increased competition for limited shelf space and promotional support from retailers could affect the success of our business and require us to incur greater expenses to market our titles 

while digital sales are increasingly important to our business for physical sales retailers have limited shelf space and promotional resources and competition is intense among newly introduced interactive entertainment software titles for adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support competition for retail shelf space is expected to continue to increase which may require us to increase our marketing expenditures to maintain desirable sales levels of our titles competitors with more extensive lines and more popular titles may have greater bargaining power with retailers accordingly we may not be able or we may have to pay more than our competitors to achieve similar levels of promotional support and shelf space 

the increasing importance of digital sales to our business exposes us to the risks of that business model including greater competition 

the proportion of our revenues derived from digital content delivery as compared to traditional retail sales may continue to increase the increased importance of digital content delivery in our industry increases our potential competition as the minimum capital needed to produce and publish a digitally delivered game is significantly less than that needed to produce and publish one that is purchased through retail distribution and is played on a game console this will also require us to dedicate capital to developing and implementing alternative marketing strategies which we may not do successfully if either occurs we may be unable to effectively market and distribute our products which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results in addition a continuing shift to digital delivery could result in a deprioritization of our products by traditional retailers the increasing importance of digital sales to our business could also result in increasing issues with our digital distribution process including difficulties our distributors have with collecting from consumers and any associated rebates we would owe 

our business is partly dependent on our ability to enter into successful software development arrangements with thirdparties 

our success depends on our ability to continually identify and develop new titles on a timely basis we rely on thirdparty software developers for the development of some of our titles quality thirdparty developers are continually in high demand software developers who have developed titles for us in the past may not be available to develop software for us in the future due to the limited number of thirdparty software developers and the limited control that we exercise over them these developers may not be able to complete titles for us on a timely basis or within acceptable quality standards if at all we have entered into agreements with thirdparties to acquire the rights to publish and distribute interactive entertainment software as well as to use licensed intellectual properties in our titles these agreements typically require us to make development payments pay royalties and satisfy other conditions our development payments may not be sufficient to permit developers to develop new software successfully which could result in material delays and significantly increase our costs to bring particular products to market software development costs promotion and marketing expenses and royalties payable to software developers and thirdparty licensors have increased significantly in recent years and reduce potential profits derived from sales of our software future sales of our titles may not be sufficient to recover development payments and advances to software developers and licensors and we may not have 

adequate financial and other resources to satisfy our contractual commitments to such developers if we fail to satisfy our obligations under agreements with thirdparty developers and licensors the agreements may be terminated or modified in ways that are burdensome to us and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we cannot publish our titles without the approval of hardware licensors that are also our competitors 

we are required to obtain licenses from certain of our competitors including sony and microsoft to develop and publish titles for their respective hardware platforms our existing platform licenses require that we obtain approval for the publication of new titles on a titlebytitle basis as a result the number of titles we are able to publish for these hardware platforms our ability to manage the timing of the release of these titles and accordingly our net revenue from titles for these hardware platforms may be limited if a licensor chooses not to renew or extend our license agreement at the end of its current term or if a licensor were to terminate our license for any reason or does not approve one or more of our titles we may be unable to publish that title as well as additional titles for that licensors platform termination of any such agreements or disapproval of titles could seriously hurt our business and prospects we may be unable to continue to enter into license agreements for certain current generation platforms on satisfactory terms or at all failure to enter into any such agreement could also seriously hurt our business 

we rely on a limited number of channel partners some of whom influence the fee structures for online distribution of our games on their platforms 

we rely on a limited number of channel partners some of whom have retained the right to change the fee structures for online distribution of both paid content and free content including patches and corrections that we license to them for distribution on their platforms such channel partners ability to set or influence royalty rates may increase costs which could negatively affect our operating margins we may be unable to distribute our content in a costeffective or profitable manner through such distribution channel which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

outside of fee arrangements our agreements with our channel partners sometimes give them significant control over other aspects of the distribution of our products and services that we develop for their platform if our channel partners establish terms that restrict our offerings through their channels or significantly affect the financial terms on which these products or services are offered to our customers we may be unable to distribute our product offerings through them or be forced to do so on a materially worse financial or business terms 

we may not be able to adequately adjust our cost structure in a timely fashion in response to a sudden decrease in demand 

in the event of a significant decline in revenue we may not be able to dispose of facilities reduce personnel or make other changes to our cost structure without disruption to our operations or without significant termination and exit costs management may not be able to implement such actions in a timely manner if at all to offset an immediate shortfall in revenue and profit moreover reducing costs may impair our ability to produce and develop software titles at sufficient levels in the future 

we use open source software in connection with certain of our games and services which may pose particular risks to our proprietary software products and services in a manner that could have a negative impact on our business 

we use open source software in connection with certain of our games and the services we offer some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software or make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost the terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by courts and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our use of the open source software were it determined that our use was not in compliance with a particular license we may be required to release our proprietary source code pay damages for breach of contract reengineer our games discontinue distribution in the event reengineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our game development efforts any of which could harm our business 

we depend on servers and internet bandwidth to operate our games and digital services with online features if we were to lose server capacity or lack sufficient internet bandwidth for any reason our business could suffer 

we rely on data servers including those owned or controlled by third parties to enable our customers to download our games and other downloadable content and to operate our online games and other products with online functionality events such as limited hardware failure any broadbased catastrophic server malfunction a significant intrusion by hackers that circumvents security measures or a failure of disaster recovery services would likely interrupt the functionality of our games with online services and could result in a loss of sales for games and related services an extended interruption of service could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we expect a significant portion of our games to be online enabled in the future and therefore we must project our future server needs and make advance purchases of servers or server capacity to accommodate expected business demands if we underestimate 

the amount of server capacity our business requires or if our business were to grow more quickly than expected our consumers may experience service problems such as slow or interrupted gaming access insufficient server capacity may result in decreased sales a loss of our consumer base and adverse consequences to our reputation conversely if we overestimate the amount of server capacity required by our business we may incur additional operating costs 

because of the potential importance of our online business to our revenues and results of operations our ability to access adequate internet bandwidth and online computational resources to support our business is critical if the price of either such resource increases we may not be able to increase our prices or subscriber levels to compensate for such costs which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we submit our products for rating by the entertainment software rating board esrb in the united states and other voluntary or government ratings organizations in foreign countries failure to obtain a target rating for certain of our products could negatively affect our ability to distribute and sell those games as could the rerating of a game for any reason 

we voluntarily submit our game products to the esrb a usbased nonprofit and independent ratings organization the esrb system provides consumers with information about game content using a rating symbol that generally suggests the appropriate player age group and specific content descriptors such as graphic violence profanity or sexually explicit material the esrb may impose significant penalties on game publishers for violations of its rules related to rating or marketing games including revocation of a rating or monetary fines other countries require voluntary or government backed ratings as prerequisites for product sales in some instances we may have to modify our products in order to market them under the target rating which could delay or disrupt the release of our products in addition some of our titles may not be sold at all or without extensive edits in certain countries such as germany 

in the united states if the esrb rates a game as ao age 18 and older platform licensors may not certify the game and retailers may refuse to sell it in addition some consumers have reacted to reratings or controversial game content by refusing to purchase such games demanding refunds for games that they had already purchased and refraining from buying other games published by us many of our rockstar titles and certain of our 2k titles have been rated m age 17 and older by the esrb if we are unable to obtain m ratings and instead receive ao ratings on future versions of those or similar titles as a result of changes in the esrbs ratings standards or for other reasons including the adoption of legislation in this area our business and prospects could be negatively affected if any of our games are rerated by the esrb or other foreign based ratings organizations we could be exposed to litigation administrative fines and penalties and other potential liabilities and our operating results and financial condition could be significantly affected 

we have implemented processes to comply with the requirements of the esrb and other ratings organizations and properly display the designated rating symbols and content descriptions nonetheless these processes are subject to human error circumvention overriding and reasonable resource constraints if a video game we published were found to contain undisclosed pertinent content the esrb could rerate a game retailers could refuse to sell it and demand that we accept the return of any unsold copies or returns from customers and consumers could refuse to buy it or demand that we refund their money this could have a material negative affect on our operating results and financial condition in addition we may be exposed to litigation administrative fines and penalties and our reputation could be harmed which could affect sales of other video games we sell if any of these consequences were to occur our business and financial performance could be significantly harmed 

content policies adopted by retailers consumer opposition and litigation could negatively affect sales of our products 

retailers may decline to sell interactive entertainment software containing what they judge to be graphic violence or sexually explicit material or other content that they deem inappropriate for their businesses if retailers decline to sell our products based upon their opinion that they contain objectionable themes graphic violence or sexually explicit material or other generally objectionable content or if any of our previously m rated series products are rated ao we might be required to significantly change or discontinue particular titles or series which in the case of our bestselling grand theft auto  titles could seriously affect our business consumer advocacy groups have opposed sales of interactive entertainment software containing objectionable themes violence or sexual material or other objectionable content by pressing for legislation in these areas and by engaging in public demonstrations and media campaigns additionally although lawsuits seeking damages for injuries allegedly suffered by thirdparties as a result of video games have generally been unsuccessful in the courts claims of this kind have been asserted against us from time to time and may be asserted and be successful in the future an increase in the number of lawsuits filed by the families of victims of violence may trigger supplemental governmental scrutiny damage our reputation and negatively affect the sale of our products 

our results of operations or reputation may be harmed as a result of offensive consumercreated content 

we are subject to risks associated with the collaborative online features in our games which allow consumers to post narrative comments in real time that are visible to other consumers from time to time objectionable and offensive consumer content may be posted to a gaming or other site with online chat features or game forums which allow consumers to post comments we may 

be subject to lawsuits governmental regulation or restrictions and consumer backlash including decreased sales and harmed reputation as a result of consumers posting offensive content we may also be subject to consumer backlash from comments made in response to postings we make on social media sites such as facebook youtube and twitter 

we are subject to risks and uncertainties of international trade including fluctuations in the values of local foreign currencies against the dollar 

sales in international markets primarily in europe have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018  413  of our net revenue was earned outside the united states we are continuing to execute on our growth initiatives in asia where our strategy is to broaden the distribution of our existing products and expand our online gaming presence especially in china and south korea we are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade including increased credit risks tariffs and duties fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates shipping delays and international political regulatory and economic developments all of which can have a significant influence on our operating results many of our international sales are made in local currencies which could fluctuate against the dollar while we may use forward exchange contracts to a limited extent to seek to mitigate foreign currency risk our operating results could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations 

we face risks from our international operations 

we are subject to certain risks because of our international operations particularly as we continue to grow our business and presence in asia latin america and other parts of the world changes to and compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations may increase our cost of doing business and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals could harm our international and domestic sales trade legislation in either the united states or other countries such as a change in the current tariff structures importexport compliance laws or other trade laws or policies could adversely affect our ability to sell or to distribute in international markets we incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our international operations and could become subject to legal penalties in foreign countries if we do not comply with local laws and regulations which may be substantially different from those in the united states in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it may be common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by united states laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and by local laws such as laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations including those based in or from countries where practices which violate such laws may be customary will not take actions in violation of our policies any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could have a material adverse effect on our business 

on june 23 2016 the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” on march 29 2017 the uk notified the european council in accordance with article 50 of the treaty on european union of the uk’s intention to withdraw from the european union as a result the british government has begun negotiating the terms of the uk’s future relationship with the eu the effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the uk makes to retain access to the eu markets either during a transitional period or more permanently the measures could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and may cause us to lose customers distributors and employees if the uk loses access to the single eu market and the global trade deals negotiated by the eu it could have a detrimental impact on our uk growth such a decline could also make our doing business in europe more difficult which could negatively affect sales to consumers of our products without access to the single eu market it may be more challenging and costly to distribute our products in europe in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace and replicate if there are changes to uk immigration policy as a result of brexit this could affect our employees and their ability to move freely between the eu member states for work related matters 

if we are unable to protect the intellectual property relating to our software the commercial value of our products will be adversely affected and our competitive position could be harmed 

we develop proprietary software and have obtained the rights to publish and distribute software developed by thirdparties we attempt to protect our software and production techniques under patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as through contractual restrictions on disclosure copying and distribution nonetheless our software is susceptible to piracy and unauthorized copying and thirdparties may potentially exploit or misappropriate our intellectual property and proprietary information causing significant reputational damage unauthorized thirdparties for example may be able to copy or to reverse engineer our software to obtain and use programming or production techniques that we regard as proprietary well organized piracy operations have also proliferated in recent years resulting in the ability to download pirated copies of our software over the internet although we attempt to incorporate protective measures into our software piracy of our products could negatively affect our future profitability in addition cheating programs or other unauthorized software tools and modifications that enable consumers to cheat in games harm the experience of players who play fairly and could negatively impact the volume of microtransactions or purchases of downloadable content also vulnerabilities in the design of our applications and of the platforms upon which they 

run could be discovered after their release this may lead to lost revenues from paying consumers or increased cost of developing technological measures to respond to these either of which could negatively affect our business 

if we infringe on or are alleged to infringe on the intellectual property rights of thirdparties our business could be adversely affected 

as our industry grows we may be subject to an increasing amount of litigation that is common in the software industry based on allegations of infringement or other alleged violations of patent copyright andor trademarks in addition we believe that interactive entertainment software will increasingly become the subject of claims that such software infringes on the intellectual property rights of others with both the growth of online functionality and advances in technology game content and software graphics as games become more realistic from time to time we receive notices from thirdparties or are named in lawsuits by thirdparties alleging infringement of their proprietary rights although we believe that our software and technologies and the software and technologies of thirdparty developers and publishers with whom we have contractual relations do not and will not infringe or violate proprietary rights of others it is possible that infringement of proprietary rights of others may occur any claims of infringement with or without merit could be time consuming costly and difficult to defend moreover intellectual property litigation or claims could require us to discontinue the distribution of products obtain a license or redesign our products which could result in additional substantial costs and material delays 

our software is susceptible to errors which can harm our financial results and reputation 

the technological advancements of new hardware platforms result in the development of more complex software products as software products become more complex the risk of undetected errors in new products increases we may need to produce and distribute patches in order to repair such errors which could be costly and may distract our developers from working on new products if despite testing errors are found in new products or releases after shipments have been made we may have to consider suspending distribution of defective products or offering refunds and we could experience a loss of or delay in timely market acceptance product returns loss of revenue increases in costs relating to the repair of such errors and damage to our reputation 

if we acquire or invest in other businesses intellectual properties or other assets we may be unable to integrate them with our business our financial performance may be impaired andor we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for such transactions 

if appropriate opportunities present themselves we may acquire or make investments in businesses intellectual properties and other assets that we believe are strategic we may not be able to identify negotiate or finance any future acquisition or investment successfully even if we do succeed in acquiring or investing in a business intellectual property or other asset such acquisitions and investments involve a number of risks including 



 future acquisitions and investments could also involve the issuance of our equity and equitylinked securities potentially diluting our existing stockholders the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses writeoffs of goodwill intangibles or acquired inprocess technology or other increased cash and noncash expenses such as stockbased compensation any of the foregoing factors could harm our financial condition or prevent us from achieving improvements in our financial condition and operating performance that could have otherwise been achieved by us on a standalone basis our stockholders may not have the opportunity to review vote on or evaluate future acquisitions or investments 

our ability to acquire and maintain licenses to intellectual property especially for sports titles affects our revenue and profitability competition for these licenses may make them more expensive and increase our costs 

certain of our products are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others for example certain of our 2k products include rights licensed from major sports leagues and players associations similarly some of our other titles are based on licenses of popular entertainment products competition for these licenses is intense if we are unable to maintain and renew these licenses or obtain additional licenses on reasonable economic terms or with significant commercial value our revenue and profitability could decline significantly competition for these licenses may also increase the advances guarantees and royalties that we must pay to the licensor which could significantly increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability in addition on certain intellectual property licenses we are subject to guaranteed minimum payments royalties or standards of performance and may not be able to terminate these agreements prior to their stated expiration if such licensed products do not generate revenues in excess of such minimum guarantees our profitability will be adversely affected 

we are subject to contractual covenants which place certain limitations on how we manage our business  

our second amended and restated credit agreement as amended the credit agreement and the indentures governing our 100 convertible notes due 2018 issued in june 2013 the 100 convertible notes may limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt paying dividends repurchasing shares and acquiring or disposing of assets or businesses in addition we have granted a security interest in connection with certain compensatory arrangements which limits our ability to incur senior debt in excess of certain amounts accordingly we may be restricted from taking actions that management believes would be desirable and in the best interests of us and our stockholders our credit agreement and the indentures also require us to satisfy specified financial and nonfinancial covenants a breach of any of the covenants contained in our credit agreement could result in an event of default under the agreement and under the indentures governing our 100 convertible notes and would allow our lenders and noteholders to pursue various remedies including accelerating the repayment of any outstanding indebtedness 

our business and products are subject to potential legislation the adoption of such proposed legislation could limit the retail market for our products 

several proposals have been made for federal legislation to regulate our industry such proposals seek to prohibit the sale of products containing certain content included in some of our games if any such proposals are enacted into law it may limit the potential market for some of our games in the united states and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results other countries such as germany have adopted laws regulating content both in packaged games and those transmitted over the internet that are stricter than current united states laws in the united states proposals have also been made by numerous state legislators to regulate and prohibit the sale of interactive entertainment software products containing certain types of violent or sexual content to under 17 or 18 audiences such as the state of californias ultraviolent video games law that sought to ban the sale or rental of violent video games to minors while such legislation to date has been enjoined by industry and retail groups or been found unconstitutional the adoption into law of such legislation in federal andor in state jurisdictions in which we do significant business could severely limit the retail market for some of our games 

change in government regulations relating to the internet could have a negative impact on our business 

we rely on our consumers access to significant levels of internet bandwidth for the sale and digital delivery of our content and the functionality of our games with online features changes in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth popularity or use of the internet including laws affecting net neutrality could decrease the demand for our products and services or increase our cost of doing business although certain jurisdictions have implemented laws and regulations intended to prevent internet service providers from discriminating against particular types of legal traffic on their networks other jurisdictions may lack such laws and regulations or repeal existing laws or regulations for example on december 14 2017 the federal communications 

commission voted to repeal net neutrality regulations in the us given uncertainty around these rules including changing interpretations amendments or repeal coupled with the potentially significant political and economic power of local internet service providers and the relatively significant level of internet bandwidth access our products and services require we could experience discriminatory or anticompetitive practices that could impede our growth cause us to incur additional expenses or otherwise negatively affect our business 

we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill becomes impaired 

we are required under us generally accepted accounting principles to review our goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating a requirement to reevaluate whether our goodwill continues to be recoverable include a significant decline in stock price and market capitalization slower growth rates in our industry or other materially adverse events we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill is determined this may adversely affect our operating results 

our reported financial results could be adversely affected by the application of existing or future accounting standards to our business as it evolves 

our reported financial results are affected by the accounting policies promulgated by the sec and national accounting standards bodies and the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies for example standards regarding revenue recognition have and could further significantly affect the way we account for revenue related to our products and services we expect that an increasing number of our games will be supported with material postrelease activities such as content updates and onlineenabled features and we could therefore be required to recognize more of the related revenues for those games over a period of time rather than at the time of sale further as we increase our downloadable content and add new features to our online services user playing patterns can affect our estimate of the service period may change and we could be required to recognize revenues and defer related costs over a shorter or longer period of time than we initially allocated as we enhance expand and diversify our business and product offerings the application of existing or future financial accounting standards particularly those relating to the way we account for revenue could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results although not necessarily on our cash flows 

risks relating to our common stock 

for purposes of this section risks relating to our common stock references to the company we our and us refer only to taketwo interactive software inc and not to its subsidiaries 

additional issuances or sales of equity securities by us would dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

we may issue equity or equitybased securities such as our 100 convertible notes in the future in connection with acquisitions or strategic transactions to adjust our ratio of debt to equity including through repayment of outstanding debt to fund expansion of our operations or for other purposes to the extent we issue additional equity securities including upon conversion of our outstanding 100 convertible notes the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders would be reduced the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect its price the sale or the availability for sale of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause the price of our common stock to decline the issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of our 100 convertible notes could also adversely affect the price of our common stock 

there is no guarantee that we will do additional share repurchases in the future 

the share repurchase program authorized by the board of directors which authorized the repurchase of up to 142 million  shares of our common stock and had 59 million  shares available for repurchase as of the date of this filing does not obligate the company to make any purchases at any specific time or situation discontinuing repurchases could adversely affect the price of the companys common stock the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time for any reason 

our stock price has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly 

the market price of our common stock historically has been and we expect will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us including those discussed in the risk factors in this section as well as others not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material to changes in securities analysts earnings estimates or ratings to our results or future financial guidance falling below our expectations and analysts and investors expectations to factors affecting the computer software entertainment media or electronics industries or to national or international economic conditions 

stock markets in general have experienced over the years and continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected market prices for companies such as ours and that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the affected companies these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock regardless of our operating performance 

delaware law our charter documents and provisions of our debt agreements may impede or discourage a takeover which could cause the market price of our shares to decline 

we are a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a thirdparty to acquire control of us even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders our board of directors has the power without stockholder approval to adopt a stockholder rights plan andor to designate the terms of one or more series of preferred stock and issue shares of preferred stock the ability of our board of directors to create and issue a new series of preferred stock and certain provisions of delaware law our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede a merger takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock which under certain circumstances could reduce the market price of our common stock and the value of any outstanding notes 

our ability to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to reduce future years taxes could be substantially limited under internal revenue code sections 382 and 383 if we experience an ownership change as defined in the internal revenue code section 382 

section 382 of the internal revenue code contains rules that limit the ability of a company to use its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in years after an ownership change which is generally defined as any change in ownership of more than 50 of its stock over a threeyear testing period these rules generally operate by focusing on ownership changes among stockholders owning directly or indirectly 5 or more of the stock of a company andor any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of stock by the company if as a result of future transactions involving our common stock including purchases or sales of stock by 5 stockholders we undergo cumulative ownership changes which exceed 50 over the testing period our ability to use our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards would be subject to additional limitations under sections 382 and 383 

generally if an ownership change occurs the annual taxable income limitation on the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is equal to the product of the applicable longterm tax exempt rate and the value of the companys stock immediately before the ownership change depending on the resulting limitation a portion of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards could expire before we would be able to use them 

our inability to fully utilize any net operating losses or tax credit carryforwards to reduce tax liability in the future could have a material and negative affect on our future financial position and results of operations

we are or may become subject to demands and claims including intellectual property claims and are involved in routine litigation in the ordinary course of business which we do not believe to be material to our business or financial statements we have appropriately accrued amounts related to certain of these claims and legal and other proceedings while it is reasonably possible that a loss may be incurred in excess of the amounts accrued in our financial statements we believe that such losses unless otherwise disclosed would not be material 

on april 11 2016 we filed a declaratory judgment action in the united states district court for the southern district of new york seeking among other things a judicial declaration that leslie benzies the former president of one of our subsidiaries with whom we had been in ongoing discussions regarding his separation of employment is not entitled to any minimum allocation or financial parity with any other person under the applicable royalty plan we believe we will prevail in this matter although there can be no assurance of the outcome on april 12 2016 mr benzies filed a complaint in the supreme court of the state of new york new york county against us and certain of our subsidiaries and employees we removed this case to the united states district court for the southern district of new york but the case was subsequently remanded to state court the complaint claims damages of at least 150 million and contains allegations of breach of fiduciary duty fraudulent inducement and fraudulent concealment aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty breach of various contracts breach of implied duty of good faith and fair dealing tortious interference with contract unjust enrichment reformation constructive trust declaration of rights constructive discharge defamation and fraud we have asserted counterclaims for breach of contract theft of trade secrets and misappropriation

trends and factors affecting our business 

product release schedule our financial results are affected by the timing of our product releases and the commercial success of those titles our grand theft auto  products in particular have historically accounted for a significant portion of our revenue sales of grand theft auto  products generated 397  of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018  the timing of our grand theft auto  product releases may affect our financial performance on a quarterly and annual basis 

economic environment and retailer performance we continue to monitor economic conditions that may unfavorably affect our businesses such as deteriorating consumer demand pricing pressure on our products credit quality of our receivables and foreign currency exchange rates our business is dependent upon a limited number of customers that account for a significant portion of our revenue our five largest customers accounted for 707  655  and 589  of net revenue during the fiscal years ended march 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively as of march 31 2018  and 2017  five customers comprised 654  and 699  of our gross accounts receivable respectively with our significant customers those that individually comprised more than 10 of our gross accounts receivable balance accounting for 532  and 576  of such balance at march 31 2018  and 2017  respectively we had two customers who accounted for 377  and 155  of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2018  and two customers who accounted for 402  and 174  of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2017  we did not have any additional customers that exceeded 10 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2018  and 2017  the economic environment has affected our customers in the past and may do so in the future bankruptcies or consolidations of our large retail customers could seriously hurt our business due to uncollectible accounts receivables and the concentration of purchasing power among the remaining large retailers certain of our large customers sell used copies of our games which may negatively affect our business by reducing demand for new copies of our games while the downloadable content that we now offer for certain of our titles may serve to reduce used game sales we expect used game sales to continue to adversely affect our business 

hardware platforms we derive most of our revenue from the sale of products made for video game consoles manufactured by thirdparties such as sonys ps4 and ps3 microsofts xbox one and xbox 360 and the nintendo switch which comprised 816  of our net revenue by product platform for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018  the success of our business is dependent upon the consumer acceptance of these consoles and continued growth in their installed base when new hardware platforms are introduced demand for software used on older platforms typically declines which may negatively affect our business during the market transition to the new consoles we continually monitor console hardware sales we manage our product delivery on each current and future platform in a manner we believe to be most effective to maximize our revenue opportunities and achieve the desired return on our investments in product development accordingly our strategy is to focus our development efforts on a select number of the highest quality titles for these platforms while also expanding our offerings for emerging platforms such as tablets smartphones and online games 

online content and digital distribution the interactive entertainment software industry is delivering a growing amount of content through digital online delivery methods we provide a variety of online delivered products and offerings most of our titles that are available through retailers as packaged goods products are also available through direct digital download from websites we own and others owned by thirdparties in addition we aim to drive ongoing engagement and incremental revenue from recurrent consumer spending on our titles after their initial purchase through downloadable offerings including addon content microtransactions and online play we also publish an expanding variety of titles for tablets and smartphones which are delivered to consumers through digital download via the internet our results of operations discloses that net revenue from digital online channels comprised 631  of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018  we expect online delivery of games and game offerings to continue to grow and to become an increasing part of our business over the longterm

net revenue from console games increased  by 226 million  and accounted for 816  of our total net revenue in the fiscal year ended march 31 2018  as compared to 810  in the prior year the increase in net revenue from console games was due primarily to higher net revenue from our nba 2k  franchise partially offset by lower net revenues from mafia iii which released in october 2016 net revenue from pc and other decreased  by 94 million  as compared to the prior year and decreased as a percentage of net revenue to 184  compared to 190  in the prior year the decrease in net revenue from pc and other was due primarily to lower net revenue from civilization vi  which released on the pc in the prior year partially offset by higher net revenue from social point titles for which we had only two months of net revenue in the prior year as it was acquired in january 2017 

net revenue from digital online channels increased  by 2092 million  and accounted for 631  of our total net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018  as compared to 518  in the prior year the increase in net revenue from digital online channels was due primarily to higher revenue related to our nba 2k  franchise and grand theft auto online partially offset by lower net revenue from civilization vi and grand theft auto v  net revenue from physical retail and other channels decreased  by 1961 million  and accounted for 369  of our total net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018  as compared to 482  for the prior year the decrease in net revenue from physical retail and other channels was due primarily to lower net revenue from mafia iii grand theft auto v and bioshock the collection  which released in september 2016 partially offset by higher net revenue from la noire due to releases on ps4 xbox one switch and htc vive  

net revenue from recurrent consumer spending on our titles through virtual currency addon content and microtransactions   increased  by 2879 million  and accounted for 416  of net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018  as compared to 258  for the prior year the increase in recurrent consumer spending was due primarily to higher virtual currency net revenue from grand theft auto online our nba 2k  franchise and social point titles with only two months of net revenue in the prior year as it was acquired in january 2017 

gross profit as a percentage of net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018  was 499  as compared to 425  in the prior year the percentage increase was due primarily to lower software development costs as a percentage of net revenue due to mafia iii and civilization vi releasing in the prior year as well as lower product costs as a percentage of net revenue due to the decrease in net revenue from physical retail sales the increase was offset by higher internal royalties as a percentage of net revenue due to the timing of when royalties are earned and to a lesser extent higher stockbased compensation costs as a percentage of net revenue 

net revenue earned outside of the united states decreased  by 400 million  and accounted for 413  of our total net revenue in the fiscal year ended march 31 2018  as compared to 439  the decrease in net revenue was due primarily to a decrease in net revenue from mafia iii partially offset by higher net revenues from our nba 2k  franchise changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased net revenue and gross profit by 98 million and 67 million respectively in the fiscal year ended march 31 2018  as compared to the prior year

selling and marketing 

selling and marketing expenses decreased  by 294 million  in the fiscal year ended march 31 2018  as compared to the prior year due primarily to 442 million in lower advertising expenses advertising expenses were lower in the current year due primarily to the releases of mafia iii and civilization vi in october 2016 and battleborn in may 2016 partially offset by higher marketing in the current year period for grand theft auto online and red dead redemption 2  the decrease was partially offset by higher personnel expenses primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense   

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses increased  by 364 million  for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018  as compared to the prior year due primarily to i increases in personnel expenses including stock and incentive compensation expense due to additional headcount including our acquisition of social point ii increases in professional fees related primarily to our management agreement with zelnickmedia as a result of the increase in our share price iii increases in it related expenses from the purchase of computer hardware and software and iv increases in rent expense due to new locations including our new corporate headquarters in new york and for social point as well as increased rent in other locations this overall increase was partially offset primarily by a 65 million  reduction of expense related to reversing a contingent consideration liability recognized in connection with the social point acquisition as we determined that the fair value of this contingent consideration was 0 based on the lower probability of social point achieving certain performance measures in the 24 month period following the acquisition 

general and administrative expenses for the fiscal years ended march 31 2018  and 2017  include occupancy expense primarily rent utilities and office expenses of  182 million and  158 million  respectively related to our development studios

business reorganization 

during the fiscal year ended march 31 2018  we announced and initiated actions to implement a strategic reorganization at one of our labels in connection with this initiative we incurred business reorganization expenses of 147 million  for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018  due primarily to employee separation costs with no corresponding costs in the prior year although we may record additional expense or benefit in future periods to trueup estimates we do not expect to incur additional reorganization costs in connection with this reorganization see note 20  business reorganization 

interest and other net 



interest and other net was income  of 10 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018  as compared to an expense  of 157 million  for the fiscal year ended march 31 2017  the increase  was due primarily to a 207 million  decrease in interest expense as a result of the settlement of our 175 convertible notes in december 2016 and higher gains on early conversions of our 100 convertible notes as well as higher interest income due to the nature of our investments and the rise of interest rates partially offset by foreign exchange transaction losses for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018  as compared to foreign exchange transaction gains in the prior year 

provisionbenefit from income taxes 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act herein referred to as the act” the act makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code that could materially affect us the act reduces the us federal corporate income tax rate from 35  to 21  effective january 1 2018 and requires companies to pay a onetime transition tax on the previously untaxed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries in addition the act makes other changes that may affect us beginning april 1 2018 these changes include but are not limited to 1 a base erosion antiabuse tax beat which is a new minimum tax 2 generally eliminating us federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries 3 a new provision that taxes global intangible lowtaxed income gilti 4 the repeal of the domestic production activity deduction and 5 other base broadening provisions 

the fasb staff qa topic 740 no 5 accounting for global intangible lowtaxed income  states that an entity can make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as gilti in future years or provide for the tax expense related to gilti in the year the tax is incurred given the complexity of the gilti provisions the company is still evaluating the effects of the gilti provisions and has not yet determined its accounting policy as of march 31 2018 the company is still evaluating the gilti provisions and analysis of future taxable income that is subject to gilti and therefore is unable to make a reasonable estimate and has not reflected any adjustments related to gilti in the consolidated financial statements 

we recorded an estimated increase to income tax expense of 181 million  related to the onetime transition tax on the previously untaxed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries as a result of the act the estimated increase was a result of a transition tax of 266 million  offset by increased benefits from domestic production deductions and tax credits in addition as a result of the decrease in the us federal corporate income tax rate from 35  to 21  we recorded a decrease to net deferred tax assets of 477 million  and a corresponding decrease to the valuation allowance of 398 million  after taking into account a portion of the deferred tax liability from indefinite lived intangibles as a source of income against deferred tax assets resulting in a tax benefit of 79 million  the remeasurement of the deferred tax liability relating to indefinite lived intangibles due to the rate change resulted in a tax benefit of 62 million  

we are currently evaluating the potential impact of the act and the amounts recorded represent provisional estimates for certain identified income tax effects for which the accounting is incomplete but a reasonable estimate can be determined in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 118 sab 118 further analysis is required to review historical practices used to calculate the untaxed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries and additional time to evaluate the complexities of the new tax law along with additional interpretative guidance that may be issued the impact of the act may differ from these estimates possibly materially due to changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made guidance that may be issued and actions we may take as a result of the act we expect to continue to analyze the act and its impact and expect to record any adjustments to provisional estimates no later than the third quarter of fiscal 2019 

our income tax benefit was 369 million  for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018  as compared to income tax expense of 97 million  for the fiscal year ended march 31 2017  

when compared to the statutory rate of 316  the effective tax rate of 270  for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018  was primarily due to 532 million  from excess tax benefits from employee stock compensation as a component of the benefit from income taxes previously excess tax benefit and tax deficiencies were recognized in additional paidincapital a benefit of 226 million  for tax credits anticipated to be utilized a benefit of 151 million  from changes in unrecognized tax benefits primarily due to expiration of statute of limitations and a benefit of 79 million  from our geographic mix of earnings partially offset by provisional amounts recorded as a result of the act and 104 million for changes in our valuation allowance 

the effective tax rate in the current year was lower compared to the prior year primarily due to 532 million  from excess tax benefits related to employee stock compensation reflected as a component of the benefit from income taxes in the current year an increased benefit from changes in unrecognized tax benefits of 173 million  primarily due to expiration of statute of limitations and 110 million  of increased tax benefits due to mix of earnings partially offset by a reduced benefit from tax credits of 127 million  and provisional amounts recorded as a result of the act 

we anticipate that additional excess tax benefits from employee stock compensation tax credits changes in valuation allowance and changes as a result of the act may arise in future periods which could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate 

the accounting for sharebased compensation will increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our sharebased compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return which depends upon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting since we recognize excess tax benefits on a discrete basis we anticipate that our effective tax rate will vary from quarter to quarter depending on our stock price in each period 

as of march 31 2018  we had gross unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties of 1285 million  of which 228 million  would affect our effective tax rate if realized for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018  gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by 83 million  

we are no longer subject to audit for us federal income tax returns for periods prior to our fiscal year ended march 31 2016 and state income tax returns for periods prior to the fiscal year ended march 31 2013 with few exceptions we are no longer subject to income tax examinations in nonus jurisdictions for years prior to fiscal year ended march 31 2012 certain us state and foreign taxing authorities are currently examining our income tax returns for the fiscal years ended march 31 2012 through march 31 2016 

we are regularly audited by domestic and foreign taxing authorities we believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable tax assessments it is possible that settlement of audits or the expiration of the statute of limitations may impact our effective tax rate in future periods 

net income and earnings per share 

for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018  our net income was 1735 million  as compared to 673 million  in the prior year   diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018  was 154  as compared to 072  for the fiscal year ended march 31 2017  basic weighted average shares outstanding of 1101 million  were 199 million  higher compared to the prior fiscal year due primarily to the settlement on conversion of our 175 convertible notes and our 100 convertible notes with shares of our common stock using the stated conversion rate and to a lesser extent the vesting of restricted stock awards see note 1  basis of presentation and significant accounting policies and note 12  earnings loss per share for additional information

depreciation and amortization expenses increased by 19 million  for the fiscal year ended march 31 2017  as compared to the prior year due primarily to higher purchases of fixed assets for information technology infrastructure and studio buildouts as well as the amortization of intangible assets related to our acquisition of social point 

interest and other net 



interest and other net was an expense of 157 million  for the fiscal year ended march 31 2017  as compared to an expense of 302 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2016 the decrease was due primarily to a 75 million decrease in interest expense as our 175 convertible note due 2016 the 175 convertible notes settled in december 2016 and to foreign exchange gains 

provision for benefit from income taxes 

income tax expense was 97 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2017 as compared to income tax benefit of 300 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2016 the increase in income tax expense was primarily attributable to a discrete tax benefit of approximately 264 million recognized in the previous year relating to a tax deduction and due to an increase in net income in the current year our effective rate differed from the federal statutory rate due primarily to changes in valuation allowances related to tax loss and tax credit carryforwards and mix of earnings our valuation allowances increased by 135 million during the fiscal year ended march 31 2017 and increased by 371 million during the fiscal year ended march 31 2016 due to changes in net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 

net income loss and earnings loss per share 

for the fiscal year ended march 31 2017 our net income was 673 million as compared to a net loss of 83 million in the prior year diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended march 31 2017 was 072 as compared basic and diluted loss per share of 010 for the fiscal year ended march 31 2016 basic weighted average shares outstanding were higher compared to the prior 

fiscal year due primarily to the issuance of 46 million shares for settlements of conversions our 100 convertible notes and our 175 convertible notes together the convertible notes and net stockbased compensation activity of 15 million shares see notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding earnings loss earnings per share 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary cash requirements have been to fund i the development manufacturing and marketing of our published products ii working capital iii acquisitions and iv capital expenditures we expect to rely on cash and cash equivalents as well as on shortterm investments funds provided by our operating activities and our credit agreement to satisfy our working capital needs 

shortterm investments 

as of march 31 2018  we had 6154 million  of shortterm investments which are highlyliquid in nature and represent an investment of cash that is available for current operations from time to time we may purchase additional shortterm investments depending on future market conditions and liquidity needs 

credit agreement 

in december 2017 we entered into a seventh amendment to our second amended and restated credit agreement as amended the “credit agreement” the credit agreement provides for borrowings of up to 1000 million  which may be increased by up to 1000 million  pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement and which is secured by substantially all of our assets and the equity of our subsidiaries the credit agreement expires on august 18 2019 revolving loans under the credit agreement bear interest at our election of a 025  to 075  above a certain base rate   475  at march 31 2018  or b 125  to 175  above the libor  rate approximately 188  at march 31 2018  with the margin rate subject to the achievement of certain average liquidity levels we are also required to pay a monthly fee on the unused available balance ranging from 025  to 0375  based on availability we had no  outstanding borrowings at march 31 2018  and 2017  

availability under the credit agreement is unrestricted when liquidity as defined in the credit agreement is at least 3000 million  when liquidity is below 3000 million  availability under the credit agreement is restricted by our united states and united kingdom based accounts receivable and inventory balances the credit agreement also allows for the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to 50 million  

as of march 31 2018  there was 983 million  available to borrow under the credit agreement and we had 17 million  of letters of credit outstanding at march 31 2018  and 2017  we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement 

the credit agreement contains covenants that substantially limit our and our subsidiaries ability to create incur assume or be liable for indebtedness dispose of assets outside the ordinary course of business acquire merge or consolidate with or into another person or entity create incur or allow any lien on any of their respective properties make investments or pay dividends or make distributions each subject to certain limitations or optionally prepay any indebtedness subject to certain exceptions including an exception permitting the redemption of the companys unsecured convertible senior notes upon the meeting of certain minimum liquidity requirements in addition the credit agreement provides for certain events of default such as nonpayment of principal and interest breaches of representations and warranties noncompliance with covenants acts of insolvency default on indebtedness held by third parties and default on certain material contracts subject to certain limitations and cure periods the credit agreement also contains a requirement that we maintain an interest coverage ratio of more than one  to one for the trailing twelve  month period if certain average liquidity levels fall below 300 million  

100 convertible notes due 2018 

on june 18 2013 we issued 2500 million  aggregate principal amount of 100  convertible notes due 2018 the 100  convertible notes were issued at 985  of par value for proceeds of 2463 million  interest on the 100  convertible notes is payable semiannually in arrears on july 1 st and january 1 st of each year commencing on january 1 2014 the 100  convertible notes mature on july 1 2018 unless earlier repurchased by the company or converted we do not have the right to redeem the 100  convertible notes prior to maturity we also granted the underwriters a 30 day option to purchase up to an additional 375 million  principal amount of 100  convertible notes to cover overallotments if any on july 17 2013 we closed our public offering of 375 million  principal amount of our 100  convertible notes as a result of the underwriters exercising their overallotment option in full on july 12 2013 bringing the total proceeds to 2832 million  

the 100  convertible notes are convertible at an initial conversion rate of 464727  shares of our common stock per 1000  principal amount of 100  convertible notes representing an initial conversion price of approximately 2152  per share of common stock for a total of approximately 134 million  underlying conversion shares subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 

during the fiscal year ended march 31 2018 100 convertible notes with an aggregate principal value of 2600 million  were submitted for conversion we elected to settle in shares of our common stock as a result of early conversions of the 100 convertible notes we recorded a gain within interest and other net on our consolidated statement of operations of 49 million  for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018 

as of april 1 2018 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date holders may convert their 100 convertible notes at any time prior to april 26 2018 upon conversion the 100 convertible notes were eligible to be settled at our election in cash shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock effective april 26 2018 we elected to settle our remaining conversion obligations in connection with the 100 convertible notes solely in shares of our common stock and accordingly notified the trustee as such we have continued to classify these 100 convertible notes as longterm debt 

financial condition 

we are subject to credit risks particularly if any of our receivables represent a limited number of customers or are concentrated in foreign markets if we are unable to collect our accounts receivable as they become due it could adversely affect our liquidity and working capital position 

generally we have been able to collect our accounts receivable in the ordinary course of business we do not hold any collateral to secure payment from customers we have trade credit insurance on the majority of our customers to mitigate accounts receivable risk 

a majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to major retailers and distributors our five largest customers accounted for 707  655  and 589  of net revenue during the fiscal years ended march 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively as of march 31 2018  and 2017  five customers accounted for 654  and 699  of our gross accounts receivable respectively customers that individually accounted for more than 10 of our gross accounts receivable balance comprised 532  and 576  of such balances at march 31 2018  and 2017  respectively we had two customers who accounted for 377  and 155  of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2018  and two customers who accounted for 402  and 174  of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2017  we did not have any additional customers that exceeded 10 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2018  and 2017  based upon performing ongoing credit evaluations maintaining trade credit insurance on a majority of our customers and our past collection experience we believe that the receivable balances from these largest customers do not represent a significant credit risk although we actively monitor each customers credit worthiness and economic conditions that may affect our customers business and access to capital we are monitoring the current global economic conditions including credit markets and other factors as it relates to our customers in order to manage the risk of uncollectible accounts receivable 

we believe our current cash short term investments and projected cash flow from operations along with availability under our credit agreement will provide us with sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash requirements for working capital capital expenditures and commitments on both a shortterm and longterm basis 

as of march 31 2018  the amount of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the us by our foreign subsidiaries was 2666 million  these balances are dispersed across various locations around the world we believe that such dispersion meets the business and liquidity needs of our foreign affiliates in addition we expect to have the ability to generate sufficient cash domestically to support ongoing operations for the foreseeable future 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act” herein referred to as the act” the act makes broad and complex changes to the us tax code which could materially affect us 

the act includes a number of provisions including international provisions which generally establish a territorialstyle system for taxing foreign income of domestic multinational corporations we are reviewing whether the act will affect our current intention to reinvest indefinitely earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and therefore have not recorded any tax liabilities associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings 

our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 142 million  shares of our common stock under this program we may purchase shares from time to time through a variety of methods including in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws repurchases are subject to the availability of stock prevailing market conditions the trading price of the stock the companys financial performance and other conditions the program does not require us to repurchase shares and may be suspended or discontinued at any time for any reason during the fiscal years ended march 31 2018  2017  and 2016  we repurchased 15 million  0  and 10 million  respectively shares of our common stock in the open market for 1548 million  00 million  and 266 million  respectively including commissions as part of the program as of march 31 2018  we had repurchased a total of 67 million  shares of our common stock under the program and 75 million  shares of our common stock remained available for repurchase under the share repurchase program 

subsequent to march 31 2018  and through the date of this filing we repurchased an additional 16 million  shares of our common stock in the open market for 1535 million  including commissions after these additional purchases 59 million  shares of our common stock remain available for repurchase under the share repurchase program 

our changes in cash flows were as follows 



at march 31 2018  we had 8090 million  of cash and cash equivalents compared to 9434 million  at march 31 2017  the decrease  in cash and cash equivalents from march 31 2017  was due primarily to cash used in financing and investing activities partially offset by cash provided by operating activities net cash used in financing activities was primarily related to repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program and tax payments related to net share settlements of our restricted stock awards net cash used in investing activities was primarily related to net purchases of available for sale securities purchases of fixed assets and other asset acquisitions net cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to cash generated from sales of virtual currency nba 2k18 grand theft auto v and wwe 2k18 partially offset by investments in software development and licenses and funding of internal royalty payments 

contractual obligations and commitments 

we have entered into various agreements in the ordinary course of business that require substantial cash commitments over the next several years generally these include 

• software development and licensing we make payments to thirdparty software developers that include contractual payments to developers under several software development agreements that expire at various times through january 2022  our aggregate outstanding software development commitments assume satisfactory performance by thirdparty software developers we also have licensing commitments that primarily consist of obligations to holders of intellectual property rights for use of their trademarks copyrights technology or other intellectual property rights in the development of our products 

• marketing we have certain minimum marketing support commitments where we commit to spend specified amounts related to marketing our products marketing commitments expire at various times through december 2022  

• operating leases our offices are occupied under noncancelable operating leases expiring at various times through december 2032  we also lease certain furniture equipment and automobiles under noncancelable leases expiring through march 2021  some of the leases have fixed rent increases and also include inducements to enter into the lease the effect of such amounts are deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the related lease term 

• purchase obligations primarily related to agreements to purchase services that are enforceable and legally binding on the company that specifies all significant terms including fixed minimum or variable pricing provisions and the approximate timing of the transactions expiring at various times through september 2021  

a summary of annual minimum contractual obligations and commitments as of march 31 2018  is as follows in thousands of dollars 



income taxes   at march 31 2018  we had recorded a liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties of 228 million  for which we are unable to make a reasonable and reliable estimate of the period in which these liabilities will be settled with the respective tax authorities therefore these liabilities have not been included in the contractual obligations table 

legal and other proceedings   we are or may become subject to demands and claims including intellectual property claims and are involved in routine litigation in the ordinary course of business which we do not believe to be material to our business or financial statements we have appropriately accrued amounts related to certain of these claims and legal and other proceedings while it is reasonably possible that a loss may be incurred in excess of the amounts accrued in our financial statements we believe that such losses unless otherwise disclosed would not be material 

on april 11 2016 we filed a declaratory judgment action in the united states district court for the southern district of new york seeking among other things a judicial declaration that leslie benzies the former president of one of our subsidiaries with whom we had been in ongoing discussions regarding his separation of employment is not entitled to any minimum allocation or financial parity with any other person under the applicable royalty plan we believe we will prevail in this matter although there can be no assurance of the outcome on april 12 2016 mr benzies filed a complaint in the supreme court of the state of new york new york county against us and certain of our subsidiaries and employees we removed this case to the united states district court for the southern district of new york but the case was subsequently remanded to state court the complaint claims damages of at least 150 million and contains allegations of breach of fiduciary duty fraudulent inducement and fraudulent concealment aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty breach of various contracts breach of implied duty of good faith and fair dealing tortious interference with contract unjust enrichment reformation constructive trust declaration of rights constructive discharge defamation and fraud we have asserted counterclaims for breach of contract theft of trade secrets and misappropriation 

as a result of amended pleadings motion practice and appeals to date twelve of mr benzies’ claims have been dismissed leaving only six remaining claims breach of various contracts constructive discharge breach of implied duty of good faith and fair dealing and tortious interference with contract our federal court action has been stayed pending the conclusion of the state court action we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the remaining claims and we intend to vigorously defend against them and to pursue our counterclaims 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of march 31 2018  and 2017  we did not have any material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial parties such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such we are not exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 

international operations 

net revenue earned outside of the united states is principally generated by our operations in europe asia australia canada and latin america for the fiscal years ended march 31 2018  2017  and 2016  413  439  and 474  respectively of our net revenue was earned outside the united states we are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade including increased credit risks tariffs and duties fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates shipping delays and international political regulatory and economic developments all of which can have a significant effect on our operating results 

fluctuations in quarterly operating results and seasonality 

we have experienced fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results as a result of the timing of the introduction of new titles variations in sales of titles developed for particular platforms market acceptance of our titles development and promotional expenses relating to the introduction of new titles sequels or enhancements of existing titles projected and actual changes in platforms the timing and success of title introductions by our competitors product returns changes in pricing policies by us and our competitors the accuracy of retailers forecasts of consumer demand the size and timing of acquisitions the timing of orders from major customers and order cancellations and delays in product shipment sales of our products are also seasonal with peak shipments typically occurring in the fourth calendar quarter as a result of increased demand for products during the holiday season for certain of our software products with multiple element revenue arrangements where we do not have vsoe for each element and the deliverables are deemed morethaninconsequential we defer the recognition of our net revenues over an estimated service period which generally ranges from 12 to 62 months as a result the quarter in which we generate the highest net sales volume may be different from the quarter in which we recognize the highest amount of net revenues quarterly comparisons of operating results are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential loss arising from fluctuations in market rates and prices our market risk exposures primarily include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates relates primarily to our shortterm investment portfolio and variable rate debt under the credit agreement 

we seek to manage our interest rate risk by maintaining a shortterm investment portfolio that includes corporate bonds with high credit quality and maturities less than two years since shortterm investments mature relatively quickly and can be reinvested at the thencurrent market rates interest income on a portfolio consisting of shortterm securities is more subject to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer term maturities however the fair value of a shortterm portfolio is less sensitive to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer term securities we do not currently use derivative financial instruments in our shortterm investment portfolio our investments are held for purposes other than trading 

as of march 31 2018  we had 6154 million  of shortterm investments which included 3987 million  of availableforsale securities the availableforsale securities were recorded at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax in stockholders equity we also had 8090 million of cash and cash equivalents that are comprised primarily of money market funds and banktime deposits we determined that based on the composition of our investment portfolio there was no material interest rate risk exposure to our consolidated financial statements or liquidity as of march 31 2018  

historically fluctuations in interest rates have not had a significant effect on our operating results under our credit agreement outstanding balances bear interest at our election of a 025  to 075  above a certain base rate  475  at march 31 2018  or b 125  to 175  above the libor rate approximately 188  at march 31 2018  with the margin rate subject to the achievement of certain average liquidity levels changes in market rates may affect our future interest expense if there is an outstanding balance on our line of credit at march 31 2018  there were no outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement the 100 convertible notes pay interest semiannually at a fixed rate of 100 per annum and we expect that there will be no fluctuation related to the 100 convertible notes affecting our cash component of interest expense for additional details on our convertible notes see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we transact business in foreign currencies and are exposed to risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates accounts relating to foreign operations are translated into united states dollars using prevailing exchange rates at the relevant period end translation adjustments are included as a separate component of stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheets for the fiscal years ended march 31 2018  and 2017  our foreign currency translation adjustment was a gain  of 434 million  and a loss  of 91 million  respectively we recognized a foreign currency exchange transaction loss  of 30 million  a gain  of 50 million  and a loss  of 14 million million for the fiscal years ended march 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively in interest and other net in our consolidated statements of operations 

balance sheet hedging activities 

we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with nonfunctional currency denominated cash balances and intercompany funding loans nonfunctional currency denominated accounts receivable and non 

functional currency denominated accounts payable these transactions are not designated as hedging instruments and are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts is reported as either assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value are reported in interest and other net in our consolidated statements of operations we do not enter into derivative financial contracts for speculative or trading purposes at march 31 2018  we had 44 million  of forward contracts outstanding to buy foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars and 676 million  of forward contracts outstanding to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars all of which have maturities of less than one year at march 31 2017  we had 92 million  of forward contracts outstanding to buy foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars and 1775 million  of forward contracts outstanding to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars all of which have maturities of less than one year for the fiscal years ended march 31 2018  2017  and 2016  we recorded a loss of 195 million  and gains of 72 million  and 01 million  respectively related to foreign currency forward contracts in interest and other net on the consolidated statements of operations as of march 31 2018  and 2017  the fair value of these outstanding forward contracts was a loss of 00 million  and 04 million  respectively and is included in accrued and other current liabilities the fair value of these outstanding forward contracts is estimated based on the prevailing exchange rates of the various hedged currencies as of the end of the period 

our hedging programs are designed to reduce but do not entirely eliminate the effect of currency exchange rate movements we believe the counterparties to these foreign currency forward contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks and that the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risks there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations for the fiscal year ended march 31 2018  413  of our revenue was generated outside the united states using sensitivity analysis a hypothetical 10 increase in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would decrease revenues by 41  while a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would increase revenues by 41  in the opinion of management a substantial portion of this fluctuation would be offset by cost of goods sold and operating expenses incurred in local currency

support label structure to target distinct market segments our business consists principally of our whollyowned labels rockstar games and 2k rockstar games is the developer and publisher of the interactive entertainment industrys most iconic and critically acclaimed brand grand theft auto  as well as other successful franchises including la noire  max payne  midnight club  and red dead  we expect rockstar games to continue to be a leader in the action  adventure product category and create groundbreaking entertainment by leveraging our existing franchises as well as developing new brands 2k publishes highquality owned and licensed titles across a range of genres including shooter action roleplaying strategy sports and familycasual 2k is the publisher of a number of critically acclaimed multimillion unit selling franchises including battleborn bioshock  borderlands  carnival games  evolve mafia  nba 2k  sid meiers civilization  wwe 2k and xcom  we expect 2k to continue to be a leader by building on its existing brands as well as by developing new franchises in the future 

focus on core strength of producing select high quality titles we focus on publishing a select number of highquality titles based on internallyowned and developed intellectual properties we currently own the intellectual property rights to 22 proprietary brands in addition we will selectively develop titles based on licensed properties including sports and also publish externally developed titles 

we use a product investment review process to evaluate potential titles for investment to review existing titles in development and to assess titles after release to measure their performance in the market and the return on our investment we apply this process to all of our products whether internally or externally developed the product investment review process includes reviews of each project at various stages of development by our executive management team and the senior management of our publishing labels and includes coordination between our sales and marketing personnel before the launch of titles this disciplined approach to product investment is expected to enhance the competitiveness and profitability of our titles 

we develop our products using a combination of our internal development teams and external development resources acting under contract with us we typically select external developers based on their track record and expertise in developing products in the same category or genre one developer will generally produce the same game for multiple platforms and will also produce sequels to the original game we believe that selecting and using development resources in this manner allows us to leverage the particular expertise of our internal and external development resources which we believe increases the quality of our products

we are dependent on a limited number of customers that account for a significant portion of our sales sales to our five largest customers during the fiscal year ended march 31 2017  accounted for 655  of our net revenue with sony and microsoft each accounting for more than 100 of our net revenue during the fiscal year ended march 31 2017  

we also distribute our titles addon content and microtransactions through direct digital download via the internet to consoles and pcs including smartphones and tablets we view digital distribution as an important growth opportunity for our industry and company however we expect that packaged goods and traditional retailers will continue to be a significant channel for the sale of our products for the foreseeable future 

marketing 

our marketing and promotional efforts are intended to maximize consumer interest in our titles promote brand name recognition of our franchises assist retailers and properly position package and merchandise our titles from time to time we also receive marketing support from hardware manufacturers in connection with their own promotional efforts 

we market titles by 

 as of march 31 2017  we had a sales and marketing staff of 415  people 

product procurement 

we procure products from suppliers principally using standard purchase orders based on our assessment of market demand we carry inventory quantities that we believe are necessary to provide rapid response to retailer orders we utilize electronic data interchange with many of our customers to enhance the efficiency of placing and shipping orders and receiving payments 

competition 

in our business we compete with 

 competition in the entertainment software industry is based on innovation features playability and product quality brand name recognition compatibility with popular platforms access to distribution channels price marketing and customer service our business is driven by hit titles which require increasing budgets for development and marketing competition for our titles is influenced by the timing of competitive product releases and the similarity of such products to our titles and may result in loss of shelf space or a reduction in sellthrough of our titles at retail stores 

trends and factors affecting our business 

product release schedule our financial results are affected by the timing of our product releases and the commercial success of those titles our grand theft auto  products in particular have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue grand theft auto  products contributed 382  of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2017  the timing of our grand theft auto  releases varies significantly which in turn may affect our financial performance on a quarterly and annual basis 

economic environment and retailer performance we continue to monitor economic conditions that may unfavorably affect our businesses such as deteriorating consumer demand pricing pressure on our products credit quality of our receivables and foreign currency exchange rates our business is dependent upon a limited number of customers who account for a significant portion of our revenue our five largest customers accounted for 655  589  and 646  of net revenue during the fiscal years ended march 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively as of march 31 2017  and 2016 five customers comprised 699  and 739   

of our gross accounts receivable respectively with our significant customers those that individually comprised more than 10 of our gross accounts receivable balance accounting for 576  and 641  of such balance at march 31 2017  and 2016  respectively we had two customers who accounted for 402  and 174  of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2017  and three customers who accounted for 352  168  and 121  of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2016 we did not have any additional customers that exceeded 10 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2017  and 2016 the economic environment has affected our customers in the past and may do so in the future bankruptcies or consolidations of our large retail customers could seriously hurt our business due to uncollectible accounts receivables and the concentration of purchasing power among the remaining large retailers certain of our large customers sell used copies of our games which may negatively affect our business by reducing demand for new copies of our games while the downloadable content that we now offer for certain of our titles may serve to reduce used game sales we expect used game sales to continue to adversely affect our business 

hardware platforms we derive most of our revenue from the sale of products made for video game platforms manufactured by thirdparties such as sonys ps4c and ps3 and microsofts xbox one and xbox 360 which comprised 810  of our net revenue by product platform for the fiscal year ended march 31 2017  the success of our business is dependent upon the consumer acceptance of these platforms and the continued growth in the installed base of these platforms when new hardware platforms are introduced demand for software based on older platforms typically declines which may negatively affect our business during the market transition to the new consoles accordingly our strategy is to focus our development efforts on a select number of the highest quality titles for these platforms while also expanding our offerings for emerging platforms such as tablets smartphones and online games 

online content and digital distribution the interactive entertainment software industry is delivering a growing amount of content through digital online delivery methods we provide a variety of online delivered products and offerings virtually all of our titles that are available through retailers as packaged goods products are also available through direct digital download via the internet from websites we own and others owned by thirdparties in addition we aim to drive ongoing engagement and recurrent consumer spending on our titles after their initial purchase by generating incremental revenues through downloadable offerings including virtual currency addon content and microtransactions we also publish an expanding variety of titles for tablets and smartphones which are delivered to consumers through digital download via the internet note 17 to the consolidated financial statements segment and geographic information discloses that net revenue from digital online channels comprised 518  of our net revenue by distribution channel for the fiscal year ended march 31 2017  we expect online delivery of games and game offerings to become an increasing part of our business over the longterm 

international operations 

international sales are a significant part of our business for the fiscal years ended march 31 2017 2016 and 2015 439  474 and 425 respectively of our net revenue was earned outside the united states we are continuing to execute on our growth initiatives in asia where our strategy is to broaden the distribution of our existing products and expand our online gaming presence especially in china and south korea we are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade including increased credit risks tariffs and duties fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates shipping delays and international political regulatory and economic developments all of which can have a significant effect on our operating results see notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

segment and geographic information 

see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

employees 

as of march 31 2017  we had 3707  fulltime employees of which 1772  were employed outside of the united states none of our regular employees is subject to collective bargaining agreements we consider our relations with employees to be satisfactory 




 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties which may affect our future financial performance because of the risks and uncertainties described below as well as other factors affecting our operating results and financial condition past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and our business and financial performance could be harmed and the market value of our securities could decline 

risks relating to our business 

we are dependent on the future success of our grand theft auto products and we must continue to publish hit titles or sequels to such hit titles in order to compete successfully in our industry 

grand theft auto  and certain of our other titles are hit products and have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue grand theft auto  products contributed 382  of the companys net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2017  and the five bestselling franchises including grand theft auto  which may change year over year in the aggregate accounted for 898  of the companys net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2017  if we fail to continue to develop and sell new commercially successful hit titles or sequels to such hit titles or experience any delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of our hit titles or their sequels our revenue and profits may decrease substantially and we may incur losses in addition competition in our industry is intense and a relatively small number of hit titles account for a large portion of total revenue in our industry hit products offered by our competitors may take a larger share of consumer spending than we anticipate which could cause revenue generated from our products to fall below our expectations if our competitors develop more successful products or services at lower price points or based on payment models perceived as offering better value or if we do not continue to develop consistently high quality and wellreceived products and services our revenue and profitability may decline in addition both the online and mobile games marketplaces are characterized by frequent product introductions relatively low barriers to entry and new and evolving business methods technologies and platforms for development widespread consumer adoption of these new platforms for games and other technological advances in online or mobile game offerings could negatively affect our sales of console and traditional pc products before we have an opportunity to develop profitable businesses in such markets 

we are subject to product development risks which could result in delays and additional costs and we must adapt to changes in software technologies 

we depend on our internal development studios and thirdparty software developers to develop new interactive entertainment software within anticipated release schedules and cost projections the development cycle for new titles generally ranges from 12 months for annual sports releases to multiple years for certain of our topselling titles therefore our development costs can be substantial if we or our third party developers experience unanticipated development delays financial difficulties or additional costs we may not be able to release titles according to our schedule and at budgeted costs there can be no assurance that our products will be sufficiently successful so that we can recoup these costs or make a profit on these products 

additionally in order to stay competitive our internal development studios must anticipate and adapt to rapid technological changes affecting software development any inability to respond to technological advances and implement new technologies could render our products obsolete or less marketable further the failure to pursue the development of new technology platforms or business models that obtain meaningful commercial success in a timely manner may negatively affect our business resulting in increased production costs and more strenuous competition   

the inability of our products to achieve significant market acceptance delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of our products may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

new products may not achieve significant market acceptance generate sufficient sales or be introduced in a timely manner to permit us to recover development manufacturing and marketing costs associated with these products the life cycle of a title generally involves a relatively high level of sales during the first few months after introduction followed by a rapid decline in sales because sales associated with an initial product launch generally constitute a high percentage of the total sales associated with the life of a product delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of one or more new products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results and cause our operating results to be materially different from our expectations 

our business is subject to our ability to develop commercially successful products for the current video game platforms 

we derive most of our revenue from the sale of products made for video game platforms manufactured by third parties such as sonys ps4 and ps3 and microsofts xbox one and xbox 360 which comprised 810  of the companys net revenue by product platform for the fiscal year ended march 31 2017  the success of our business is subject to the continued popularity of these platforms and our ability to develop commercially successful products for these platforms 

connectivity issues could affect our ability to sell and provide online services for our products and could affect our profitability 

we rely upon thirdparty digital delivery platforms such as microsofts xbox live sony entertainment network steam and other thirdparty service providers to provide connectivity from the consumer to our digital products and our online services connectivity issues could prevent customers from accessing this content and our ability to successfully market and sell our products could be adversely affected in addition we could experience similar issues related to services we host on our internal servers such issues also could affect our ability to provide online services and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

our business could be adversely affected if our consumer data protection measures are not seen as adequate or there are breaches of our security measures or unintended disclosures of our consumer data 

we are collecting and storing consumer information including personal information we take measures to protect our consumer data from unauthorized access or disclosure it is possible that our security controls over consumer data may not prevent the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information in addition due to the high profile nature of our products we may draw a disproportionately higher amount of attention and attempts to breach our security controls than companies with lower profile products a security breach that leads to disclosure of consumer account information including personally identifiable information could harm our reputation compel us to comply with disparate breach notification laws in various jurisdictions and otherwise subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue a resulting perception that our products or services do not adequately protect the privacy of personal information could result in a loss of current or potential consumers and business partners in addition if any of our business partners experience a security breach that leads to disclosure of consumer account information our reputation could be harmed resulting in loss of revenue 

in addition certain of our products are online enabled the ability of our products to offer online functionality and our ability to offer content through a video game platforms digital distribution channel is dependent upon the continued operation and security of such platforms online network these third party networks as well as our own internal systems and websites and the security measures related thereto may be breached as a result of thirdparty action including intentional misconduct by computer hackers employee error malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers data or our data including our intellectual property and other confidential business information or our information technology systems because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs we may lose business suffer irreparable damage to our reputation andor incur significant costs and expenses relating to the investigation and possible litigation of claims relating to such event 

the laws and regulations concerning data privacy and certain other aspects of our business are continually evolving failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business 

we are subject to certain privacy and data protection laws including those in the united states certain activities related to eu customers are registered with our uk data controller the us childrens online privacy protection act also regulates the collection use and disclosure of personal information from children under 13 years of age failure to comply with privacy laws data protection laws or age restrictions may increase our costs subject us to expensive and distracting government investigations and result in substantial fines 

privacy and data protection laws are rapidly changing and likely will continue to do so for the foreseeable future which could have an impact on our approach to operating and marketing our games for example the court of justice of the european unions recent decision to invalidate the euus safe harbor regime that legitimized the transfer of certain personal data from the eu to the us was a material change to laws on data privacy applicable to our business in addition after four years of preparation and debate the eu parliament approved the general data protection regulation gdpr on april 14 2016 gdpr will become effective in may 2018 and will replace the existing data protection directive 9546ec the us government including the federal trade commission and the department of commerce also continue to review the need for greater or different regulation over the collection of personal information and information about consumer behavior on the internet and on mobile devicesvarious government and consumer agencies worldwide have also called for new regulation and changes in industry practices 

player use of our games is subject to our privacy policy end user license agreements and terms of service if we fail to comply with our posted privacy policy eulas or terms of service or if we fail to comply with existing privacyrelated or data protection laws and regulations it could result in proceedings or litigation against us by governmental authorities or others which could result in fines or judgments against us damage our reputation affect our financial condition and harm our business if regulators the media or consumers raise any concerns about our privacy and data protection or consumer protection practices even if unfounded this could also result in fines or judgments against us damage our reputation negatively affect our financial condition and damage our business 

it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted or construed to apply to us in the united states and elsewhere that could restrict the interactive entertainment industry including player privacy advertising taxation content suitability copyright distribution and antitrust furthermore the growth and development of electronic commerce and virtual goods may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on companies such as ours conducting business through digital sales any such changes would require us to devote legal and other resources to address such regulation for example existing laws or new laws regarding the regulation of currency banking institutions and unclaimed property may be interpreted to cover virtual currency or virtual goods if that were to occur we may be required to seek licenses authorizations or approvals from relevant regulators the granting of which may be dependent on us meeting certain capital and other requirements and we may be subject to additional regulation and oversight all of which could significantly increase our operating costs changes 

in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the united states or elsewhere regarding these activities may lessen the growth of the interactive entertainment industry and impair our business financial condition and operating results 

security breaches involving the source code for our products or other sensitive and proprietary information could adversely affect our business 

we securely store the source code for our interactive entertainment software products as it is created a breach whether physical electronic or otherwise of the systems on which such source code and other sensitive data are stored could lead to damage or piracy of our software in addition certain parties with whom we do business are given access to our sensitive and proprietary information in order to provide services and support our team these third parties may misappropriate our information and engage in unauthorized use of it if we are subject to data security breaches we may have a loss in sales or increased costs arising from the restoration or implementation of additional security measures which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results any theft andor unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an event could adversely affect our competitive position reputation brand and future sales of our products our business could be subject to significant disruption and we could suffer monetary and other losses and reputational harm in the event of such incidents and claims 

we rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business any significant system or network disruption could have a negative impact on our business 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks some of which are within taketwo and some of which are managed andor hosted by thirdparty providers all information technology systems and networks are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources including but not limited to cyberattacks malicious software security breach energy blackouts natural disasters terrorism war and telecommunication failures we may also face sophisticated attacks referred to as advanced persistent threats which are cyberattacks aimed at compromising our intellectual property and other commerciallysensitive information such as the source code and game assets for our software or confidential customer or employee information which remain undetected for prolonged periods of time information technology system or network failure or security breach could negatively affect our business continuity operations and financial results these risks extend to the networks and ecommerce sites of console platform providers and other partners who sell and host our content online we may incur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions or security breaches 

our efforts to expand into new products and services may subject us to additional risks 

in recent years we have invested in emerging opportunities in interactive entertainment played on mobile platforms including tablets and smartphones and online platforms including social networks we have also grown our product offerings that are available through digital download including virtual currency through our existing franchises such as grant theft auto  and nba 2k  as well as through product offerings by newly acquired social point and other mobile product offerings we are actively investing to capitalize on these trends in order to diversify our product mix reduce our operating risks and increase our revenue there are risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed there is no assurance that we will be able to attract a sufficiently large number of customers or recover costs incurred for developing and marketing any of these new products or services for example we may offer games that do not attract sufficient purchases of virtual currency which may cause our investments into this product space such as through our recent acquisition of social point to fail to realize the expected benefits external factors such as competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also have an impact on the successful implementation of any new products or services failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we depend on our key management and product development personnel 

our continued success will depend to a significant extent on our senior management team and our relationship with zelnickmedia corporation zelnickmedia our executive chairmanchief executive officer and president are partners of zelnickmedia we are also highly dependent on the expertise skills and knowledge of certain of our rockstar employees and other key creative personnel responsible for content creation and development of our grand theft auto  titles and titles based on other brands we may not be able to continue to retain these personnel at current compensation levels or at all 

the loss of the services of our executive officers zelnickmedia our key rockstar employees or other key creative personnel could significantly harm our business in addition if one or more key employees were to join a competitor or form a competing company we may lose additional personnel experience material interruptions in product development delays in bringing products to market and difficulties in our relationships with licensors suppliers and customers which would significantly harm our business failure to continue to attract and retain other qualified management and creative personnel could adversely affect our business and prospects 

declines in consumer spending and other adverse changes in the economy could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

most of our products involve discretionary spending on the part of consumers we believe that consumer spending is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income this makes our products particularly sensitive to general economic conditions and economic cycles as consumers are generally more willing to make discretionary purchases including purchases of products like ours during periods in which favorable economic conditions prevail adverse economic conditions such as a prolonged us or international general economic downturn including periods of increased inflation unemployment levels tax rates interest rates energy prices or declining consumer confidence could also reduce consumer spending reduced consumer spending has and may in the future continue to result in reduced demand for our products and may also require increased selling and promotional expenses which has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results in addition during periods of relative economic weakness our consolidated credit risk reflecting our counterparty dealings with distributors customers capital providers and others may increase perhaps materially so furthermore uncertainty and adverse changes in the economy could also increase the risk of material losses on our investments increase costs associated with developing and publishing our products increase the cost and availability of sources of financing and increase our exposure to material losses from bad debts any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results if economic conditions worsen our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 

changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and in various other jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are required to estimate future taxes although we currently believe our tax estimates are reasonable the estimate process is inherently uncertain and such estimates are not binding on tax authorities further our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by a variety of factors including changes in the business including the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in tax elections and changes in applicable tax laws additionally tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities and developments in those audits could adversely affect our income tax provision should the ultimate tax liability exceed estimates our income tax provision and net income or loss could be adversely affected 

historically we recorded a valuation allowance against most of our us deferred tax assets we expect to provide a valuation allowance on future us tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability or until other significant positive evidence arises that suggest that these benefits are more likely than not to be realized further our tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities and developments in those audits could adversely affect our income tax provision should our ultimate tax liability exceed our estimates our income tax provision and net income or loss could be materially affected 

we earn a significant amount of our operating income and hold a significant portion of our cash outside the us any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions may result in higher effective tax rates for the company in addition there have been proposals to change us tax laws that would significantly affect how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings although we cannot predict whether or in what form this proposed legislation will pass if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our income tax provision and financial condition 

we are also required to pay taxes other than income taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the us and foreign jurisdictions we are regularly under examination by tax authorities with respect to these nonincome taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations changes in our business or changes in applicable tax rules will not have an adverse effect on our net income or loss and financial condition 

unclaimed property audits by governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results 

we are subject to unclaimed property escheat laws which require us to turn over to certain government authorities the property of others held by us that has been unclaimed for a specified period of time we are subject to audit by individual us states with regard to our escheatment practices the legislation and regulations related to unclaimed property matters tend to be complex and subject to varying interpretations by both government authorities and taxpayers although management believes that the positions we have taken are reasonable various taxing authorities may challenge certain of the positions we have taken which may also potentially result in additional liabilities for unclaimed property and interest in excess of accrued liabilities our positions are reviewed as events occur such as the availability of new information the lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations the measurement of additional estimated liability based on current calculations or the rendering of relevant court decisions an unfavorable resolution of assessments by a governmental authority could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future periods 

our quarterly operating results are dependent on the release of hit titles and are highly seasonal which may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate significantly 

we have experienced and may continue to experience wide fluctuations in quarterly operating results the release of a hit title typically leads to a high level of sales during the first few months after introduction followed by a rapid decline in sales in addition the interactive entertainment industry is highly seasonal with sales typically higher during the fourth calendar quarter due primarily to increased demand for games during the holiday season demand for and sales of titles in our nba 2k  series are also seasonal in that they are typically released just prior to the start of the nba season if a key event or sports season to which our product release schedule is tied were to be delayed or cancelled our sales might also suffer disproportionately our failure or inability to produce hit titles or introduce products on a timely basis to meet seasonal fluctuations in demand could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results the uncertainties associated with software development manufacturing lead times production delays and the approval process for products by hardware manufacturers and other licensors make it difficult to predict the quarter in which our products will ship and therefore may cause us to fail to meet financial expectations 

price protection granted to our customers and returns of our published titles by our customers may adversely affect our operating results 

we are exposed to the risk of price protection and product returns with respect to our customers our distribution arrangements with customers generally do not give them the right to return titles to us or to cancel firm orders however we sometimes accept product returns from our distribution customers for stock balancing and negotiate accommodations for customers which include credits and returns when demand for specific products falls below expectations we grant price protection and accept returns in connection with our publishing arrangements and revenue is recognized after deducting estimated price protection and reserves for returns while we believe that we can reliably estimate future price protection and returns if price protection and return rates for our products exceed our reserves our revenue could decline which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

increased sales of used video game products could lower our sales 

certain of our larger customers sell used video games which are generally priced lower than new video games if our customers increase their sales of used video games it could negatively affect our sales of new video games and have an adverse influence on our business financial condition and operating results 

a limited number of customers account for a significant portion of our sales the loss of a principal customer or other significant business relationship could seriously hurt our business 

a substantial portion of our product sales are made to a limited number of customers sales to our five largest customers during the fiscal year ended march 31 2017  accounted for 655  of our net revenue with sony and microsoft each accounting for more than 100 of our net revenue during the fiscal year ended march 31 2017  our sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders without longterm agreements or other commitments and our customers may terminate their relationship with us at any time certain of our customers may decline to carry products containing mature content the loss of our relationships with principal customers or a decline in sales to principal customers including as a result of a product being rated ao age 18 and over could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results in addition if our customers are subject to pricing pressures due to deteriorating demand for our products competitive pressure or otherwise such customers may pass those pricing pressures through to us which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

furthermore our customers may also be placed into bankruptcy become insolvent or be liquidated due to economic downturns global contractions of credit or for other factors bankruptcies or consolidations of certain large retail customers could seriously hurt our business including as a result of uncollectible accounts receivable from such customers and the concentration of purchasing power among remaining large retailers in addition our results of operations may be adversely affected if certain of our customers who purchase on credit terms are no longer eligible to purchase on such terms due to their financial distress which may reduce the quantity of products they demand from us 

if our marketing and advertising efforts fail to resonate with consumers our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 

our products are marketed worldwide through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs such as television and online advertising social media advertising print advertising retail merchandising website development and event sponsorship our ability to sell our products and services is dependent in part on the success of these programs if the marketing for our products and services fails to resonate with consumers particularly during the holiday season or other key selling periods or if advertising rates or other media placement costs increase these factors could have a material adverse influence on our business financial condition and operating results 

the interactive entertainment software industry is highly competitive 

we compete for both licenses to properties and the sale of interactive entertainment software with sony and microsoft each of which is a large developer and marketer of software for its own platforms we also compete with game publishers such as activision blizzard inc and electronic arts inc and ubisoft entertainment sa as our business is dependent upon our ability to develop hit titles which require increasing budgets for development and marketing the availability of significant financial resources has become a major competitive factor in developing and marketing software games some of our competitors have greater financial technical personnel and other resources than we do and are able to finance larger budgets for development and marketing and make higher offers to licensors and developers for commercially desirable properties our titles also compete with other forms of entertainment such as social media and casual games in addition to motion pictures television and audio and video products featuring similar themes online computer programs and other entertainment which may be less expensive or provide other advantages to consumers 

a number of software publishers who compete with us have developed and commercialized or are currently developing online games for use by consumers over the internet if technological advances significantly increase the availability of online games and if consumer acceptance of online gaming grows substantially it could result in a decline in our platformbased software sales and negatively affect sales of such products 

increased competition for limited shelf space and promotional support from retailers could affect the success of our business and require us to incur greater expenses to market our titles 

retailers have limited shelf space and promotional resources and competition is intense among newly introduced interactive entertainment software titles for adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support competition for retail shelf space is expected to continue to increase which may require us to increase our marketing expenditures to maintain desirable sales levels of our titles competitors with more extensive lines and more popular titles may have greater bargaining power with retailers accordingly we may not be able or we may have to pay more than our competitors to achieve similar levels of promotional support and shelf space 

our business is partly dependent on our ability to enter into successful software development arrangements with thirdparties 

our success depends on our ability to continually identify and develop new titles on a timely basis we rely on thirdparty software developers for the development of some of our titles quality thirdparty developers are continually in high demand software developers who have developed titles for us in the past may not be available to develop software for us in the future due to the limited number of thirdparty software developers and the limited control that we exercise over them these developers may not be able to complete titles for us on a timely basis or within acceptable quality standards if at all we have entered into agreements with thirdparties to acquire the rights to publish and distribute interactive entertainment software as well as to use licensed intellectual properties in our titles these agreements typically require us to make development payments pay royalties and satisfy other conditions our development payments may not be sufficient to permit developers to develop new software successfully which could result in material delays and significantly increase our costs to bring particular products to market software development costs promotion and marketing expenses and royalties payable to software developers and thirdparty licensors have increased significantly in recent years and reduce potential profits derived from sales of our software future sales of our titles may not be sufficient to recover development payments and advances to software developers and licensors and we may not have adequate financial and other resources to satisfy our contractual commitments to such developers if we fail to satisfy our obligations under agreements with thirdparty developers and licensors the agreements may be terminated or modified in ways that are burdensome to us and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we cannot publish our titles without the approval of hardware licensors that are also our competitors 

we are required to obtain licenses from sony and microsoft which are also our competitors to develop and publish titles for their respective hardware platforms our existing platform licenses require that we obtain approval for the publication of new titles on a titlebytitle basis as a result the number of titles we are able to publish for these hardware platforms our ability to manage the timing of the release of these titles and accordingly our net revenue from titles for these hardware platforms may be limited if a licensor chooses not to renew or extend our license agreement at the end of its current term or if a licensor were to terminate our license for any reason or does not approve one or more of our titles we may be unable to publish that title as well as additional titles for that licensors platform termination of any such agreements or disapproval of titles could seriously hurt our business and prospects we may be unable to continue to enter into license agreements for certain current generation platforms on satisfactory terms or at all failure to enter into any such agreement could also seriously hurt our business 

we rely on a limited number of channel partners some of whom influence the fee structures for online distribution of our games on their platforms 

we rely on a limited number of channel partners some of whom have retained the right to change the fee structures for online distribution of both paid content and free content including patches and corrections that we license to them for distribution on their platforms such channel partners ability to set or influence royalty rates may increase costs which could negatively affect our operating margins we may be unable to distribute our content in a costeffective or profitable manner through such distribution channel which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

outside of fee arrangements our agreements with our channel partners sometimes give them significant control over other aspects of the distribution of our products and services that we develop for their platform if our channel partners establish terms that restrict our offerings through their channels or significantly affect the financial terms on which these products or services are offered to our customers we may be unable to distribute our product offerings through them or be forced to do so on a materially worse financial or business terms 

we may not be able to adequately adjust our cost structure in a timely fashion in response to a sudden decrease in demand 

in the event of a significant decline in revenue we may not be able to dispose of facilities reduce personnel or make other changes to our cost structure without disruption to our operations or without significant termination and exit costs management may not be able to implement such actions in a timely manner if at all to offset an immediate shortfall in revenue and profit moreover reducing costs may impair our ability to produce and develop software titles at sufficient levels in the future 

the increasing importance of digital sales to our business exposes us to the risks of that business model including greater competition 

the proportion of our revenues derived from digital content delivery as compared to traditional retail sales may continue to increase the increased importance of digital content delivery in our industry increases our potential competition as the minimum capital needed to produce and publish a digitally delivered game is significantly less than that needed to produce and publish one that is purchased through retail distribution and is played on a game console this will also require us to dedicate capital to developing and implementing alternative marketing strategies which we may not do successfully if either occurs we may be unable to effectively market and distribute our products which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results in addition a continuing shift to digital delivery could result in a deprioritization of our products by traditional retailers the increasing importance of digital sales to our business could also result in increasing issues with our digital distribution process including difficulties our distributors have with collecting from consumers and any associated rebates we would owe 

we use open source software in connection with certain of our games and services which may pose particular risks to our proprietary software products and services in a manner that could have a negative impact on our business 

we use open source software in connection with certain of our games and the services we offer some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software or make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost the terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by courts and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our use of the open source software were it determined that our use was not in compliance with a particular license we may be required to release our proprietary source code pay damages for breach of contract reengineer our games discontinue distribution in the event reengineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our game development efforts any of which could harm our business 

we depend on servers and internet bandwidth to operate our games and digital services with online features if we were to lose server capacity or lack sufficient internet bandwidth for any reason our business could suffer 

we rely on data servers including those owned or controlled by third parties to enable our customers to download our games and other downloadable content and to operate our online games and other products with online functionality events such as limited hardware failure any broadbased catastrophic server malfunction a significant intrusion by hackers that circumvents security measures or a failure of disaster recovery services would likely interrupt the functionality of our games with online services and could result in a loss of sales for games and related services an extended interruption of service could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we expect a significant portion of our games to be online enabled in the future and therefore we must project our future server needs and make advance purchases of servers or server capacity to accommodate expected business demands if we underestimate the amount of server capacity our business requires or if our business were to grow more quickly than expected our consumers may experience service problems such as slow or interrupted gaming access insufficient server capacity may result in decreased sales a loss of our consumer base and adverse consequences to our reputation conversely if we overestimate the amount of server capacity required by our business we may incur additional operating costs 

because of the potential importance of our online business to our revenues and results of operations our ability to access adequate internet bandwidth and online computational resources to support our business is critical if the price of either such resource increases we may not be able to increase our prices or subscriber levels to compensate for such costs which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we submit our products for rating by the entertainment software rating board esrb in the united states and other voluntary or government ratings organizations in foreign countries failure to obtain a target rating for certain of our products could negatively affect our ability to distribute and sell those games as could the rerating of a game for any reason 

we voluntarily submit our game products to the esrb a usbased nonprofit and independent ratings organization the esrb system provides consumers with information about game content using a rating symbol that generally suggests the appropriate player age group and specific content descriptors such as graphic violence profanity or sexually explicit material the esrb may impose significant penalties on game publishers for violations of its rules related to rating or marketing games including revocation of a rating or monetary fines other countries require voluntary or government backed ratings as prerequisites for product sales in some instances we may have to modify our products in order to market them under the target rating which could delay or disrupt the release of our products in addition some of our titles may not be sold at all or without extensive edits in certain countries such as germany 

in the united states if the esrb rates a game as ao age 18 and older platform licensors may not certify the game and retailers may refuse to sell it in addition some consumers have reacted to reratings or controversial game content by refusing to purchase such games demanding refunds for games that they had already purchased and refraining from buying other games published by us many of our rockstar titles and certain of our 2k titles have been rated m age 17 and older by the esrb if we are unable to obtain m ratings and instead receive ao ratings on future versions of those or similar titles as a result of changes in the esrbs ratings standards or for other reasons including the adoption of legislation in this area our business and prospects could be negatively affected if any of our games are rerated by the esrb or other foreign based ratings organizations we could be exposed to litigation administrative fines and penalties and other potential liabilities and our operating results and financial condition could be significantly affected 

we have implemented processes to comply with the requirements of the esrb and other ratings organizations and properly display the designated rating symbols and content descriptions nonetheless these processes are subject to human error circumvention overriding and reasonable resource constraints if a video game we published were found to contain undisclosed pertinent content the esrb could rerate a game retailers could refuse to sell it and demand that we accept the return of any unsold copies or returns from customers and consumers could refuse to buy it or demand that we refund their money this could have a material negative affect on our operating results and financial condition in addition we may be exposed to litigation administrative fines and penalties and our reputation could be harmed which could affect sales of other video games we sell if any of these consequences were to occur our business and financial performance could be significantly harmed 

content policies adopted by retailers consumer opposition and litigation could negatively affect sales of our products 

retailers may decline to sell interactive entertainment software containing what they judge to be graphic violence or sexually explicit material or other content that they deem inappropriate for their businesses if retailers decline to sell our products based upon their opinion that they contain objectionable themes graphic violence or sexually explicit material or other generally objectionable content or if any of our previously m rated series products are rated ao we might be required to significantly change or discontinue particular titles or series which in the case of our bestselling grand theft auto  titles could seriously affect our business consumer advocacy groups have opposed sales of interactive entertainment software containing objectionable themes violence or sexual material or other objectionable content by pressing for legislation in these areas and by engaging in public demonstrations and media campaigns additionally although lawsuits seeking damages for injuries allegedly suffered by thirdparties as a result of video games have generally been unsuccessful in the courts claims of this kind have been asserted against us from time to time and may be asserted and be successful in the future an increase in the number of lawsuits filed by the families of victims of violence may trigger supplemental governmental scrutiny damage our reputation and negatively affect the sale of our products 

our results of operations or reputation may be harmed as a result of offensive consumercreated content 

we are subject to risks associated with the collaborative online features in our games which allow consumers to post narrative comments in real time that are visible to other consumers from time to time objectionable and offensive consumer content may be posted to a gaming or other site with online chat features or game forums which allow consumers to post comments we may be subject to lawsuits governmental regulation or restrictions and consumer backlash including decreased sales and harmed reputation as a result of consumers posting offensive content we may also be subject to consumer backlash from comments made in response to postings we make on social media sites such as facebook youtube and twitter 

we are subject to risks and uncertainties of international trade including fluctuations in the values of local foreign currencies against the dollar 

sales in international markets primarily in europe have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2017  439  of our net revenue was earned outside the united states we are continuing to execute on our growth initiatives in asia where our strategy is to broaden the distribution of our existing products and expand our online gaming presence especially in china and south korea we are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade including increased credit risks tariffs and duties fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates shipping delays and international political regulatory and economic developments all of which can have a significant influence on our operating results many of our international sales are made in local currencies which could fluctuate against the dollar while we may use forward exchange contracts to a limited extent to seek to mitigate foreign currency risk our operating results could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations 

we face risks from our international operations 

we are subject to certain risks because of our international operations particularly as we continue to grow our business and presence in asia latin america and other parts of the world changes to and compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations may increase our cost of doing business and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals could harm our international and domestic sales trade legislation in either the united states or other countries such as a change in the current tariff structures importexport compliance laws or other trade laws or policies could adversely affect our ability to sell or to distribute in international markets we incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our international operations and could become subject to legal penalties in foreign countries if we do not comply with local laws and regulations which may be substantially different from those in the united states in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it may be common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by united states laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and by local laws such as laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations including those based in or from countries where practices which violate such laws may be customary will not take actions in violation of our policies any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could have a material adverse effect on our business 

on june 23 2016 the uk held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” on march 29 2017 the uk notified the european council in accordance with article 50 of the treaty on european union of the uk’s intention to withdraw from the european union as a result it is expected that the british government will begin negotiating the terms of the uk’s future relationship with the eu the effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the uk makes to retain access to the eu markets either during a transitional period or more permanently the measures could potentially disrupt the markets we serve and may cause us to lose customers distributors and employees if the uk loses access to the single eu market and the global trade deals negotiated by the eu it could have a detrimental impact on our uk growth such a decline could also make our doing business in europe more difficult which could negatively affect sales to consumers of our products without access to the single eu market it may be more challenging and costly to distribute our products in europe in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replace and replicate if there are changes to uk immigration policy as a result of brexit this could affect our employees and their ability to move freely between the eu member states for work related matters 

if we are unable to protect the intellectual property relating to our software the commercial value of our products will be adversely affected and our competitive position could be harmed 

we develop proprietary software and have obtained the rights to publish and distribute software developed by thirdparties we attempt to protect our software and production techniques under patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as through contractual restrictions on disclosure copying and distribution nonetheless our software is susceptible to piracy and unauthorized copying and thirdparties may potentially exploit or misappropriate our intellectual property and proprietary information causing significant reputational damage unauthorized thirdparties for example may be able to copy or to reverse engineer our software to obtain and use programming or production techniques that we regard as proprietary well organized piracy operations have also proliferated in recent years resulting in the ability to download pirated copies of our software over the internet although we attempt to incorporate protective measures into our software piracy of our products could negatively affect our future profitability 

if we infringe on or are alleged to infringe on the intellectual property rights of thirdparties our business could be adversely affected 

as our industry grows we may be subject to an increasing amount of litigation that is common in the software industry based on allegations of infringement or other alleged violations of patent copyright andor trademarks in addition we believe that interactive entertainment software will increasingly become the subject of claims that such software infringes on the intellectual property 

rights of others with both the growth of online functionality and advances in technology game content and software graphics as games become more realistic from time to time we receive notices from thirdparties or are named in lawsuits by thirdparties alleging infringement of their proprietary rights although we believe that our software and technologies and the software and technologies of thirdparty developers and publishers with whom we have contractual relations do not and will not infringe or violate proprietary rights of others it is possible that infringement of proprietary rights of others may occur any claims of infringement with or without merit could be time consuming costly and difficult to defend moreover intellectual property litigation or claims could require us to discontinue the distribution of products obtain a license or redesign our products which could result in additional substantial costs and material delays 

our software is susceptible to errors which can harm our financial results and reputation 

the technological advancements of new hardware platforms result in the development of more complex software products as software products become more complex the risk of undetected errors in new products increases we may need to produce and distribute patches in order to repair such errors which could be costly and may distract our developers from working on new products if despite testing errors are found in new products or releases after shipments have been made we may have to consider suspending distribution of defective products or offering refunds and we could experience a loss of or delay in timely market acceptance product returns loss of revenue increases in costs relating to the repair of such errors and damage to our reputation 

if we acquire or invest in other businesses intellectual properties or other assets we may be unable to integrate them with our business our financial performance may be impaired andor we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for such transactions 

if appropriate opportunities present themselves we may acquire or make investments in businesses intellectual properties and other assets that we believe are strategic we may not be able to identify negotiate or finance any future acquisition or investment successfully even if we do succeed in acquiring or investing in a business intellectual property or other asset such acquisitions and investments involve a number of risks including 

 future acquisitions and investments could also involve the issuance of our equity and equitylinked securities potentially diluting our existing stockholders the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses writeoffs of goodwill intangibles 

or acquired inprocess technology or other increased cash and noncash expenses such as stockbased compensation any of the foregoing factors could harm our financial condition or prevent us from achieving improvements in our financial condition and operating performance that could have otherwise been achieved by us on a standalone basis our stockholders may not have the opportunity to review vote on or evaluate future acquisitions or investments 

our ability to acquire and maintain licenses to intellectual property especially for sports titles affects our revenue and profitability competition for these licenses may make them more expensive and increase our costs 

certain of our products are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others for example certain of our 2k products include rights licensed from major sports leagues and players associations similarly some of our other titles are based on licenses of popular entertainment products competition for these licenses is intense if we are unable to maintain these licenses or obtain additional licenses on reasonable economic terms or with significant commercial value our revenue and profitability could decline significantly competition for these licenses may also increase the advances guarantees and royalties that we must pay to the licensor which could significantly increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability in addition on certain intellectual property licenses we are subject to guaranteed minimum payments royalties or standards of performance and may not be able to terminate these agreements prior to their stated expiration if such licensed products do not generate revenues in excess of such minimum guarantees our profitability will be adversely affected 

we are subject to contractual covenants which place certain limitations on how we manage our business  

our second amended and restated credit agreement as amended the credit agreement and the indentures governing our 100 convertible notes due 2018 issued in june 2013 the 100 convertible notes may limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt paying dividends repurchasing shares and acquiring or disposing of assets or businesses in addition we have granted a security interest in connection with certain compensatory arrangements which limits our ability to incur senior debt in excess of certain amounts accordingly we may be restricted from taking actions that management believes would be desirable and in the best interests of us and our stockholders our credit agreement and the indentures also require us to satisfy specified financial and nonfinancial covenants a breach of any of the covenants contained in our credit agreement could result in an event of default under the agreement and under the indentures governing our 100 convertible notes and would allow our lenders and noteholders to pursue various remedies including accelerating the repayment of any outstanding indebtedness 

our business and products are subject to potential legislation the adoption of such proposed legislation could limit the retail market for our products 

several proposals have been made for federal legislation to regulate our industry such proposals seek to prohibit the sale of products containing certain content included in some of our games if any such proposals are enacted into law it may limit the potential market for some of our games in the united states and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results other countries such as germany have adopted laws regulating content both in packaged games and those transmitted over the internet that are stricter than current united states laws in the united states proposals have also been made by numerous state legislators to regulate and prohibit the sale of interactive entertainment software products containing certain types of violent or sexual content to under 17 or 18 audiences such as the state of californias ultraviolent video games law that sought to ban the sale or rental of violent video games to minors while such legislation to date has been enjoined by industry and retail groups or been found unconstitutional the adoption into law of such legislation in federal andor in state jurisdictions in which we do significant business could severely limit the retail market for some of our games 

we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill becomes impaired 

we are required under us generally accepted accounting principles to review our goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating a requirement to reevaluate whether our goodwill continues to be recoverable include a significant decline in stock price and market capitalization slower growth rates in our industry or other materially adverse events we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill is determined this may adversely affect our operating results 

our reported financial results could be adversely affected by the application of existing or future accounting standards to our business as it evolves 

our reported financial results are affected by the accounting policies promulgated by the sec and national accounting standards bodies and the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies for example standards regarding revenue recognition have and could further significantly affect the way we account for revenue related to our products and services we expect that an increasing number of our games will be onlineenabled in the future and that we could be required to recognize the related revenues over a period of time rather than at the time of sale further as we increase our downloadable content and 

add new features to our online services our estimate of the service period may change and we could be required to recognize revenues and defer related costs over a shorter or longer period of time than we initially allocated as we enhance expand and diversify our business and product offerings the application of existing or future financial accounting standards particularly those relating to the way we account for revenue could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results although not necessarily on our cash flows 

risks relating to our common stock 

for purposes of this section risks relating to our common stock references to the company we our and us refer only to taketwo interactive software inc and not to its subsidiaries 

additional issuances or sales of equity securities by us would dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

we may issue equity or equitybased securities such as our 100 convertible notes in the future in connection with acquisitions or strategic transactions to adjust our ratio of debt to equity including through repayment of outstanding debt to fund expansion of our operations or for other purposes to the extent we issue additional equity securities including upon conversion of our outstanding 100 convertible notes the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders would be reduced the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect its price the sale or the availability for sale of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause the price of our common stock to decline the issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of our 100 convertible notes could also adversely affect the price of our common stock 

there is no guarantee that we will do additional share repurchases in the future 

the share repurchase program authorized by the board of directors which authorized the repurchase of up to 14217683  shares of our common stock and had 9046353  shares available for repurchase as of march 31 2017  does not obligate the company to make any purchases at any specific time or situation discontinuing repurchases could adversely affect the price of the companys common stock the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time for any reason 

our stock price has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly 

the market price of our common stock historically has been and we expect will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us including those discussed in the risk factors in this section as well as others not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material to changes in securities analysts earnings estimates or ratings to our results or future financial guidance falling below our expectations and analysts and investors expectations to factors affecting the computer software entertainment media or electronics industries or to national or international economic conditions 

stock markets in general have experienced over the years and continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected market prices for companies such as ours and that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the affected companies these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock regardless of our operating performance 

delaware law our charter documents and provisions of our debt agreements may impede or discourage a takeover which could cause the market price of our shares to decline 

we are a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a thirdparty to acquire control of us even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders our board of directors has the power without stockholder approval to adopt a stockholder rights plan andor to designate the terms of one or more series of preferred stock and issue shares of preferred stock in addition we may under certain circumstances involving a change of control be obligated to repurchase all or a portion of our 100 convertible notes and any potential acquirer would be required to assume our obligations related to any outstanding 100 convertible notes we or any possible acquirer may not have available financial resources necessary to repurchase those notes the ability of our board of directors to create and issue a new series of preferred stock and certain provisions of delaware law our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the indenture governing our notes could impede a merger takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock which under certain circumstances could reduce the market price of our common stock and the value of any outstanding notes 

our ability to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to reduce future years taxes could be substantially limited under internal revenue code sections 382 and 383 if we experience an ownership change as defined in the internal revenue code section 382 

section 382 of the internal revenue code contains rules that limit the ability of a company to use its net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in years after an ownership change which is generally defined as any change in ownership of more than 50 of its stock over a threeyear testing period these rules generally operate by focusing on ownership changes among stockholders owning directly or indirectly 5 or more of the stock of a company andor any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of stock by the company if as a result of future transactions involving our common stock including purchases or sales of stock by 5 stockholders we undergo cumulative ownership changes which exceed 50 over the testing period our ability to use our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards would be subject to additional limitations under sections 382 and 383 

generally if an ownership change occurs the annual taxable income limitation on the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is equal to the product of the applicable longterm tax exempt rate and the value of the companys stock immediately before the ownership change depending on the resulting limitation a portion of our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards could expire before we would be able to use them 

our inability to fully utilize our net operating losses to reduce tax liability in the future could have a material and negative affect on our future financial position and results of operations

our revenue is primarily derived from the sale of internally developed software titles and software titles developed by thirdparties operating margins are dependent in part upon our ability to release new commercially successful software products and to manage effectively their development costs we have internal development studios located in canada china czech republic the united kingdom and the united states 

software titles published by our rockstar games label are primarily internally developed we expect rockstar games our whollyowned publisher of the grand theft auto  max payne  midnight club  red dead  and other popular franchises to continue to be a leader in the action  adventure product category and to create groundbreaking entertainment by leveraging our existing titles as well as by developing new brands we believe that rockstar has established a uniquely original popular cultural phenomenon with its grand theft auto  series which is the interactive entertainment industrys most iconic and critically acclaimed brand and has soldin over 260 million units the latest installment grand theft auto v  was released on sonys ps3 and microsofts xbox 360 in september 2013 on sonys ps4 and microsofts xbox one in november 2014 and on pc in april 2015 grand theft auto v  includes access to grand theft auto online  which initially launched in october 2013 rockstar games is also well known for developing brands in other genres including the la noire  bully  and manhunt  franchises rockstar games continues to expand on our established franchises by developing sequels offering downloadable episodes content and virtual currency and releasing titles for smartphones and tablets

on january 31 2017 taketwo acquired privatelyheld social point refer to note 23 of our consolidated financial statements founded in 2008 and headquartered in barcelona spain social point is a highlysuccessful freetoplay mobile game developer and publisher that focuses on delivering highquality deeplyengaging entertainment experiences social point currently has multiple profitable titles in the market including its two most successful games dragon city  and monster legends  in addition social point has a robust development pipeline with a number of exciting games planned for launch over the next two years social point’s games currently are available in north america latin america and emea and approximately 50 of its revenue is derived from the united states in 2016 over 90 of its revenue was generated from mobile platforms 

trends and factors affecting our business 

product release schedule our financial results are affected by the timing of our product releases and the commercial success of those titles our grand theft auto  products in particular have historically accounted for a significant portion of our revenue sales of grand theft auto  products generated 382  of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2017  the timing of our grand theft auto  product releases may affect our financial performance on a quarterly and annual basis 

economic environment and retailer performance we continue to monitor economic conditions that may unfavorably affect our businesses such as deteriorating consumer demand pricing pressure on our products credit quality of our receivables and foreign currency exchange rates our business is dependent upon a limited number of customers that account for a significant portion of our revenue our five largest customers accounted for 655  589  and 646  of net revenue during the fiscal years ended march 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively as of march 31 2017 and 2016 five customers comprised 699  and 739  of our gross accounts receivable respectively with our significant customers those that individually comprised more than 10 of our gross accounts receivable balance accounting for 576  and 641  of such balance at march 31 2017 and 2016 respectively we had two customers who accounted for 402  and 174  of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2017 and three customers who accounted for 352  168  and 121  of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2016 we did not have any additional customers that exceeded 10 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2017 and 2016 the economic environment has affected our customers in the past and may do so in the future bankruptcies or consolidations of our large retail customers could seriously hurt our business due to uncollectible accounts receivables and the concentration of purchasing power among the remaining large retailers certain of our large customers sell used copies of our games which may negatively affect our business by reducing demand for new copies of our games while the downloadable content that we now offer for certain of our titles may serve to reduce used game sales we expect used game sales to continue to adversely affect our business 

hardware platforms we derive most of our revenue from the sale of products made for video game consoles manufactured by thirdparties such as sonys ps4 and ps3 and microsofts xbox one and xbox 360 which comprised 810  of our net revenue by product platform for the fiscal year ended march 31 2017 the success of our business is dependent upon the consumer acceptance of these consoles and continued growth in their installed base when new hardware platforms are introduced demand for software used on older platforms typically declines which may negatively affect our business during the market transition to the new consoles we continually monitor console hardware sales we manage our product delivery on each current and future platform in a manner we believe to be most effective to maximize our revenue opportunities and achieve the desired return on our investments in product development accordingly our strategy is to focus our development efforts on a select number of the highest quality titles for these platforms while also expanding our offerings for emerging platforms such as tablets smartphones and online games 

online content and digital distribution the interactive entertainment software industry is delivering a growing amount of content through digital online delivery methods we provide a variety of online delivered products and offerings most of our titles that are available through retailers as packaged goods products are also available through direct digital download from websites we own and others owned by thirdparties in addition we aim to drive ongoing engagement and incremental revenue from recurrent consumer spending on our titles after their initial purchase through downloadable offerings including addon content microtransactions and online play we also publish an expanding variety of titles for tablets and smartphones which are delivered to consumers through digital download via the internet note 17 to the consolidated financial statements segment and geographic information discloses that net revenue from digital online channels comprised 518  of our net revenue by distribution channel for the fiscal year ended march 31 2017 we expect online delivery of games and game offerings to continue to grow and to become an increasing part of our business over the longterm 

product releases 

we released the following key titles in fiscal year 2017 



product pipeline 

we have announced the following key titles to date this list does not represent all titles currently in development 



fiscal 2017 financial summary 

our net revenue for fiscal year ended march 31 2017 was led by titles from a variety of our top franchises primarily grand theft auto  nba 2k  and wwe 2k  our net revenue increased to 17797 million  an increase of 3661 million  or 259  compared to the fiscal year ended march 31 2016 

for the fiscal year ended march 31 2017 our net income was 673 million  as compared to a net loss of 83 million  in the prior year diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended march 31 2017 was 072  as compared to a loss per share of 010  for the fiscal year ended march 31 2016 our operating income for the fiscal year ended march 31 2017 increased compared to the operating loss for fiscal year ended march 31 2016 due primarily to higher gross profit from sales of our titles and the business reorganization charges incurred in 2016 not recurring in 2017 offset by higher operating expenses primarily as a result of an increase in selling and marketing expense 

at march 31 2017 we had 9434 million  of cash and cash equivalents compared to 7987 million  at march 31 2016 the increase in cash and cash equivalents from march 31 2016 was due primarily to cash provided by operating activities partially offset by cash used in investing and financing activities the increase in net cash provided by operations was due primarily to cash generated from sales of grand theft auto v  nba 2k17  wwe 2k17  mafia iii  and virtual currency partially offset by investments in software development and licenses and the funding of internal royalty payments net cash used in investing and financing activities related primarily to our acquisition of social point and the net share settlements of stockbased awards 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we base our estimates assumptions and judgments on historical experience current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared on a regular basis management reviews the accounting policies assumptions estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are fairly presented in accordance with us gaap however because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 

we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our financial results and they require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the effect and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue on the sales of software products upon the transfer of title and risk of loss to our customers accordingly we recognize revenue for software titles when there is 1 persuasive evidence that an arrangement with the customer exists 2 the product is delivered 3 the selling price is fixed or determinable and 4 collection of the customer receivable is deemed probable certain products are sold to customers with a street date  ie the earliest date these products may be sold by retailers for these products we recognize revenue on the later of the street date or the sale date in addition some of our software products are sold as full game digital downloads and digital addon content for which the consumer takes possession of the digital content for a fee revenue from product downloads is generally recognized when the download is made available to the end user assuming all other recognition criteria are met 

in providing credit terms to our customers our payment arrangements typically provide net 30 and 60 day terms advances received for licensing and exclusivity arrangements are reported on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred revenue until we meet our performance obligations at which point we recognize the revenue 

for some of our software products we enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which we may provide a combination of full game software online multiplayer functionality and related postcontract customer support pcs which generally includes additional free unspecified addon content updates maintenance and online support services for these arrangements we evaluate the significance of the pcs at the time each game is released based on the guidance in accounting standards codification 985605 software—revenue recognition asc 985605 to determine if the pcs rises to the level of a separate deliverable we monitor our initial assessments on an ongoing basis and consider any changes that may arise in conjunction with our evaluation we consider such factors as the significance of the development effort the nature of online features the extent of anticipated marketing focus on online features the significance of the online features to the consumers anticipated overall gameplay experience and the significance and length of time of our post sale obligations to consumers determining whether pcs is significant for a particular game is subjective and requires managements judgment 

when a software arrangement includes multiple elements the arrangement consideration is allocated to each revenue element based on its relative fair value based on the vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for each element when vsoe of fair value does not exist for all of the elements in the arrangement asc 985605 requires either the use of the residual method or the deferral of revenue until the earlier point at which vsoe of fair value exists for any undelivered element or until only one undelivered element remains for arrangements that require the deferral of revenue the related cost of goods sold is deferred and recognized as the related net revenue is recognized deferred cost of goods sold includes product costs and licenses we do not have vsoe for our pcs obligations and in those arrangements where pcs obligations have been determined to be significant we recognize revenue from the sale of software products and the related cost of goods sold ratably over the period we expect to offer the pcs to the consumer estimated service period assuming all other recognition criteria are met we also do not have vsoe for our online multiplayer functionality however it is generally delivered at the same time with the full game software determining the estimated service period is subjective and requires managements judgment therefore the estimated service period may change in the future the estimated service periods of our current games with online functionality and related pcs are generally 12 to 41 months 

when our software products provide insignificant pcs at no additional cost to the consumer we recognize revenue when the four primary revenue recognition criteria described above have been met for all other deliverables in the arrangement and in those situations we estimate and accrue the future costs of providing those services 

certain of our games provide consumers with the option to purchase virtual currency to use in the game to acquire virtual goods we currently recognize revenue from the sale of virtual currency using the gamebased model ratably over the estimated remaining life of the game because the service period for our onlineenabled games with significant pcs is not an explicitly defined period we must make an estimate of the service offering period for purposes of recognizing revenue the estimated service period for current deferred title offerings is based on our estimate of the economic game life of the respective title determining the estimated service period or economic game life is inherently subjective and is subject to regular revision based on numerous factors and considerations the factors that we primarily consider as part of our process of initially determining and subsequently reassessing estimated service periods for our titles include 

 to the extent we have recorded significant amounts of revenue deferred for specific titles changes in the estimated service periods could have a material impact on the revenue recognized in a particular period 

as part of our ongoing assessment of estimated service periods during the three months ended march 31 2017  we changed grand theft auto vs estimated service period from 36  to 41 months the change in estimate resulted in a decrease in net revenues 

of 29367  and income from operations of 27070   to our fiscal 2017 financial results with such revenues expected to be recognized in fiscal 2018 

revenue is recognized after deducting estimated price protection reserves for returns and other allowances in circumstances when we do not have a reliable basis to estimate price protection returns and other allowances or are unable to determine that collection of a receivable is probable we defer the revenue until we can reliably estimate any related returns and allowances and determine that collection of the receivable is probable 

price protection and allowances for returns 

we grant price protection and accept returns in connection with our publishing arrangements following reductions in the price of our products we grant price protection to permit customers to take credits against amounts they owe us with respect to merchandise unsold by them our customers must satisfy certain conditions to entitle them to receive price protection or return products including compliance with applicable payment terms and confirmation of field inventory levels 

generally our distribution arrangements with customers do not give them the right to return titles or to cancel firm orders however we occasionally accept returns from our customers for stock balancing and make accommodations to customers which include credits and returns when demand for specific titles falls below expectations 

we make estimates of future price protection and product returns related to current period product revenue we estimate the amount of future price protection and returns for published titles based upon among other factors historical experience and performance of the titles in similar genres historical performance of the hardware platform customer inventory levels analysis of sellthrough rates sales force and retail customer feedback industry pricing market conditions and changes in demand and acceptance of our products by consumers 

significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing price protection and the allowance for returns in any accounting period we believe we can make reliable estimates of price protection and returns however actual results may differ from initial estimates as a result of changes in circumstances market conditions and assumptions adjustments to estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 

software development costs and licenses 

capitalized software development costs include direct costs incurred for internally developed titles and payments made to thirdparty software developers under development agreements 

we capitalize internal software development costs including stockbased compensation specifically identifiable employee payroll expense and incentive compensation costs related to the completion and release of titles thirdparty production and other content costs subsequent to establishing technological feasibility of a software title technological feasibility of a product includes the completion of both technical design documentation and game design documentation significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of when technological feasibility is established for products where proven technology exists this may occur early in the development cycle technological feasibility is evaluated on a product by product basis 

we enter into agreements with thirdparty developers that require us to make payments for game development and production services in exchange for our payments we receive the exclusive publishing and distribution rights to the finished game title as well as in some cases the underlying intellectual property rights such agreements typically allow us to fully recover these payments to the developers at an agreed upon royalty rate earned on the subsequent sales of such software net of any agreed upon costs prior to establishing technological feasibility of a product we record any costs incurred by thirdparty developers as research and development expenses subsequent to establishing technological feasibility of a product we capitalize all development and production service payments to thirdparty developers as software development costs and licenses we typically enter into agreements with thirdparty developers after completing the technical design documentation for our products and therefore record the design costs leading up to a signed development contract as research and development expense when we contract with thirdparty developers we generally select those that have proven technology and experience in the genre of the software being developed which often allows for the establishment of technological feasibility early in the development cycle in instances where the documentation of the design and technology are not in place prior to an executed contract we monitor the software development process and require our thirdparty developers to adhere to the same technological feasibility standards that apply to our internally developed products 

licenses consist of payments and guarantees made to holders of intellectual property rights for use of their trademarks copyrights or other intellectual property rights in the development of our products agreements with license holders generally provide for guaranteed minimum payments for use of their intellectual property certain licenses especially those related to our sports products extend over multiyear periods and encompass multiple game titles in addition to guaranteed minimum payments these licenses frequently contain provisions that could require us to pay royalties to the license holder based on preagreed unit sales thresholds 

amortization of capitalized software development costs and licenses commences when a product is released and is recorded on a titlebytitle basis in cost of goods sold for capitalized software development costs amortization is calculated using 1 the proportion of current year revenues to the total revenues expected to be recorded over the life of the title or 2 the straightline method over the remaining estimated useful life of the title whichever is greater for capitalized licenses amortization is calculated as a ratio of 1 current period revenues to the total revenues expected to be recorded over the remaining life of the title or 2 the contractual royalty rate based on actual net product sales as defined in the licensing agreement whichever is greater 

we evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized software development costs and licenses on a quarterly basis recoverability is primarily assessed based on the actual titles performance for products that are scheduled to be released in the future recoverability is evaluated based on the expected performance of the specific products to which the cost or license relates we utilize a number of criteria in evaluating expected product performance including historical performance of comparable products developed with comparable technology market performance of comparable titles orders for the product prior to its release general market conditions and past performance of the franchise when we determine that the value of the title is unlikely to be recovered by product sales capitalized costs are charged to cost of goods sold in the period in which such determination is made 

we have profit and unit sales based internal royalty programs that allow selected employees to each participate in the success of software titles that they assist in developing royalties earned under this program are recorded as a component of cost of goods sold in the period earned 

fair value estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap often requires us to determine the fair value of a particular item to fairly present our consolidated financial statements without an independent market or another representative transaction determining the fair value of a particular item requires us to make several assumptions that are inherently difficult to predict and can have a material influence on the conclusion of the appropriate accounting 

various valuation techniques are used to estimate fair value these include 1 the market approach where market transactions for identical or comparable assets or liabilities are used to determine the fair value 2 the income approach which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts for example future cash flows or future earnings to a single present amount and 3 the cost approach which is based on the amount that would be required to replace an asset for many of our fair value estimates including our estimates of the fair value of acquired intangible assets we use the income approach using the income approach requires the use of financial models which require us to make various estimates including but not limited to 1 the potential future cash flows for the asset liability or equity instrument being measured 2 the timing of receipt or payment of those future cash flows 3 the time value of money associated with the delayed receipt or payment of such cash flows and 4 the inherent risk associated with the cash flows risk premium developing these cash flow estimates is inherently difficult and subjective and if any of the estimates used to determine the fair value using the income approach turn out to be inaccurate our financial results may be negatively affected furthermore relatively small changes in many of these estimates can have a significant influence on the estimated fair value resulting from the financial models or the related accounting conclusion reached for example a relatively small change in the estimated fair value of an asset may change a conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired while we are required to make certain fair value assessments associated with the accounting for several types of transactions the following areas are the most sensitive to the assessments 

business combinations—goodwill and intangible assets we must estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these can have a material effect on our reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various lives goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible assets and intangible assets acquired in a business combination a change in the estimated fair value of an acquired asset or liability assumed often has a direct influence on the amount recognized as goodwill which is an asset that is not amortized often determining the fair value of these acquired assets and liabilities assumed requires an assessment of expected use of the asset the expected cost to extinguish the liability or our expectations related to the timing and the successful completion of development of an acquired inprocess technology such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material influence on our financial statements 

we use either the income cost or market approach to aid in our conclusions of such fair values and asset lives the income approach presumes that the value of an asset can be estimated by the net economic benefit to be received over the life of the asset discounted to present value the cost approach presumes that an investor would pay no more for an asset than its replacement or reproduction cost the market approach estimates value based on what other participants in the market have paid for reasonably similar assets although each valuation approach is considered in valuing the assets acquired the approach ultimately selected is based on the characteristics of the asset and the availability of information 

we test our goodwill for impairment annually in our second fiscal quarter or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying amount a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one 

level below an operating segment we have determined that we operate in one reporting unit which is our operating segment the determination of whether or not goodwill has become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units changes in our strategy andor market conditions could significantly affect these judgments and require reductions to recorded intangible asset balances we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the fair value of its reporting unit is more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than 50 less than its carrying value before performing the twostep impairment test if the twostep impairment test for goodwill is utilized step one compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value if the carrying value exceeds the fair value there is a potential impairment and step two must be performed step two compares the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill to its implied fair value ie fair value of reporting unit less the fair value of the units assets and liabilities including identifiable intangible assets if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount of goodwill an impairment is recognized based on our annual impairment assessment process for goodwill no impairments were recorded during the fiscal year ended march 31 2017  or 2016  

longlived assets we review longlived assets including definitelived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable determining whether impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions including determining which cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset the useful life over which cash flows will occur their amount and the assets residual value if any in turn measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value which is based on the best information available we use internal discounted cash flow estimates quoted market prices when available and independent appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value we derive the required cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans and apply an appropriate discount rate recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset with future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 

inventory obsolescence we regularly review inventory quantities onhand and in the retail channels and record an inventory provision for excess or obsolete inventory based on the future expected demand for our products significant changes in demand for our products would affect managements estimates in establishing our inventory provision we write down inventory based on excess or obsolete inventories determined primarily by future anticipated demand for our products inventory writedowns are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand that are inherently difficult to assess 

stockbased compensation 

we account for stockbased awards under the fair value method of accounting the fair value of all stockbased compensation is either capitalized and amortized in accordance with our software development cost accounting policy or recognized as expense on a straightline basis over the full vesting period of the awards 

we estimate the fair value of timebased awards to employees using our closing stock price on the date of grant we estimate the fair value of marketbased awards using a monte carlo simulation method which takes into account assumptions such as the expected volatility of our common stock the riskfree interest rate based on the contractual term of the award expected dividend yield vesting schedule and the probability that the market conditions of the awards will be achieved 

we apply variable accounting to our nonemployee stockbased awards whereby we remeasure the value of such awards at each balance sheet date and adjust the value of the awards based on its fair value at the end of the reporting period for nonemployee timebased awards fair value is determined by the closing price of our common stock at the end of the reporting period for nonemployee marketbased awards fair value is determined using a monte carlo simulation method which takes into account assumptions such as the expected volatility of our common stock the riskfree interest rate based on the contractual term of the award expected dividend yield vesting schedule and the probability that the market conditions of the awards will be achieved for nonemployee performancebased awards we do not record an expense until a performance targets have been achieved and once achieved fair value is determined by the closing price of our common stock at the end of the reporting period 

we issue time and performance based restricted stock units to certain employees which currently can only be settled in cash these awards are accounted for as liability awards changes in the value of the awards from period to period are recorded as stockbased compensation expense over the vesting period 

see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our stockbased compensation arrangements 

income taxes 

we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred income taxes are recognized for differences between 

the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at currently enacted statutory tax rates for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized our history of pretax losses represents sufficient evidence for us to determine that the establishment of a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset is appropriate this valuation allowance offsets deferred tax assets associated with future tax deductions as well as carryforward items 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in addition our filed tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

accounting for acquisitions or disposals 

in january 2017 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update asu 201701 clarifying the definition of a business  with the objective of providing additional guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses the amendments in this update provide new guidance to determine when an integrated set of assets and activities collectively referred to as a “set” is not a business the new guidance requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired or disposed of is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets the set is not a business the new guidance is expected to reduce the number of transactions that need to be further evaluated the new standard as amended will be effective for the company prospectively for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on january 1 2018 april 1 2018 for the company with early adoption permitted we intend to early adopt this asu for the quarterly period ending june 30 2017 and believe that the evaluation of whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or dispositions of assets or businesses will be simplified under the new standard 

accounting for goodwill 

in january 2017 the fasb issued asu 201704 intangibles  goodwill and other topic 350  this asu eliminates step 2 from the goodwill impairment test under the new guidance an entity should perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value additionally this asu eliminates the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment and if it fails that qualitative test to perform step 2 of the goodwill impairment test the amendments in this asu are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2019 april 1 2020 for the company including interim periods within those fiscal years and is applied on a prospective basis early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after january 1 2017 while we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this asu we do not believe that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

accounting for restricted cash 

in november 2016 the fasb issued asu 201618 statement of cash flows topic 230 restricted cash  this asu amends the presentation of restricted cash within the statement of cash flows the new guidance requires that changes in restricted cash and cash equivalents be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginningofperiod and endofperiod total amounts on the statement of cash flows this standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2017 april 1 2018 for the company including interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this asu 

accounting for stock compensation 

in march 2016 the fasb issued asu 201609 compensation—stock compensation  this new guidance identifies areas for simplification involving several aspects of accounting for sharebased payment transactions including the income tax consequences classification of awards as either equity or liabilities an option to recognize gross stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur as well as certain classifications on the statement of cash flows this update is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 april 1 2017 for the company and interim periods within those annual periods in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 the company will apply a modified retrospective transition method to account for the changes under the standard related to income taxes and the policy election for recording forfeitures as they occur 

accounting for leases 

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu 201602 leases  this new guidance requires lessees to recognize a rightofuse asset and a lease liability for virtually all leases other than leases that meet the definition of a shortterm lease the liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments the asset will be based on the liability subject to adjustment such as for initial direct costs for income statement purposes the fasb retained a dual model requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance operating leases will result in straightline expense similar to current operating leases while finance leases will result in a frontloaded expense pattern similar to current capital leases classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting this update is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2018 april 1 2019 for the company this new guidance must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach whereby lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach early adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this update on our consolidated financial statements which will consist primarily of a balance sheet gross up of our operating leases mostly for office space 

revenue from contracts with customers 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606  under the new standard revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services in addition the standard requires disclosure of the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers the fasb recently issued several amendments to the standard including clarifications on disclosure of priorperiod performance obligations and remaining performance obligations 

  

the guidance permits two methods of adoption retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented full retrospective method or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application the cumulative catchup transition method 

the new standard is effective for annual reporting periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after december 15 2017 april 1 2018 for the company with early adoption permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after december 15 2016 april 1 2017 for the company we will adopt the new standard effective april 1 2018 using the cumulative catchup method 

we anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements while we are continuing to assess all potential impacts of the standard we currently believe the most significant impact relates to our accounting for online enabled games that benefit from meaningful game related services such as unspecified content updates and online support services for which we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe 

under the current accounting standards for titles that do not have vsoe we recognize the entire sales price ratably over the titles estimated service period the vsoe requirement will be eliminated under the new standard accordingly we may be required to recognize as revenue a portion of the sales price upon delivery of the software as compared to the current requirement of recognizing the entire sales price ratably over an estimated offering period

the 100  convertible notes are convertible at an initial conversion rate of 464727  shares of our common stock per 1  principal amount of 100  convertible notes representing an initial conversion price of approximately 2152  per share of common stock for a total of approximately 13361000  underlying conversion shares subject to adjustment in certain circumstances holders may convert the 100  convertible notes at their option prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding january 1 2018 only under the following circumstances 1 during any fiscal quarter commencing after september 30 2013 if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least 20  trading days whether or not consecutive during a period of 30  consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130  of the applicable conversion price on each applicable trading day 2 during the five  business day period after any 10  consecutive trading day period the measurement period in which the trading price per 1000  principal amount of 100  convertible notes for each day of that measurement period was less than 98  of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the applicable conversion rate on each such day or 3 upon the occurrence of specified corporate events on and after january 1 2018 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date holders may convert their 100  convertible notes at any time regardless of the foregoing circumstances upon conversion the 100  convertible notes may be settled at our election in cash shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock our common stock price exceeded 130  of the applicable conversion price per share for at least 20  trading days during the 30  consecutive trading days ended march 31 2017  accordingly as of april 1 2017 the 100  convertible notes may be converted at the holders option through june 30 2017 during the year ended march 31 2017 100 convertible notes with an aggregate principal value of 194 million  were settled and additional 100 convertible notes with aggregate principal value of 01 million  were tendered for conversion with april 2017 settlement dates we elected to settle in shares of our common stock and our current intent and ability given our option would be to settle future conversions in shares of our common stock as such we have continued to classify these 100  convertible notes as longterm debt 

upon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes involving the company holders of the 100  convertible notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their 100  convertible notes for cash at a price equal to 100  of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus accrued and unpaid interest including additional interest if any to but excluding the fundamental change purchase date 

the indenture governing the 100  convertible notes contains customary terms and covenants and events of default if an event of default as defined therein occurs and is continuing the trustee by notice to the company or the holders of at least 25  in aggregate principal amount of the 100  convertible notes then outstanding by notice to the company and the trustee may and the trustee at the request of such holders shall declare 100  of the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest including additional interest if any on all the 100  convertible notes to be due and payable in the case of an event of default arising out of certain bankruptcy events 100  of the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest including additional interest if any on the 100  convertible notes will automatically become due and payable immediately 

the 100  convertible notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank senior in right of payment to our existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 100  convertible notes equal in right of payment to our existing and future indebtedness that is not so subordinated effectively junior in right of payment to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness incurred by our subsidiaries 

financial condition 

we are subject to credit risks particularly if any of our receivables represent a limited number of customers or are concentrated in foreign markets if we are unable to collect our accounts receivable as they become due it could adversely affect our liquidity and working capital position 

generally we have been able to collect our accounts receivable in the ordinary course of business we do not hold any collateral to secure payment from customers we have trade credit insurance on the majority of our customers to mitigate accounts receivable risk 

a majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to major retailers and distributors our five largest customers accounted for 655  589 and 646 of net revenue during the fiscal years ended march 31 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively as of march 31 2017 and 2016 five customers accounted for 699  and 739 of our gross accounts receivable respectively customers that individually accounted for more than 10 of our gross accounts receivable balance comprised 576  and 641 of such balances at march 31 2017 and 2016 respectively we had two customers who accounted for 402 and 174 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2017 and three customers who accounted for 352 and 168 and 121 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2016 we did not have any additional customers that exceeded 10 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2017 and 2016 based upon performing ongoing credit evaluations maintaining trade credit insurance on a majority of our customers and our past collection experience we believe that the receivable balances from these largest customers do not represent a significant credit risk although we actively monitor each customers credit worthiness and economic conditions that may affect our customers business and access to capital we are monitoring the current global economic conditions including credit markets and other factors as it relates to our customers in order to manage the risk of uncollectible accounts receivable 

we believe our current cash short term investments and projected cash flow from operations along with availability under our credit agreement will provide us with sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash requirements for working capital capital expenditures and commitments on both a shortterm and longterm basis 

as of march 31 2017 the amount of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the us by our foreign subsidiaries was  2392 million these balances are dispersed across various locations around the world we believe that such dispersion meets the business and liquidity needs of our foreign affiliates in addition we expect to have the ability to generate sufficient cash domestically to support ongoing operations for the foreseeable future consequently it is the companys intention to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries in the event we needed to repatriate funds outside of the us such repatriation may be subject to local laws and tax consequences including foreign withholding taxes or us income taxes it is not practicable to estimate the tax liability and we would try to minimize the tax effect to the extent possible however any repatriation may not result in significant cash payments as the taxable event would likely be offset by the utilization of the then available tax credits 

in january 2013 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 7500000 shares of our common stock during the fiscal year ended march 31 2014 we repurchased 4217683 shares of our common stock in the open market for 733 million as part of the program in may 2015 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 6717683 shares of our common stock pursuant to the share repurchase program during the fiscal year ended march 31 2016 we repurchased 953647 shares of our common stock in the open market for 266 million as part of the program as of march 31 2017 we have repurchased a total of 5171330 shares of our common stock and have 9046353 shares of our common stock that remain available for repurchase under our share repurchase authorization we are authorized to purchase shares from time to time through a variety of methods including in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws repurchases are subject to the availability of stock prevailing market conditions the trading price of the stock our financial performance and other conditions the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time for any reason 

our changes in cash flows were as follows 



at march 31 2017 we had 9434 million  of cash and cash equivalents compared to 7987 million  at march 31 2016 the increase in cash and cash equivalents from march 31 2016 was due primarily to cash provided by operating activities partially offset by cash used in investing and financing activities net cash provided by operating activites was due primarily to cash generated from sales of grand theft auto v  nba 2k17  wwe 2k17  mafia iii  and virtual currency partially offset by investments in software development and licenses and the funding of internal royalty payments net cash used in investing and financing activities related primarily to our acquisition of social point and the repurchase of common stock and net share settlements of stockbased awards 

contractual obligations and commitments 

we have entered into various agreements in the ordinary course of business that require substantial cash commitments over the next several years generally these include 

• software development and licensing we make payments to thirdparty software developers that include contractual payments to developers under several software development agreements that expire at various times through january 2022 our aggregate outstanding software development commitments assume satisfactory performance by thirdparty software developers we also have licensing commitments that primarily consist of obligations to holders of intellectual property rights for use of their trademarks copyrights technology or other intellectual property rights in the development of our products 

• marketing we have certain minimum marketing support commitments where we commit to spend specified amounts related to marketing our products marketing commitments expire at various times through december 2022 

• operating leases our offices are occupied under noncancelable operating leases expiring at various times through december 2032 we also lease certain furniture equipment and automobiles under noncancelable leases expiring through march 2021 some of the leases have fixed rent increases and also include inducements to enter into the lease the effect of such amounts are deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the related lease term 

• purchase obligations primarily related to agreements to purchase services that are enforceable and legally binding on the company that specifies all significant terms including fixed minimum or variable pricing provisions and the approximate timing of the transactions expiring at various times through september 2021 

a summary of annual minimum contractual obligations and commitments as of march 31 2017 is as follows in thousands of dollars 



income taxes   at march 31 2017  we had recorded a liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties of 369  million for which we are unable to make a reasonable and reliable estimate of the period in which these liabilities will be settled with the respective tax authorities therefore these liabilities have not been included in the contractual obligations table 

legal and other proceedings   we are or may become subject to demands and claims including intellectual property claims and are involved in routine litigation in the ordinary course of business which we do not believe to be material to our business or financial statements we have appropriately accrued amounts related to certain of these claims and legal and other proceedings while it is reasonably possible that a loss may be incurred in excess of the amounts accrued in our financial statements we believe that such losses unless otherwise disclosed would not be material 

on april 11 2016 we filed a declaratory judgment action in the united states district court for the southern district of new york seeking among other things a judicial declaration that leslie benzies the former president of one of our subsidiaries with whom we had been in ongoing discussions regarding his separation of employment is not entitled to any minimum allocation or financial parity with any other person under the applicable royalty plan we believe we will prevail in this matter although there can be no assurance of the outcome on april 12 2016 mr benzies filed a complaint in the supreme court of the state of new york new york county against us and certain of our subsidiaries and employees we removed this case to the united states district court for the southern district of new york but the case was subsequently remanded to state court the complaint claims damages of at least 150 million and contains allegations of breach of fiduciary duty fraudulent inducement and fraudulent concealment aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty breach of various contracts breach of implied duty of good faith and fair dealing tortious interference with contract unjust enrichment reformation constructive trust declaration of rights constructive discharge defamation and fraud motion practice in both the federal and state actions is ongoing we believe that we have meritorious defenses to these claims and we intend to vigorously defend against them and to pursue any counterclaims 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of march 31 2017 and 2016 we did not have any material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial parties such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such we are not exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 

international operations 

net revenue earned outside of the united states is principally generated by our operations in europe asia australia canada and latin america for the fiscal years ended march 31 2017 2016 and 2015 439 474 and 425 respectively of our net revenue was earned outside the united states we are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade including increased credit risks tariffs and duties fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates shipping delays and international political regulatory and economic developments all of which can have a significant effect on our operating results 

fluctuations in quarterly operating results and seasonality 

we have experienced fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results as a result of the timing of the introduction of new titles variations in sales of titles developed for particular platforms market acceptance of our titles development and promotional expenses relating to the introduction of new titles sequels or enhancements of existing titles projected and actual changes in platforms the timing and success of title introductions by our competitors product returns changes in pricing policies by us and our competitors the accuracy of retailers forecasts of consumer demand the size and timing of acquisitions the timing of orders from major customers and order cancellations and delays in product shipment sales of our products are also seasonal with peak shipments typically occurring in the fourth calendar quarter as a result of increased demand for products during the holiday season for certain of our software products with multiple element revenue arrangements where we do not have vsoe for each element and the deliverables are deemed morethaninconsequential we defer the recognition of our net revenues over an estimated service period which generally ranges from 12 to 41 months as a result the quarter in which we generate the highest net sales volume may be different from the quarter in which we recognize the highest amount of net revenues quarterly comparisons of operating results are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential loss arising from fluctuations in market rates and prices our market risk exposures primarily include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates relates primarily to our shortterm investment portfolio and variable rate debt under the credit agreement 

we seek to manage our interest rate risk by maintaining a shortterm investment portfolio that includes corporate bonds with high credit quality and maturities less than two years since shortterm investments mature relatively quickly and can be reinvested at the thencurrent market rates interest income on a portfolio consisting of shortterm securities is more subject to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer term maturities however the fair value of a shortterm portfolio is less sensitive to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer term securities we do not currently use derivative financial instruments in our shortterm investment portfolio our investments are held for purposes other than trading 

as of march 31 2017  we had 4489 million  of shortterm investments which included 2732 million  of availableforsale securities the availableforsale securities were recorded at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax in stockholders equity we also had 9434 million of cash and cash equivalents that are comprised primarily of money market funds and banktime deposits we determined that based on the composition of our investment portfolio there was no material interest rate risk exposure to our consolidated financial statements or liquidity as of march 31 2017  

historically fluctuations in interest rates have not had a significant effect on our operating results under our credit agreement outstanding balances bear interest at our election of a 025  to 075  above a certain base rate  425  at march 31 2017  or b 125  to 175  above the libor rate approximately 223  at march 31 2017  with the margin rate subject to the achievement of certain average liquidity levels changes in market rates may affect our future interest expense if there is an outstanding balance on our line of credit at march 31 2017  there were no outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement the 100 convertible notes pay interest semiannually at a fixed rate of 100 per annum and we expect that there will be no fluctuation related to the 100 convertible notes affecting our cash component of interest expense for additional details on our convertible notes see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we transact business in foreign currencies and are exposed to risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates accounts relating to foreign operations are translated into united states dollars using prevailing exchange rates at the relevant period end translation adjustments are included as a separate component of stockholders equity for the fiscal year ended march 31 2017  and 2016  our foreign currency translation adjustment loss was 91 million  and 74 million  respectively we recognized a foreign currency exchange transaction gain of 50 million  for fiscal year ended march 31 2017  and losses of 14 million  and 21 million million for the fiscal years ended march 31 2016  and 2015  respectively in interest and other net in our consolidated statements of operations 

balance sheet hedging activities 

we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with nonfunctional currency denominated cash balances and intercompany funding loans nonfunctional currency denominated accounts receivable and nonfunctional currency denominated accounts payable these transactions are not designated as hedging instruments and are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts is reported as either assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value are reported in interest and other net in our consolidated statements of operations we do not enter into derivative financial contracts for speculative or trading purposes at march 31 2017  we had 92 million  of forward contracts outstanding to buy foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars and 1775 million  of forward contracts outstanding to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars all of which have maturities of less than one year at march 31 2016  we had 24 million  of forward contracts outstanding to buy foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars and 545 million  of forward contracts outstanding to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars all of which have maturities of less than one year for the fiscal years ended march 31 2017  2016  and 2015  we recorded gains of 72 million  01 million  and 185 million  respectively related to foreign currency forward contracts in interest and other net on the consolidated statements of operations as of march 31 2017  and 2016  the fair value of these outstanding forward contracts was a loss of 04 million  and 01 million  respectively and is included in accrued and other current liabilities the fair value of these outstanding forward contracts is estimated based on the prevailing exchange rates of the various hedged currencies as of the end of the period 

our hedging programs are designed to reduce but do not entirely eliminate the effect of currency exchange rate movements we believe the counterparties to these foreign currency forward contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks and that the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risks there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations for the fiscal year ended march 31 2017  439  of our revenue was generated outside the united states using sensitivity analysis a hypothetical 10 increase in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would decrease revenues by 44  while a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would increase revenues by 44  in the opinion of management a substantial portion of this fluctuation would be offset by cost of goods sold and operating expenses incurred in local currency

we use a product investment review process to evaluate potential titles for investment to review existing titles in development and to assess titles after release to measure their performance in the market and the return on our investment we apply this process to all of our products whether internally or externally developed the product investment review process includes reviews of each project at various stages of development by our executive management team and the senior management of our publishing labels and includes coordination between our sales and marketing personnel before the launch of titles this disciplined approach to product investment is expected to enhance the competitiveness and profitability of our titles 

we develop our products using a combination of our internal development teams and external development resources acting under contract with us we typically select external developers based on their track record and expertise in developing products in the same category or genre one developer will generally produce the same game for multiple platforms and will also produce sequels to the original game we believe that selecting and using development resources in this manner allows us to leverage the particular expertise of our internal and external development resources which we believe increases the quality of our products

our marketing and promotional efforts are intended to maximize consumer interest in our titles promote brand name recognition of our franchises assist retailers and properly position package and merchandise our titles from time to time we also receive marketing support from hardware manufacturers in connection with their own promotional efforts 

we market titles by 

• implementing public relations campaigns using print and online advertising television radio spots and outdoor advertising we believe that we label and market our products in accordance with the applicable principles and guidelines of the entertainment software rating board or the esrb an independent selfregulatory body that assigns ratings and enforces advertising guidelines for the interactive software industry • satisfying certain shelf life and sales requirements under our agreements with hardware manufacturers in order to qualify for sonys greatest hits programs and microsofts platinum hits program in connection with these programs we receive manufacturing discounts from sony and microsoft • stimulating continued sales by reducing the wholesale prices of our products to retailers at various times during the life of a product price protection may occur at any time in a products life cycle but typically occurs three to nine months after a products initial launch in certain international markets we also provide volume rebates to stimulate continued product sales price protection sales returns and other allowances amounted to 645 million 501 million and 1381 million during the fiscal years ended march 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively • employing various other marketing methods designed to promote consumer awareness including social media instore promotions and pointofpurchase displays direct mail cooperative advertising attendance at trade shows as well as product sampling through demonstration software distributed via the internet or the digital online services 5 

as of march 31 2016 we had a sales and marketing staff of 355 people 

product procurement 

we procure products from suppliers principally using standard purchase orders based on our assessment of market demand we carry inventory quantities that we believe are necessary to provide rapid response to retailer orders we utilize electronic data interchange with many of our customers to enhance the efficiency of placing and shipping orders and receiving payments 

competition 

in our business we compete with 

• companies that range in size and cost structure from very small with limited resources to very large with greater financial marketing and technical personnel and other resources than ours including activision blizzard inc electronic arts inc and ubisoft entertainment sa • sony and microsoft for the sale of interactive entertainment software each of these competitors is a large developer and marketer of software for their own platforms and has the financial resources to withstand significant price competition and to implement extensive advertising campaigns • other software hardware entertainment and media for limited retail shelf space and promotional resources the competition is intense among an increasing number of newly introduced entertainment software titles and hardware for adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support • other forms of entertainment such as motion pictures television and audio social networking online computer programs mobile games and other forms of entertainment which may be less expensive or provide other advantages to consumers competition in the entertainment software industry is based on innovation features playability and product quality brand name recognition compatibility with popular platforms access to distribution channels price marketing and customer service our business is driven by hit titles which require increasing budgets for development and marketing competition for our titles is influenced by the timing of competitive product releases and the similarity of such products to our titles and may result in loss of shelf space or a reduction in sellthrough of our titles at retail stores 

trends and factors affecting our business 

product release schedule our financial results are affected by the timing of our product releases and the commercial success of those titles our grand theft auto products in particular have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue grand theft auto products contributed 545 of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2016 the timing of our grand theft auto releases varies significantly which in turn may affect our financial performance on a quarterly and annual basis 

economic environment and retailer performance we continue to monitor economic conditions that may unfavorably affect our businesses such as deteriorating consumer demand pricing pressure on our products credit quality of our receivables and foreign currency exchange rates our business is dependent upon a limited number of customers who account for a significant portion of our revenue our five largest customers accounted for 589 646 and 394 of net revenue during the fiscal years ended march 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively as of march 31 2016 and 2015 five customers comprised 739 and 639 of our gross accounts receivable respectively with our significant customers those that individually comprised more than 10 of our gross accounts receivable balance accounting for 641 and 545 of such balance at march 31 2016 and 2015 respectively we had three customers who accounted for 352 168 and 121 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2016 and three customers who 

accounted for 185 184 and 176 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2015 we did not have any additional customers that exceeded 10 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2016 and 2015 the economic environment has affected our customers in the past and may do so in the future bankruptcies or consolidations of our large retail customers could seriously hurt our business due to uncollectible accounts receivables and the concentration of purchasing power among the remaining large retailers certain of our large customers sell used copies of our games which may negatively affect our business by reducing demand for new copies of our games while the downloadable content that we now offer for certain of our titles may serve to reduce used game sales we expect used game sales to continue to adversely affect our business 

hardware platforms we derive most of our revenue from the sale of products made for video game platforms manufactured by thirdparties such as sonys ps4 and ps3 and microsofts xbox one and xbox 360 which comprised 826 of our net revenue by product platform for the fiscal year ended march 31 2016 the success of our business is dependent upon the consumer acceptance of these platforms and the continued growth in the installed base of these platforms when new hardware platforms are introduced demand for software based on older platforms typically declines which may negatively affect our business during the market transition to the new consoles accordingly our strategy is to focus our development efforts on a select number of the highest quality titles for these platforms while also expanding our offerings for emerging platforms such as tablets smartphones and online games 

online content and digital distribution the interactive entertainment software industry is delivering a growing amount of content through digital online delivery methods we provide a variety of online delivered products and offerings virtually all of our titles that are available through retailers as packaged goods products are also available through direct digital download via the internet from websites we own and others owned by thirdparties in addition we aim to drive ongoing engagement and recurrent consumer spending on our titles after their initial purchase by generating incremental revenues through downloadable offerings including addon content microtransactions and online play we also publish an expanding variety of titles for tablets and smartphones which are delivered to consumers through digital download via the internet note 17 to the consolidated financial statements segment and geographic information discloses that net revenue from digital online channels comprised 493 of our net revenue by distribution channel for the fiscal year ended march 31 2016 we expect online delivery of games and game offerings to become an increasing part of our business over the longterm 

international operations 

international sales are a significant part of our business for the fiscal years ended march 31 2016 2015 and 2014 474 425 and 535 respectively of our net revenue was earned outside the united states we are continuing to execute on our growth initiatives in asia where our strategy is to broaden the distribution of our existing products and expand our online gaming presence especially in china and south korea we are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade including increased credit risks tariffs and duties fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates shipping delays and international political regulatory and economic developments all of which can have a significant effect on our operating results see notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

segment and geographic information 

see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

employees 

as of march 31 2016 we had 2933 fulltime employees of which 1302 were employed outside of the united states none of our employees is subject to collective bargaining agreements we consider our relations with employees to be satisfactory 




 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties which may affect our future financial performance because of the risks and uncertainties described below as well as other factors affecting our operating results and financial condition past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and our business and financial performance could be harmed and the market value of our securities could decline 

risks relating to our business 

we are dependent on the future success of our grand theft auto products and we must continue to publish hit titles or sequels to such hit titles in order to compete successfully in our industry 

grand theft auto and certain of our other titles are hit products and have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue grand theft auto products contributed 545 of the companys net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2016 and the five bestselling franchises including grand theft auto  which may change year over year in the aggregate accounted for 937 of the companys net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2016 if we fail to continue to develop and sell new commercially successful hit titles or sequels to such hit titles or experience any delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of our hit titles or their sequels our revenue and profits may decrease substantially and we may incur losses in addition competition in our industry is intense and a relatively small number of hit titles account for a large portion of total revenue in our industry hit products offered by our competitors may take a larger share of consumer spending than we anticipate which could cause revenue generated from our products to fall below our expectations if our competitors develop more successful products or services at lower price points or based on payment models perceived as offering better value or if we do not continue to develop consistently high quality and wellreceived products and services our revenue and profitability may decline in addition both the online and mobile games marketplaces are characterized by frequent product introductions relatively low barriers to entry and new and evolving business methods technologies and platforms for development widespread consumer adoption of these new platforms for games and other technological advances in online or mobile game offerings could negatively affect our sales of console and traditional pc products before we have an opportunity to develop profitable businesses in such markets 

we are subject to product development risks which could result in delays and additional costs and we must adapt to changes in software technologies 

we depend on our internal development studios and thirdparty software developers to develop new interactive entertainment software within anticipated release schedules and cost projections the development cycle for new titles generally ranges from 12 months for annual sports releases to multiple years for certain of our topselling titles therefore our development costs can be substantial if we or our third party developers experience unanticipated development delays financial difficulties or additional costs we may not be able to release titles according to our schedule and at budgeted costs there can be no assurance that our products will be sufficiently successful so that we can recoup these costs or make a profit on these products 

additionally in order to stay competitive our internal development studios must anticipate and adapt to rapid technological changes affecting software development any inability to respond to technological advances and implement new technologies could render our products obsolete or less marketable 

the inability of our products to achieve significant market acceptance delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of our products may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

new products may not achieve significant market acceptance generate sufficient sales or be introduced in a timely manner to permit us to recover development manufacturing and marketing costs associated with these products the life cycle of a title generally involves a relatively high level of sales during the first few months after introduction followed by a rapid decline in sales because sales associated with an initial product launch generally constitute a high percentage of the total sales associated with the life of a product delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of one or more new products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results and cause our operating results to be materially different from our expectations 

our business is subject to our ability to develop commercially successful products for the current video game platforms 

we derive most of our revenue from the sale of products made for video game platforms manufactured by third parties such as sonys ps4 and ps3 and microsofts xbox one and xbox 360 which comprised 826 of the companys net revenue by product platform for the fiscal year ended march 31 2016 the success of our business is subject to the continued popularity of these platforms and our ability to develop commercially successful products for these platforms 

connectivity issues could affect our ability to sell and provide online services for our products and could affect our profitability 

we rely upon thirdparty digital delivery platforms such as microsofts xbox live sony entertainment network steam and other thirdparty service providers to provide connectivity from the consumer to our digital products and our online services connectivity issues could prevent customers from accessing this content and our ability to successfully market and sell our products could be adversely affected in addition we could experience similar issues related to services we host on our internal servers such issues also could affect our ability to provide online services and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

our business could be adversely affected if our consumer data protection measures are not seen as adequate or there are breaches of our security measures or unintended disclosures of our consumer data 

we are collecting and storing consumer information including personal information we take measures to protect our consumer data from unauthorized access or disclosure it is possible that our security controls over consumer data may not prevent the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information in addition due to the high profile nature of our products we may draw a disproportionately higher amount of attention and attempts to breach our security controls than companies with lower profile products a security breach that leads to disclosure of consumer account information including personally identifiable information could harm our reputation compel us to comply with disparate breach notification laws in various jurisdictions and otherwise subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue a resulting perception that our products or services do not adequately protect the privacy of personal information could result in a loss of current or potential consumers and business partners in addition if any of our business partners experience a security breach that leads to disclosure of consumer account information our reputation could be harmed resulting in loss of revenue 

in addition certain of our products are online enabled the ability of our products to offer online functionality and our ability to offer content through a video game platforms digital distribution channel is dependent upon the continued operation and security of such platforms online network these third 

party networks as well as our own internal systems and websites and the security measures related thereto may be breached as a result of thirdparty action including intentional misconduct by computer hackers employee error malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers data or our data including our intellectual property and other confidential business information or our information technology systems because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs we may lose business suffer irreparable damage to our reputation andor incur significant costs and expenses relating to the investigation and possible litigation of claims relating to such event 

the laws and regulations concerning data privacy and certain other aspects of our business are continually evolving failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business 

we are subject to certain privacy and data protection laws including those in the united states certain aspects of our activities are subject to the euus privacy shield and certain activities related to eu customers are registered with our uk data controller the us childrens online privacy protection act also regulates the collection use and disclosure of personal information from children under 13 years of age failure to comply with privacy laws data protection laws or age restrictions may increase our costs subject us to expensive and distracting government investigations and result in substantial fines 

privacy and data protection laws are rapidly changing and likely will continue to do so for the foreseeable future which could impact our approach to operating and marketing our games for example the court of justice of the european unions recent decision to invalidate the euus safe harbor regime that legitimized the transfer of certain personal data from the eu to the us was a material change to laws on data privacy applicable to our business the european commission and the us government have recently agreed to a new framework for transatlantic data flows known as the euus privacy shield which is intended to replace the safe harbor regime but the details of how this will operate in practice and the compliance implications for our business are not yet clear the us government including the federal trade commission and the department of commerce is continuing to review the need for greater regulation over the collection of personal information and information about consumer behavior on the internet and on mobile devices and the eu has proposed reforms to its existing data protection legal framework various government and consumer agencies worldwide have also called for new regulation and changes in industry practices 

player use of our games is subject to our privacy policy end user license agreements and terms of service if we fail to comply with our posted privacy policy eulas or terms of service or if we fail to comply with existing privacyrelated or data protection laws and regulations it could result in proceedings or litigation against us by governmental authorities or others which could result in fines or judgments against us damage our reputation impact our financial condition and harm our business if regulators the media or consumers raise any concerns about our privacy and data protection or consumer protection practices even if unfounded this could also result in fines or judgments against us damage our reputation negatively impact our financial condition and damage our business 

it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted or construed to apply to us in the united states and elsewhere that could restrict the interactive entertainment industry including player privacy advertising taxation content suitability copyright distribution and antitrust furthermore the growth and development of electronic commerce and virtual goods may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on companies such as ours conducting business through digital sales any such changes would require us to devote legal and other resources to address such regulation for example existing laws or new laws regarding the regulation of currency banking institutions and unclaimed property may be interpreted to cover virtual currency or virtual goods if that were to occur we may be required to seek licenses authorizations or approvals from relevant 

regulators the granting of which may be dependent on us meeting certain capital and other requirements and we may be subject to additional regulation and oversight all of which could significantly increase our operating costs changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws and regulations in the united states or elsewhere regarding these activities may lessen the growth of the interactive entertainment industry and impair our business financial condition and operating results 

security breaches involving the source code for our products or other sensitive and proprietary information could adversely affect our business 

we securely store the source code for our interactive entertainment software products as it is created a breach whether physical electronic or otherwise of the systems on which such source code and other sensitive data are stored could lead to damage or piracy of our software in addition certain parties with whom we do business are given access to our sensitive and proprietary information in order to provide services and support our team these third parties may misappropriate our information and engage in unauthorized use of it if we are subject to data security breaches we may have a loss in sales or increased costs arising from the restoration or implementation of additional security measures which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results any theft andor unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an event could adversely affect our competitive position reputation brand and future sales of our products our business could be subject to significant disruption and we could suffer monetary and other losses and reputational harm in the event of such incidents and claims 

we rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business any significant system or network disruption could negatively impact our business 

we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks some of which are within taketwo and some of which are managed andor hosted by thirdparty providers all information technology systems and networks are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources including but not limited to cyberattacks malicious software security breach energy blackouts natural disasters terrorism war and telecommunication failures we may also face sophisticated attacks referred to as advanced persistent threats which are cyberattacks aimed at compromising our intellectual property and other commerciallysensitive information such as the source code and game assets for our software or confidential customer or employee information which remain undetected for prolonged periods of time information technology system or network failure or security breach could negatively impact our business continuity operations and financial results these risks extend to the networks and ecommerce sites of console platform providers and other partners who sell and host our content online we may incur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions or security breaches 

our efforts to expand into new products and services may subject us to additional risks 

in recent years we have invested in emerging opportunities in interactive entertainment played on mobile platforms including tablets and smartphones and online platforms including social networks we have also grown our product offerings that are available through digital download we are actively investing to capitalize on these trends in order to diversify our product mix reduce our operating risks and increase our revenue there are risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed there is no assurance that we will be able to attract a sufficiently large number of customers or recover costs incurred for developing and marketing these new products or services external factors such as competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of any new products or services failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we depend on our key management and product development personnel 

our continued success will depend to a significant extent on our senior management team and our relationship with zelnickmedia corporation zelnickmedia our executive chairmanchief executive officer and president are partners of zelnickmedia we are also highly dependent on the expertise skills and knowledge of certain of our rockstar employees and other key creative personnel responsible for content creation and development of our grand theft auto titles and titles based on other brands we may not be able to continue to retain these personnel at current compensation levels or at all 

the loss of the services of our executive officers zelnickmedia our key rockstar employees or other key creative personnel could significantly harm our business in addition if one or more key employees were to join a competitor or form a competing company we may lose additional personnel experience material interruptions in product development delays in bringing products to market and difficulties in our relationships with licensors suppliers and customers which would significantly harm our business failure to continue to attract and retain other qualified management and creative personnel could adversely affect our business and prospects 

declines in consumer spending and other adverse changes in the economy could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

most of our products involve discretionary spending on the part of consumers we believe that consumer spending is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income this makes our products particularly sensitive to general economic conditions and economic cycles as consumers are generally more willing to make discretionary purchases including purchases of products like ours during periods in which favorable economic conditions prevail adverse economic conditions such as a prolonged us or international general economic downturn including periods of increased inflation unemployment levels tax rates interest rates energy prices or declining consumer confidence could also reduce consumer spending reduced consumer spending has and may in the future continue to result in reduced demand for our products and may also require increased selling and promotional expenses which has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results in addition during periods of relative economic weakness our consolidated credit risk reflecting our counterparty dealings with distributors customers capital providers and others may increase perhaps materially so furthermore uncertainty and adverse changes in the economy could also increase the risk of material losses on our investments increase costs associated with developing and publishing our products increase the cost and availability of sources of financing and increase our exposure to material losses from bad debts any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results if economic conditions worsen our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 

changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and in various other jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are required to estimate future taxes although we currently believe our tax estimates are reasonable the estimate process is inherently uncertain and such estimates are not binding on tax authorities further our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by a variety of factors including changes in the business including the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in tax elections and changes in applicable tax laws additionally tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities and developments in those audits could adversely affect our income tax provision should the ultimate tax liability exceed estimates our income tax provision and net income or loss could be adversely affected 

historically we recorded a valuation allowance against most of our us deferred tax assets we expect to provide a valuation allowance on future us tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability or until other significant positive evidence arises that suggest that these benefits are more likely than not to be realized further our tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities and developments in those audits could adversely affect our income tax provision should our ultimate tax liability exceed our estimates our income tax provision and net income or loss could be materially affected 

we earn a significant amount of our operating income and hold a significant portion of our cash outside the us any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions may result in higher effective tax rates for the company in addition there have been proposals to change us tax laws that would significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings although we cannot predict whether or in what form this proposed legislation will pass if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our income tax provision and financial condition 

we are also required to pay taxes other than income taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the us and foreign jurisdictions we are regularly under examination by tax authorities with respect to these nonincome taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations changes in our business or changes in applicable tax rules will not have an adverse effect on our net income or loss and financial condition 

unclaimed property audits by governmental authorities could adversely impact our operating results 

we are subject to unclaimed property escheat laws which require us to turn over to certain government authorities the property of others held by us that has been unclaimed for a specified period of time we are subject to audit by individual us states with regard to our escheatment practices the legislation and regulations related to unclaimed property matters tend to be complex and subject to varying interpretations by both government authorities and taxpayers although management believes that the positions we have taken are reasonable various taxing authorities may challenge certain of the positions we have taken which may also potentially result in additional liabilities for unclaimed property and interest in excess of accrued liabilities our positions are reviewed as events occur such as the availability of new information the lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations the measurement of additional estimated liability based on current calculations or the rendering of relevant court decisions an unfavorable resolution of assessments by a governmental authority could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows in future periods 

our quarterly operating results are dependent on the release of hit titles and are highly seasonal which may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate significantly 

we have experienced and may continue to experience wide fluctuations in quarterly operating results the release of a hit title typically leads to a high level of sales during the first few months after introduction followed by a rapid decline in sales in addition the interactive entertainment industry is highly seasonal with sales typically higher during the fourth calendar quarter due primarily to increased demand for games during the holiday season demand for and sales of titles in our nba 2k series are also seasonal in that they are typically released just prior to the start of the nba season if a key event or sports season to which our product release schedule is tied were to be delayed or cancelled our sales might also suffer disproportionately our failure or inability to produce hit titles or introduce products on a timely basis to meet seasonal fluctuations in demand could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results the uncertainties associated with software development manufacturing lead times production delays and the approval process for products by hardware manufacturers and other licensors make it difficult to predict the quarter in which our products will ship and therefore may cause us to fail to meet financial expectations 

price protection granted to our customers and returns of our published titles by our customers may adversely affect our operating results 

we are exposed to the risk of price protection and product returns with respect to our customers our distribution arrangements with customers generally do not give them the right to return titles to us or to cancel firm orders however we sometimes accept product returns from our distribution customers for stock balancing and negotiate accommodations for customers which include credits and returns when demand for specific products falls below expectations we grant price protection and accept returns in connection with our publishing arrangements and revenue is recognized after deducting estimated price protection and reserves for returns while we believe that we can reliably estimate future price protection and returns if price protection and return rates for our products exceed our reserves our revenue could decline which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

increased sales of used video game products could lower our sales 

certain of our larger customers sell used video games which are generally priced lower than new video games if our customers increase their sales of used video games it could negatively affect our sales of new video games and have an adverse influence on our business financial condition and operating results 

a limited number of customers account for a significant portion of our sales the loss of a principal customer or other significant business relationship could seriously hurt our business 

a substantial portion of our product sales are made to a limited number of customers sales to our five largest customers during the fiscal year ended march 31 2016 accounted for 589 of our net revenue with sony and microsoft each accounting for more than 100 of our net revenue during the fiscal year ended march 31 2016 our sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders without longterm agreements or other commitments and our customers may terminate their relationship with us at any time certain of our customers may decline to carry products containing mature content the loss of our relationships with principal customers or a decline in sales to principal customers including as a result of a product being rated ao age 18 and over could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results in addition if our customers are subject to pricing pressures due to deteriorating demand for our products competitive pressure or otherwise such customers may pass those pricing pressures through to us which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

furthermore our customers may also be placed into bankruptcy become insolvent or be liquidated due to economic downturns global contractions of credit or for other factors bankruptcies or consolidations of certain large retail customers could seriously hurt our business including as a result of uncollectible accounts receivable from such customers and the concentration of purchasing power among remaining large retailers in addition our results of operations may be adversely affected if certain of our customers who purchase on credit terms are no longer eligible to purchase on such terms due to their financial distress which may reduce the quantity of products they demand from us 

if our marketing and advertising efforts fail to resonate with consumers our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 

our products are marketed worldwide through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs such as television and online advertising social media advertising print advertising retail merchandising website development and event sponsorship our ability to sell our products and services is dependent in part on the success of these programs if the marketing for our products and services fails to resonate with consumers particularly during the holiday season or other key selling periods or if 

advertising rates or other media placement costs increase these factors could have a material adverse influence on our business financial condition and operating results 

the interactive entertainment software industry is highly competitive 

we compete for both licenses to properties and the sale of interactive entertainment software with sony and microsoft each of which is a large developer and marketer of software for its own platforms we also compete with game publishers such as activision blizzard inc and electronic arts inc and ubisoft entertainment sa as our business is dependent upon our ability to develop hit titles which require increasing budgets for development and marketing the availability of significant financial resources has become a major competitive factor in developing and marketing software games some of our competitors have greater financial technical personnel and other resources than we do and are able to finance larger budgets for development and marketing and make higher offers to licensors and developers for commercially desirable properties our titles also compete with other forms of entertainment such as social media and casual games in addition to motion pictures television and audio and video products featuring similar themes online computer programs and other entertainment which may be less expensive or provide other advantages to consumers 

a number of software publishers who compete with us have developed and commercialized or are currently developing online games for use by consumers over the internet if technological advances significantly increase the availability of online games and if consumer acceptance of online gaming grows substantially it could result in a decline in our platformbased software sales and negatively affect sales of such products 

increased competition for limited shelf space and promotional support from retailers could affect the success of our business and require us to incur greater expenses to market our titles 

retailers have limited shelf space and promotional resources and competition is intense among newly introduced interactive entertainment software titles for adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support competition for retail shelf space is expected to continue to increase which may require us to increase our marketing expenditures to maintain desirable sales levels of our titles competitors with more extensive lines and more popular titles may have greater bargaining power with retailers accordingly we may not be able or we may have to pay more than our competitors to achieve similar levels of promotional support and shelf space 

our business is partly dependent on our ability to enter into successful software development arrangements with thirdparties 

our success depends on our ability to continually identify and develop new titles on a timely basis we rely on thirdparty software developers for the development of some of our titles quality thirdparty developers are continually in high demand software developers who have developed titles for us in the past may not be available to develop software for us in the future due to the limited number of thirdparty software developers and the limited control that we exercise over them these developers may not be able to complete titles for us on a timely basis or within acceptable quality standards if at all we have entered into agreements with thirdparties to acquire the rights to publish and distribute interactive entertainment software as well as to use licensed intellectual properties in our titles these agreements typically require us to make development payments pay royalties and satisfy other conditions our development payments may not be sufficient to permit developers to develop new software successfully which could result in material delays and significantly increase our costs to bring particular products to market software development costs promotion and marketing expenses and royalties payable to software developers and thirdparty licensors have increased significantly in recent years and reduce potential profits derived from sales of our software future sales of our titles may not be sufficient to recover development payments and advances to software developers and licensors and we may not have adequate financial and other 

resources to satisfy our contractual commitments to such developers if we fail to satisfy our obligations under agreements with thirdparty developers and licensors the agreements may be terminated or modified in ways that are burdensome to us and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we cannot publish our titles without the approval of hardware licensors that are also our competitors 

we are required to obtain licenses from sony and microsoft which are also our competitors to develop and publish titles for their respective hardware platforms our existing platform licenses require that we obtain approval for the publication of new titles on a titlebytitle basis as a result the number of titles we are able to publish for these hardware platforms our ability to manage the timing of the release of these titles and accordingly our net revenue from titles for these hardware platforms may be limited if a licensor chooses not to renew or extend our license agreement at the end of its current term or if a licensor were to terminate our license for any reason or does not approve one or more of our titles we may be unable to publish that title as well as additional titles for that licensors platform termination of any such agreements or disapproval of titles could seriously hurt our business and prospects we may be unable to continue to enter into license agreements for certain current generation platforms on satisfactory terms or at all failure to enter into any such agreement could also seriously hurt our business 

we rely on a limited number of channel partners some of whom influence the fee structures for online distribution of our games on their platforms 

we rely on a limited number of channel partners some of whom have retained the right to change the fee structures for online distribution of both paid content and free content including patches and corrections that we license to them for distribution on their platforms such channel partners ability to set or influence royalty rates may increase costs which could negatively affect our operating margins we may be unable to distribute our content in a costeffective or profitable manner through such distribution channel which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

outside of fee arrangements our agreements with our channel partners sometimes give them significant control over other aspects of the distribution of our products and services that we develop for their platform if our channel partners establish terms that restrict our offerings through their channels or significantly impact the financial terms on which these products or services are offered to our customers we may be unable to distribute our product offerings through them or be forced to do so on a materially worse financial or business terms 

we may not be able to adequately adjust our cost structure in a timely fashion in response to a sudden decrease in demand 

in the event of a significant decline in revenue we may not be able to dispose of facilities reduce personnel or make other changes to our cost structure without disruption to our operations or without significant termination and exit costs management may not be able to implement such actions in a timely manner if at all to offset an immediate shortfall in revenue and profit moreover reducing costs may impair our ability to produce and develop software titles at sufficient levels in the future 

the increasing importance of digital sales to our business exposes us to the risks of that business model including greater competition 

the proportion of our revenues derived from digital content delivery as compared to traditional retail sales may continue to increase the increased importance of digital content delivery in our industry increases our potential competition as the minimum capital needed to produce and publish a digitally delivered game is significantly less than that needed to produce and publish one that is purchased through retail distribution and is played on a game console this will also require us to dedicate capital to 

developing and implementing alternative marketing strategies which we may not do successfully if either occurs we may be unable to effectively market and distribute our products which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results in addition a continuing shift to digital delivery could result in a deprioritization of our products by traditional retailers the increasing importance of digital sales to our business could also result in increasing issues with our digital distribution process including difficulties our distributors have with collecting from consumers and any associated rebates we would owe 

we use open source software in connection with certain of our games and services which may pose particular risks to our proprietary software products and services in a manner that could have a negative impact on our business 

we use open source software in connection with certain of our games and the services we offer some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software or make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost the terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by courts and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our use of the open source software were it determined that our use was not in compliance with a particular license we may be required to release our proprietary source code pay damages for breach of contract reengineer our games discontinue distribution in the event reengineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our game development efforts any of which could harm our business 

we depend on servers and internet bandwidth to operate our games and digital services with online features if we were to lose server capacity or lack sufficient internet bandwidth for any reason our business could suffer 

we rely on data servers including those owned or controlled by third parties to enable our customers to download our games and other downloadable content and to operate our online games and other products with online functionality events such as limited hardware failure any broadbased catastrophic server malfunction a significant intrusion by hackers that circumvents security measures or a failure of disaster recovery services would likely interrupt the functionality of our games with online services and could result in a loss of sales for games and related services an extended interruption of service could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we expect a significant portion of our games to be online enabled in the future and therefore we must project our future server needs and make advance purchases of servers or server capacity to accommodate expected business demands if we underestimate the amount of server capacity our business requires or if our business were to grow more quickly than expected our consumers may experience service problems such as slow or interrupted gaming access insufficient server capacity may result in decreased sales a loss of our consumer base and adverse consequences to our reputation conversely if we overestimate the amount of server capacity required by our business we may incur additional operating costs 

because of the potential importance of our online business to our revenues and results of operations our ability to access adequate internet bandwidth and online computational resources to support our business is critical if the price of either such resource increases we may not be able to increase our prices or subscriber levels to compensate for such costs which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we submit our products for rating by the entertainment software rating board esrb in the united states and other voluntary or government ratings organizations in foreign countries failure to obtain a target rating for certain of our products could negatively affect our ability to distribute and sell those games as could the rerating of a game for any reason 

we voluntarily submit our game products to the esrb a usbased nonprofit and independent ratings organization the esrb system provides consumers with information about game content using a rating symbol that generally suggests the appropriate player age group and specific content descriptors such as graphic violence profanity or sexually explicit material the esrb may impose significant penalties on game publishers for violations of its rules related to rating or marketing games including revocation of a rating or monetary fines other countries require voluntary or government backed ratings as prerequisites for product sales in some instances we may have to modify our products in order to market them under the target rating which could delay or disrupt the release of our products in addition some of our titles may not be sold at all or without extensive edits in certain countries such as germany 

in the united states if the esrb rates a game as ao age 18 and older platform licensors may not certify the game and retailers may refuse to sell it in addition some consumers have reacted to reratings or controversial game content by refusing to purchase such games demanding refunds for games that they had already purchased and refraining from buying other games published by us many of our rockstar titles and certain of our 2k titles have been rated m age 17 and older by the esrb if we are unable to obtain m ratings and instead receive ao ratings on future versions of those or similar titles as a result of changes in the esrbs ratings standards or for other reasons including the adoption of legislation in this area our business and prospects could be negatively affected if any of our games are rerated by the esrb or other foreign based ratings organizations we could be exposed to litigation administrative fines and penalties and other potential liabilities and our operating results and financial condition could be significantly affected 

we have implemented processes to comply with the requirements of the esrb and other ratings organizations and properly display the designated rating symbols and content descriptions nonetheless these processes are subject to human error circumvention overriding and reasonable resource constraints if a video game we published were found to contain undisclosed pertinent content the esrb could rerate a game retailers could refuse to sell it and demand that we accept the return of any unsold copies or returns from customers and consumers could refuse to buy it or demand that we refund their money this could have a material negative affect on our operating results and financial condition in addition we may be exposed to litigation administrative fines and penalties and our reputation could be harmed which could affect sales of other video games we sell if any of these consequences were to occur our business and financial performance could be significantly harmed 

content policies adopted by retailers consumer opposition and litigation could negatively affect sales of our products 

retailers may decline to sell interactive entertainment software containing what they judge to be graphic violence or sexually explicit material or other content that they deem inappropriate for their businesses if retailers decline to sell our products based upon their opinion that they contain objectionable themes graphic violence or sexually explicit material or other generally objectionable content or if any of our previously m rated series products are rated ao we might be required to significantly change or discontinue particular titles or series which in the case of our bestselling grand theft auto titles could seriously affect our business consumer advocacy groups have opposed sales of interactive entertainment software containing objectionable themes violence or sexual material or other objectionable content by pressing for legislation in these areas and by engaging in public demonstrations and media campaigns additionally although lawsuits seeking damages for injuries allegedly suffered by thirdparties as a result of video games have generally been unsuccessful in the courts claims of this kind have been asserted against us from time to time and may be asserted and be successful in the future 

our results of operations or reputation may be harmed as a result of offensive consumercreated content 

we are subject to risks associated with the collaborative online features in our games which allow consumers to post narrative comments in real time that are visible to other consumers from time to time objectionable and offensive consumer content may be posted to a gaming or other site with online chat features or game forums which allow consumers to post comments we may be subject to lawsuits governmental regulation or restrictions and consumer backlash including decreased sales and harmed reputation as a result of consumers posting offensive content we may also be subject to consumer backlash from comments made in response to postings we make on social media sites such as facebook youtube and twitter 

we are subject to risks and uncertainties of international trade including fluctuations in the values of local foreign currencies against the dollar 

sales in international markets primarily in europe have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2016 474 of our net revenue was earned outside the united states we are continuing to execute on our growth initiatives in asia where our strategy is to broaden the distribution of our existing products and expand our online gaming presence especially in china and south korea we are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade including increased credit risks tariffs and duties fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates shipping delays and international political regulatory and economic developments all of which can have a significant influence on our operating results many of our international sales are made in local currencies which could fluctuate against the dollar while we may use forward exchange contracts to a limited extent to seek to mitigate foreign currency risk our operating results could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations 

we face risks from our international operations 

we are subject to certain risks because of our international operations particularly as we continue to grow our business and presence in asia latin america and other parts of the world changes to and compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations may increase our cost of doing business and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals could harm our international and domestic sales trade legislation in either the united states or other countries such as a change in the current tariff structures importexport compliance laws or other trade laws or policies could adversely affect our ability to sell or to distribute in international markets we incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our international operations and could become subject to legal penalties in foreign countries if we do not comply with local laws and regulations which may be substantially different from those in the united states in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it may be common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by united states laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and by local laws such as laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations including those based in or from countries where practices which violate such laws may be customary will not take actions in violation of our policies any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could have a material adverse effect on our business 

if we are unable to protect the intellectual property relating to our software the commercial value of our products will be adversely affected and our competitive position could be harmed 

we develop proprietary software and have obtained the rights to publish and distribute software developed by thirdparties we attempt to protect our software and production techniques under patent copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as through contractual restrictions on disclosure copying and distribution our software is susceptible to piracy and unauthorized copying unauthorized thirdparties 

may be able to copy or to reverse engineer our software to obtain and use programming or production techniques that we regard as proprietary well organized piracy operations have also proliferated in recent years resulting in the ability to download pirated copies of our software over the internet although we attempt to incorporate protective measures into our software piracy of our products could negatively affect our future profitability 

if we infringe on or are alleged to infringe on the intellectual property rights of thirdparties our business could be adversely affected 

as our industry grows we may be subject to an increasing amount of litigation that is common in the software industry based on allegations of infringement or other alleged violations of patent copyright andor trademarks in addition we believe that interactive entertainment software will increasingly become the subject of claims that such software infringes on the intellectual property rights of others with both the growth of online functionality and advances in technology game content and software graphics as games become more realistic from time to time we receive notices from thirdparties or are named in lawsuits by thirdparties alleging infringement of their proprietary rights although we believe that our software and technologies and the software and technologies of thirdparty developers and publishers with whom we have contractual relations do not and will not infringe or violate proprietary rights of others it is possible that infringement of proprietary rights of others may occur any claims of infringement with or without merit could be time consuming costly and difficult to defend moreover intellectual property litigation or claims could require us to discontinue the distribution of products obtain a license or redesign our products which could result in additional substantial costs and material delays 

our software is susceptible to errors which can harm our financial results and reputation 

the technological advancements of new hardware platforms result in the development of more complex software products as software products become more complex the risk of undetected errors in new products increases we may need to produce and distribute patches in order to repair such errors which could be costly and may distract our developers from working on new products if despite testing errors are found in new products or releases after shipments have been made we could experience a loss of or delay in timely market acceptance product returns loss of revenue increases in costs relating to the repair of such errors and damage to our reputation 

if we acquire or invest in other businesses intellectual properties or other assets we may be unable to integrate them with our business our financial performance may be impaired andor we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for such transactions 

if appropriate opportunities present themselves we may acquire or make investments in businesses intellectual properties and other assets that we believe are strategic we may not be able to identify negotiate or finance any future acquisition or investment successfully even if we do succeed in acquiring or investing in a business intellectual property or other asset such acquisitions and investments involve a number of risks including 

• retaining key employees and maintaining the key business and customer relationships of the businesses we acquire • cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from an acquired company or business into our organization • the possibility that the combined company would not achieve the expected benefits including any anticipated operating and product synergies of the acquisition as quickly as anticipated or that the costs of or operational difficulties arising from an acquisition would be greater than anticipated 20 

• significant acquisitionrelated accounting adjustments particularly relating to an acquired companys deferred revenue that may cause reported revenue and profits of the combined company to be lower than the sum of their standalone revenue and profits • significant accounting charges resulting from the completion and integration of a sizeable acquisition and increased capital expenditures including potential impairment charges incurred to write down the carrying amount of intangible assets generated as a result of an acquisition • the possibility that we will not discover important facts during due diligence that could have a material adverse effect on the value of the businesses we acquire including the possibility that a change of control of a company we acquire triggers a termination of contractual or intellectual property rights important to the operation of its business • the need to integrate an acquired companys accounting management information human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management and timely reporting and the need to implement or remediate controls procedures and policies appropriate for a public company in an acquired company that prior to the acquisition lacked these controls procedures and policies • litigation or other claims in connection with or inheritance of claims or litigation risks as a result of an acquisition including claims from terminated employees customers or other thirdparties and • to the extent that we engage in strategic transactions outside of the united states we face additional risks including risks related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages currency risks and the particular economic political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries future acquisitions and investments could also involve the issuance of our equity and equitylinked securities potentially diluting our existing stockholders the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses writeoffs of goodwill intangibles or acquired inprocess technology or other increased cash and noncash expenses such as stockbased compensation any of the foregoing factors could harm our financial condition or prevent us from achieving improvements in our financial condition and operating performance that could have otherwise been achieved by us on a standalone basis our stockholders may not have the opportunity to review vote on or evaluate future acquisitions or investments 

our ability to acquire and maintain licenses to intellectual property especially for sports titles affects our revenue and profitability competition for these licenses may make them more expensive and increase our costs 

certain of our products are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others for example certain of our 2k products include rights licensed from major sports leagues and players associations similarly some of our other titles are based on licenses of popular entertainment products competition for these licenses is intense if we are unable to maintain these licenses or obtain additional licenses on reasonable economic terms or with significant commercial value our revenue and profitability could decline significantly competition for these licenses may also increase the advances guarantees and royalties that we must pay to the licensor which could significantly increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability in addition on certain intellectual property licenses we are subject to guaranteed minimum payments royalties or standards of performance and may not be able to terminate these agreements prior to their stated expiration if such licensed products do not generate revenues in excess of such minimum guarantees our profitability will be adversely affected 

we are subject to contractual covenants which place certain limitations on how we manage our business  

our second amended and restated credit agreement as amended the credit agreement and the indentures governing our 175 convertible notes due 2016 in november 2011  the 175 convertible 

notes and 100 convertible notes due 2018 in june 2013 the 100 convertible notes and together with the 175 convertible notes the convertible notes may limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt paying dividends repurchasing shares and acquiring or disposing of assets or businesses in addition we have granted a security interest in connection with certain compensatory arrangements which limits our ability to incur senior debt in excess of certain amounts accordingly we may be restricted from taking actions that management believes would be desirable and in the best interests of us and our stockholders our credit agreement and the indentures also require us to satisfy specified financial and nonfinancial covenants a breach of any of the covenants contained in our credit agreement could result in an event of default under the agreement and under the indentures governing our convertible notes and would allow our lenders and noteholders to pursue various remedies including accelerating the repayment of any outstanding indebtedness 

our business and products are subject to potential legislation the adoption of such proposed legislation could limit the retail market for our products 

several proposals have been made for federal legislation to regulate our industry such proposals seek to prohibit the sale of products containing certain content included in some of our games if any such proposals are enacted into law it may limit the potential market for some of our games in the united states and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results other countries such as germany have adopted laws regulating content both in packaged games and those transmitted over the internet that are stricter than current united states laws in the united states proposals have also been made by numerous state legislators to regulate and prohibit the sale of interactive entertainment software products containing certain types of violent or sexual content to under 17 or 18 audiences such as the state of californias ultraviolent video games law that sought to ban the sale or rental of violent video games to minors while such legislation to date has been enjoined by industry and retail groups or been found unconstitutional the adoption into law of such legislation in federal andor in state jurisdictions in which we do significant business could severely limit the retail market for some of our games 

we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill becomes impaired 

we are required under us generally accepted accounting principles to review our goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating a requirement to reevaluate whether our goodwill continues to be recoverable include a significant decline in stock price and market capitalization slower growth rates in our industry or other materially adverse events we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill is determined this may adversely affect our operating results 

our reported financial results could be adversely affected by the application of existing or future accounting standards to our business as it evolves 

our reported financial results are affected by the accounting policies promulgated by the sec and national accounting standards bodies and the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies for example standards regarding revenue recognition have and could further significantly affect the way we account for revenue related to our products and services we expect that an increasing number of our games will be onlineenabled in the future and that we could be required to recognize the related revenues over a period of time rather than at the time of sale further as we increase our downloadable content and add new features to our online services our estimate of the service period may change and we could be required to recognize revenues and defer related costs over a shorter or longer period of time than we initially allocated as we enhance expand and diversify our business and product offerings the application of existing or future financial accounting standards particularly those 

relating to the way we account for revenue could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results although not necessarily on our cash flows 

risks relating to our common stock 

for purposes of this section risks relating to our common stock references to the company we our and us refer only to taketwo interactive software inc and not to its subsidiaries 

additional issuances or sales of equity securities by us would dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

we may issue equity or equitybased securities such as our convertible notes in the future in connection with acquisitions or strategic transactions to adjust our ratio of debt to equity including through repayment of outstanding debt to fund expansion of our operations or for other purposes to the extent we issue additional equity securities including upon conversion of our outstanding convertible notes the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders would be reduced the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect its price the sale or the availability for sale of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause the price of our common stock to decline the issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of our convertible notes could also adversely affect the price of our common stock 

there is no guarantee that we will do additional share repurchases in the future 

the share repurchase program authorized by the board of directors which authorized the repurchase of up to 14217683 shares of our common stock and had 9046353 shares available for repurchase as of march 31 2016 does not obligate the company to make any purchases at any specific time or situation discontinuing repurchases could adversely affect the price of the companys common stock the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time for any reason 

our stock price has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly 

the market price of our common stock historically has been and we expect will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us including those discussed in the risk factors in this section as well as others not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material to changes in securities analysts earnings estimates or ratings to our results or future financial guidance falling below our expectations and analysts and investors expectations to factors affecting the computer software entertainment media or electronics industries or to national or international economic conditions 

stock markets in general have experienced over the years and continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected market prices for companies such as ours and that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the affected companies these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock regardless of our operating performance 

delaware law our charter documents and provisions of our debt agreements may impede or discourage a takeover which could cause the market price of our shares to decline 

we are a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a thirdparty to acquire control of us even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders our board of directors has the power without stockholder approval to adopt a stockholder rights plan andor to designate the terms of one or more series of preferred stock and issue shares of preferred stock in addition we may under certain circumstances involving a change of control be obligated to repurchase all or a portion of our convertible notes and any 

potential acquirer would be required to assume our obligations related to any outstanding convertible notes we or any possible acquirer may not have available financial resources necessary to repurchase those notes the ability of our board of directors to create and issue a new series of preferred stock and certain provisions of delaware law our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the indenture governing our notes could impede a merger takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock which under certain circumstances could reduce the market price of our common stock and the value of any outstanding notes 

our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future years taxes could be substantially limited if we experience an ownership change as defined in the internal revenue code 

section 382 of the internal revenue code contains rules that limit the ability of a company to use its net operating loss carryforwards in years after an ownership change which is generally defined as any change in ownership of more than 50 of its stock over a threeyear testing period these rules generally operate by focusing on ownership changes among stockholders owning directly or indirectly 5 or more of the stock of a company andor any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of stock by the company if as a result of future transactions involving our common stock including purchases or sales of stock by 5 stockholders we undergo cumulative ownership changes which exceed 50 over the testing period our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards would be subject to additional limitations under section 382 

generally if an ownership change occurs the annual taxable income limitation on the use of net operating loss carryforwards is equal to the product of the applicable longterm tax exempt rate and the value of the companys stock immediately before the ownership change depending on the resulting limitation a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards could expire before we would be able to use them 

our inability to fully utilize our net operating losses to offset taxable income generated in the future could have a material and negative affect on our future financial position and results of operations

trends and factors affecting our business 

product release schedule our financial results are affected by the timing of our product releases and the commercial success of those titles our grand theft auto products in particular have historically accounted for a significant portion of our revenue sales of grand theft auto products generated 545 of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2016 the timing of our grand theft auto product releases may affect our financial performance on a quarterly and annual basis 

economic environment and retailer performance we continue to monitor economic conditions that may unfavorably affect our businesses such as deteriorating consumer demand pricing pressure on our products credit quality of our receivables and foreign currency exchange rates our business is dependent upon a limited number of customers that account for a significant portion of our revenue our five largest customers accounted for 589 646 and 394 of net revenue during the fiscal years ended march 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively as of march 31 2016 and 2015 our five largest customers comprised 739 and 639 of our gross accounts receivable respectively with our significant customers those that individually comprised more than 10 of our gross accounts receivable balance accounting for 641 and 545 of such balance at march 31 2016 and 2015 respectively we had three customers who accounted for 352 168 and 121 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2016 and three customers who accounted for 185 184 and 176 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2015 we did not have any additional customers that exceeded 10 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2016 and 2015 the economic environment has affected our customers in the past and may do so in the future bankruptcies or consolidations of our large retail customers could seriously hurt our business due to uncollectible accounts receivables and the concentration of purchasing power among the remaining large retailers certain of our large customers sell used copies of our games which may negatively affect our business by reducing demand for new copies of our games while the downloadable content that we now offer for certain of our titles may serve to reduce used game sales we expect used game sales to continue to adversely affect our business 

hardware platforms we derive most of our revenue from the sale of products made for video game consoles manufactured by thirdparties such as sonys ps4 and ps3 and microsofts xbox one and xbox 360 which comprised 826 of our net revenue by product platform for the fiscal year ended march 31 2016 the success of our business is dependent upon the consumer acceptance of these consoles and continued growth in their installed base when new hardware platforms are introduced demand for software used on older platforms typically declines which may negatively affect our business during the market transition to the new consoles we continually monitor console hardware sales we manage our product delivery on each current and future platform in a manner we believe to be most effective to maximize our revenue opportunities and achieve the desired return on our investments in product development accordingly our strategy is to focus our development efforts on a select number of the 

highest quality titles for these platforms while also expanding our offerings for emerging platforms such as tablets smartphones and online games 

online content and digital distribution the interactive entertainment software industry is delivering a growing amount of content through digital online delivery methods we provide a variety of online delivered products and offerings most of our titles that are available through retailers as packaged goods products are also available through direct digital download from websites we own and others owned by thirdparties in addition we aim to drive ongoing engagement and incremental revenue from recurrent consumer spending on our titles after their initial purchase through downloadable offerings including addon content microtransactions and online play we also publish an expanding variety of titles for tablets and smartphones which are delivered to consumers through digital download via the internet note 17 to the consolidated financial statements segment and geographic information discloses that net revenue from digital online channels comprised 493 of our net revenue by distribution channel for the fiscal year ended march 31 2016 we expect online delivery of games and game offerings to continue to grow and to become an increasing part of our business over the longterm 

product releases 

we released the following key titles in fiscal year 2016 



product pipeline 

we have announced the following key titles to date this list does not represent all titles currently in development 



fiscal 2016 financial summary 

our net revenue for fiscal year ended march 31 2016 was led by titles from a variety of our top franchises primarily grand theft auto  nba 2k and wwe 2k our net revenue increased to 14137 million an increase of 3308 million or 305 compared to the fiscal year ended march 31 2015 

for the fiscal year ended march 31 2016 our net loss was 83 million as compared to 2795 million in the prior year diluted loss per share for the fiscal year ended march 31 2016 was 010 as compared to 348 for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015 our operating loss for the fiscal year ended march 31 2016 decreased compared to the fiscal year ended march 31 2015 due primarily to higher revenues from our grand theft auto franchise and higher gross profit due primarily to lower internal royalties as a percentage of revenue due to the timing of when internal royalties are earned the increase in gross profit was partially offset by 713 million in business reorganization expenses 

at march 31 2016 we had 7987 million of cash and cash equivalents compared to 9111 million at march 31 2015 the decrease in cash and cash equivalents from march 31 2015 was due primarily to cash used in investing and financing activities partially offset by cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing and financing activities related to purchases of shortterm investments purchases of fixed assets the repurchase of common stock and net share settlements of stockbased awards which were slightly offset by the proceeds received from the sale and maturities of our availableforsale securities net cash provided by operations was due primarily to cash generated from the sale of grand theft auto v  nba 2k16  wwe 2k16  and virtual currency partially offset by investments in software development and licenses and the funding of internal royalty payments 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we base our estimates assumptions and judgments on historical experience current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared on a regular basis management reviews the accounting policies assumptions estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are fairly presented in accordance with us gaap however because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 

we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our financial results and they require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the effect and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue on the sales of software products upon the transfer of title and risk of loss to our customers accordingly we recognize revenue for software titles when there is 1 persuasive evidence that an arrangement with the customer exists which is generally based on a customer purchase order 2 the product is delivered 3 the selling price is fixed or determinable and 4 collection of the customer receivable is deemed probable certain products are sold to customers with a street date  ie the earliest date these products may be sold by retailers for these products we recognize revenue on the later of the street date or the sale date in addition some of our software products are sold as full game digital downloads and digital addon content for which the consumer takes possession of the digital content for a fee revenue from product downloads is generally recognized when the download is made available assuming all other recognition criteria are met 

in providing credit terms to our customers our payment arrangements typically provide net 30 and 60 day terms advances received for licensing and exclusivity arrangements are reported on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred revenue until we meet our performance obligations at which point we recognize the revenue 

for some of our software products we enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which we may provide a combination of full game software online multiplayer functionality and related postcontract 

customer support pcs which generally includes additional free unspecified addon content updates maintenance and online support services for these arrangements we evaluate the significance of the pcs at the time each game is released based on the guidance in accounting standards codification 985605 software—revenue recognition asc 985605 to determine if the pcs rises to the level of a separate deliverable we monitor our initial assessments on an ongoing basis and consider any changes that may arise in conjunction with our evaluation we consider such factors as the significance of the development effort the nature of online features the extent of anticipated marketing focus on online features the significance of the online features to the consumers anticipated overall gameplay experience and the significance and length of time of our post sale obligations to consumers determining whether pcs is significant for a particular game is subjective and requires managements judgment 

when a software arrangement includes multiple elements the arrangement consideration is allocated to each revenue element based on its relative fair value based on the vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for each element when vsoe of fair value does not exist for all of the elements in the arrangement asc 985605 requires either the use of the residual method or the deferral of revenue until the earlier point at which vsoe of fair value exists for any undelivered element or until only one undelivered element remains for arrangements that require the deferral of revenue the cost of goods sold is deferred and recognized as the related net revenue is recognized deferred cost of goods sold includes product costs and licenses we do not have vsoe for our pcs obligations and in those arrangements where pcs obligations have been determined to be significant we recognize revenue from the sale of software products over the period we expect to offer the pcs to the consumer estimated service period we also do not have vsoe for our online multiplayer functionality however it is generally delivered at the same time with the full game software determining the estimated service period is subjective and requires managements judgment therefore the estimated service period may change in the future the estimated service periods of our current games with online functionality and related pcs are generally twelve to thirtysix months 

when our software products provide insignificant pcs at no additional cost to the consumer we recognize revenue when the four primary revenue recognition criteria described above have been met for all other deliverables in the arrangement and in those situations we estimate and accrue the future costs of providing those services when software products provide pcs determined to be significant and as we are unable to establish vsoe for that deliverable we defer all of the softwarerelated revenues and the related cost of goods sold and recognize the softwarerelated revenues and the related cost of goods sold ratably over the estimated service period of the title assuming all other recognition criteria are met 

certain of our games provide consumers with the option to purchase virtual currency to use in the game to acquire virtual goods we currently recognize revenue from the sale of virtual currency using the gamebased model ratably over the estimated remaining life of the game 

as part of our ongoing assessment of estimated service periods during the three months ended march 31 2016 we changed grand theft auto vs estimated service period from 24 to 36 months the change in estimate resulted in a decrease in net revenues of 402 million and income from operations of 358 million to our fiscal 2016 financial results we expect this change in estimated service period to have a material impact to our fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 financial results 

revenue is recognized after deducting estimated price protection reserves for returns and other allowances in circumstances when we do not have a reliable basis to estimate price protection returns and other allowances or are unable to determine that collection of a receivable is probable we defer the revenue until such time as we can reliably estimate any related returns and allowances and determine that collection of the receivable is probable 

price protection and allowances for returns 

we grant price protection and accept returns in connection with our publishing arrangements following reductions in the price of our products we grant price protection to permit customers to take credits against amounts they owe us with respect to merchandise unsold by them our customers must satisfy certain conditions to entitle them to receive price protection or return products including compliance with applicable payment terms and confirmation of field inventory levels 

generally our distribution arrangements with customers do not give them the right to return titles or to cancel firm orders however we occasionally accept returns from our customers for stock balancing and make accommodations to customers which include credits and returns when demand for specific titles falls below expectations 

we make estimates of future price protection and product returns related to current period product revenue we estimate the amount of future price protection and returns for published titles based upon among other factors historical experience and performance of the titles in similar genres historical performance of the hardware platform customer inventory levels analysis of sellthrough rates sales force and retail customer feedback industry pricing market conditions and changes in demand and acceptance of our products by consumers 

significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing price protection and the allowance for returns in any accounting period we believe we can make reliable estimates of price protection and returns however actual results may differ from initial estimates as a result of changes in circumstances market conditions and assumptions adjustments to estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 

software development costs and licenses 

capitalized software development costs include direct costs incurred for internally developed titles and payments made to thirdparty software developers under development agreements 

we capitalize internal software development costs including stockbased compensation specifically identifiable employee payroll expense and incentive compensation costs related to the completion and release of titles thirdparty production and other content costs subsequent to establishing technological feasibility of a software title technological feasibility of a product includes the completion of both technical design documentation and game design documentation significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of when technological feasibility is established for products where proven technology exists this may occur early in the development cycle technological feasibility is evaluated on a product by product basis 

we enter into agreements with thirdparty developers that require us to make payments for game development and production services in exchange for our payments we receive the exclusive publishing and distribution rights to the finished game title as well as in some cases the underlying intellectual property rights such agreements typically allow us to fully recover these payments to the developers at an agreed upon royalty rate earned on the subsequent sales of such software net of any agreed upon costs prior to establishing technological feasibility of a product we record any costs incurred by thirdparty developers as research and development expenses subsequent to establishing technological feasibility of a product we capitalize all development and production service payments to thirdparty developers as software development costs and licenses we typically enter into agreements with thirdparty developers after completing the technical design documentation for our products and therefore record the design costs leading up to a signed development contract as research and development expense when we contract with thirdparty developers we generally select those that have proven technology and experience in the genre of the software being developed which often allows for the establishment of technological feasibility early in the development cycle in instances where the documentation of the design and technology are not in place prior to an executed contract we monitor the software development process and require our thirdparty developers to adhere to the same technological feasibility standards that apply to our internally developed products 

licenses consist of payments and guarantees made to holders of intellectual property rights for use of their trademarks copyrights or other intellectual property rights in the development of our products agreements with license holders generally provide for guaranteed minimum payments for use of their intellectual property certain licenses especially those related to our sports products extend over multiyear periods and encompass multiple game titles in addition to guaranteed minimum payments these licenses frequently contain provisions that could require us to pay royalties to the license holder based on preagreed unit sales thresholds 

licenses consist of payments and guarantees made to holders of intellectual property rights for use of their trademarks copyrights or other intellectual property rights in the development of our products agreements with license holders generally provide for guaranteed minimum payments for use of their intellectual property certain licenses especially those related to our sports products extend over multiyear periods and encompass multiple game titles in addition to guaranteed minimum payments these licenses frequently contain provisions that could require us to pay royalties to the license holder based on preagreed unit sales thresholds 

amortization of capitalized software development costs and licenses commences when a product is released and is recorded on a titlebytitle basis in cost of goods sold for capitalized software development costs amortization is calculated using 1 the proportion of current year revenues to the total revenues expected to be recorded over the life of the title or 2 the straightline method over the remaining estimated useful life of the title whichever is greater for capitalized licenses amortization is calculated as a ratio of 1 current period revenues to the total revenues expected to be recorded over the remaining life of the title or 2 the contractual royalty rate based on actual net product sales as defined in the licensing agreement whichever is greater 

we evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized software development costs and licenses on a quarterly basis recoverability is primarily assessed based on the actual titles performance for products that are scheduled to be released in the future recoverability is evaluated based on the expected performance of the specific products to which the cost or license relates we utilize a number of criteria in evaluating expected product performance including historical performance of comparable products developed with comparable technology market performance of comparable titles orders for the product prior to its release general market conditions and past performance of the franchise when we determine that the value of the title is unlikely to be recovered by product sales capitalized costs are charged to cost of goods sold in the period in which such determination is made 

we have profit and unit sales based internal royalty programs that allow selected employees to each participate in the success of software titles that they assist in developing royalties earned under this program are recorded as a component of cost of goods sold in the period earned 

fair value estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap often requires us to determine the fair value of a particular item to fairly present our consolidated financial statements without an independent market or another representative transaction determining the fair value of a particular item requires us to make several assumptions that are inherently difficult to predict and can have a material influence on the conclusion of the appropriate accounting 

various valuation techniques are used to estimate fair value these include 1 the market approach where market transactions for identical or comparable assets or liabilities are used to determine the fair value 2 the income approach which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts for example future cash flows or future earnings to a single present amount and 3 the cost approach which is based on the amount that would be required to replace an asset for many of our fair value estimates including our estimates of the fair value of acquired intangible assets we use the income approach using the income approach requires the use of financial models which require us to make various estimates including but 

not limited to 1 the potential future cash flows for the asset liability or equity instrument being measured 2 the timing of receipt or payment of those future cash flows 3 the time value of money associated with the delayed receipt or payment of such cash flows and 4 the inherent risk associated with the cash flows risk premium developing these cash flow estimates is inherently difficult and subjective and if any of the estimates used to determine the fair value using the income approach turn out to be inaccurate our financial results may be negatively affected furthermore relatively small changes in many of these estimates can have a significant influence on the estimated fair value resulting from the financial models or the related accounting conclusion reached for example a relatively small change in the estimated fair value of an asset may change a conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired while we are required to make certain fair value assessments associated with the accounting for several types of transactions the following areas are the most sensitive to the assessments 

• business combinations—goodwill and intangible assets we must estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these can have a material effect on our reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various lives goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible assets and intangible assets acquired in a business combination a change in the estimated fair value of an acquired asset or liability assumed often has a direct influence on the amount recognized as goodwill which is an asset that is not amortized often determining the fair value of these acquired assets and liabilities assumed requires an assessment of expected use of the asset the expected cost to extinguish the liability or our expectations related to the timing and the successful completion of development of an acquired inprocess technology such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material influence on our financial statements we use either the income cost or market approach to aid in our conclusions of such fair values and asset lives the income approach presumes that the value of an asset can be estimated by the net economic benefit to be received over the life of the asset discounted to present value the cost approach presumes that an investor would pay no more for an asset than its replacement or reproduction cost the market approach estimates value based on what other participants in the market have paid for reasonably similar assets although each valuation approach is considered in valuing the assets acquired the approach ultimately selected is based on the characteristics of the asset and the availability of information 

we test our goodwill for impairment annually in our second fiscal quarter or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying amount a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment we have determined that we operate in one reporting unit which is our operating segment the determination of whether or not goodwill has become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units changes in our strategy andor market conditions could significantly affect these judgments and require reductions to recorded intangible asset balances we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the fair value of its reporting unit is more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than 50 less than its carrying value before performing the twostep impairment test if the twostep impairment test for goodwill is utilized step one compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value if the carrying value exceeds the fair value there is a potential impairment and step two must be performed step two compares the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill to its implied fair value ie fair value of reporting unit less the fair value of the units assets and liabilities including identifiable intangible assets if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount of goodwill an impairment is recognized based on our annual impairment assessment process for goodwill no impairments were recorded during the fiscal year ended march 31 2016 or 2015 

• longlived assets we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable determining whether impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions including determining which cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset the useful life over which cash flows will occur their amount and the assets residual value if any in turn measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value which is based on the best information available we use internal discounted cash flow estimates quoted market prices when available and independent appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value we derive the required cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans and apply an appropriate discount rate recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset with future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset • inventory obsolescence we regularly review inventory quantities onhand and in the retail channels and record an inventory provision for excess or obsolete inventory based on the future expected demand for our products significant changes in demand for our products would affect managements estimates in establishing our inventory provision we write down inventory based on excess or obsolete inventories determined primarily by future anticipated demand for our products inventory writedowns are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand that are inherently difficult to assess stockbased compensation 

we account for stockbased awards under the fair value method of accounting the fair value of all stockbased compensation is either capitalized and amortized in accordance with our software development cost accounting policy or recognized as expense on a straightline basis over the full vesting period of the awards 

we estimate the fair value of timebased awards to employees using our closing stock price on the date of grant we estimate the fair value of marketbased awards using a monte carlo simulation method which takes into account assumptions such as the expected volatility of our common stock the riskfree interest rate based on the contractual term of the award expected dividend yield vesting schedule and the probability that the market conditions of the awards will be achieved 

we apply variable accounting to our nonemployee stockbased awards whereby we remeasure the value of such awards at each balance sheet date and adjust the value of the awards based on its fair value at the end of the reporting period for nonemployee timebased awards fair value is determined by the closing price of our common stock at the end of the reporting period for nonemployee marketbased awards fair value is determined using a monte carlo simulation method which takes into account assumptions such as the expected volatility of our common stock the riskfree interest rate based on the contractual term of the award expected dividend yield vesting schedule and the probability that the market conditions of the awards will be achieved for nonemployee performancebased awards we do not record an expense until a performance targets have been achieved and once achieved fair value is determined by the closing price of our common stock at the end of the reporting period 

we issue time and performance based restricted stock units to certain employees which currently can only be settled in cash these awards are accounted for as liability awards and we apply variable accounting to these awards whereby we remeasure the value of such awards at each balance sheet date and adjust the value of the awards based on the closing price of our common stock at the end of the reporting period 

changes in the value of the awards from period to period are recorded as stockbased compensation expense over the vesting period 

see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our stockbased compensation arrangements 

income taxes 

we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred income taxes are recognized for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at currently enacted statutory tax rates for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized our history of pretax losses represents sufficient evidence for us to determine that the establishment of a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset is appropriate this valuation allowance offsets deferred tax assets associated with future tax deductions as well as carryforward items 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in addition our filed tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes

financial condition 

we are subject to credit risks particularly if any of our receivables represent a limited number of customers or are concentrated in foreign markets if we are unable to collect our accounts receivable as they become due it could adversely affect our liquidity and working capital position 

generally we have been able to collect our accounts receivable in the ordinary course of business we do not hold any collateral to secure payment from customers we have trade credit insurance on the majority of our customers to mitigate accounts receivable risk 

a majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to major retailers and distributors our five largest customers accounted for 589 646 and 394 of net revenue during the fiscal years ended march 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively as of march 31 2016 and 2015 five customers accounted for 739 and 639 of our gross accounts receivable respectively customers that individually accounted for more than 10 of our gross accounts receivable balance comprised 641 and 545 of such balances at march 31 2016 and 2015 respectively we had three customers who accounted for 352 168 and 121 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2016 and three customers who accounted for 185 184 and 176 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2015 we did not have any additional customers that exceeded 10 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2016 and 2015 based upon performing ongoing credit evaluations maintaining trade credit insurance on a majority of our customers and our past collection experience we believe that the receivable balances from these largest customers do not represent a significant credit risk although we actively monitor each customers credit worthiness and economic conditions that may affect our customers business and access to capital we are monitoring the current global economic conditions including credit markets and other factors as it relates to our customers in order to manage the risk of uncollectible accounts receivable 

we believe our current cash short term investments and projected cash flow from operations along with availability under our credit agreement will provide us with sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash requirements for working capital capital expenditures and commitments on both a shortterm and longterm basis 

as of march 31 2016 the amount of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the us by our foreign subsidiaries was 1854 million these balances are dispersed across various locations around the world we believe that such dispersion meets the business and liquidity needs of our foreign affiliates in addition we expect in the foreseeable future to have the ability to generate sufficient cash domestically to support ongoing operations consequently it is the companys intention to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries in the event we needed to repatriate funds outside of the us such repatriation may be subject to local laws and tax consequences including foreign withholding taxes or us income taxes it is not practicable to estimate the tax liability and we would try to minimize the tax effect to 

the extent possible however any repatriation may not result in significant cash payments as the taxable event would likely be offset by the utilization of the then available tax credits 

in january 2013 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 7500000 shares of our common stock during the fiscal year ended march 31 2014 we repurchased 4217683 shares of our common stock in the open market for 733 million as part of the program in may 2015 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 6717683 shares of our common stock pursuant to the share repurchase program during the fiscal year ended march 31 2016 we repurchased 953647 shares of our common stock in the open market for 266 million as part of the program as of march 31 2016 we have repurchased a total of 5171330 shares of our common stock and have 9046353 shares of our common stock that remain available for repurchase under our share repurchase authorization we are authorized to purchase shares from time to time through a variety of methods including in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws repurchases are subject to the availability of stock prevailing market conditions the trading price of the stock our financial performance and other conditions the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time for any reason 

our changes in cash flows were as follows 



at march 31 2016 we had 7987 million of cash and cash equivalents compared to 9111 million at march 31 2015 the decrease in cash and cash equivalents from march 31 2015 was due primarily to cash used in investing and financing activities partially offset by cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing and financing activities related to purchases of shortterm investments purchases of fixed assets the repurchase of common stock and net share settlements of stockbased awards which were slightly offset by the proceeds received from the sale and maturities of our availableforsale securities net cash provided by operations was due primarily to cash generated from sales of grand theft auto v  nba 2k16 wwe 2k16 and virtual currency partially offset by investments in software development and licenses and the funding of internal royalty payments 

contractual obligations and commitments 

we have entered into various agreements in the ordinary course of business that require substantial cash commitments over the next several years generally these include 

• software development and licensing we make payments to thirdparty software developers that include contractual payments to developers under several software development agreements that expire at various times through january 2022 our aggregate outstanding software development commitments assume satisfactory performance by thirdparty software developers we also have licensing commitments that primarily consist of obligations to holders of intellectual property rights for use of their trademarks copyrights technology or other intellectual property rights in the development of our products 52 

• marketing we have certain minimum marketing support commitments where we commit to spend specified amounts related to marketing our products marketing commitments expire at various times through december 2022 • operating leases our offices are occupied under noncancelable operating leases expiring at various times through june 2024 we also lease certain furniture equipment and automobiles under noncancelable leases expiring through march 2020 some of the leases have fixed rent increases and also include inducements to enter into the lease the effect of such amounts are deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the related lease term • purchase obligations primarily related to agreements to purchase services that are enforceable and legally binding on the company that specifies all significant terms including fixed minimum or variable pricing provisions and the approximate timing of the transactions expiring at various times through january 2019 a summary of annual minimum contractual obligations and commitments as of march 31 2016 is as follows in thousands of dollars 



income taxes at march 31 2016 we had recorded a liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties of 413 million for which we are unable to make a reasonable and reliable estimate of the period in which these liabilities will be settled with the respective tax authorities therefore these liabilities have not been included in the contractual obligations table 

legal and other proceedings we are or may become subject to demands and claims including intellectual property claims and are involved in routine litigation in the ordinary course of business which we do not believe to be material to our business or financial statements we have appropriately accrued amounts related to certain of these claims and legal and other proceedings while it is reasonably possible that a loss may be incurred in excess of the amounts accrued in our financial statements we believe that such losses unless otherwise disclosed would not be material 

on april 11 2016 we filed a declaratory judgment action in the united states district court for the southern district of new york seeking among other things a judicial declaration that leslie benzies the former president of one of our subsidiaries with whom we had been in ongoing discussions regarding his separation of employment is not entitled to any minimum allocation or financial parity with any other person under the applicable royalty plan we believe we will prevail in this matter although there can be no assurance of the outcome on april 12 2016 mr benzies filed a complaint in the supreme court of the state of new york new york county against us and certain of our subsidiaries and employees we removed this case to the united states district court for the southern district of new york where our declaratory judgment action is pending mr benzies complaint claims damages of at least 1500 million and contains allegations of breach of fiduciary duty fraudulent inducement and fraudulent concealment aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty breach of various contracts breach of implied duty of good faith and fair dealing tortious interference with contract unjust enrichment reformation constructive trust declaration of rights constructive discharge defamation and fraud we believe that we have meritorious defenses to these claims and we intend to vigorously defend against them and to pursue any counterclaims 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of march 31 2016 and 2015 we did not have any material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial parties such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such we are not exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 

international operations 

net revenue earned outside of the united states is principally generated by our operations in europe asia australia canada and latin america for the fiscal years ended march 31 2016 2015 and 2014 474 425 and 535 respectively of our net revenue was earned outside the united states we are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade including increased credit risks tariffs and duties fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates shipping delays and international political regulatory and economic developments all of which can have a significant effect on our operating results 

fluctuations in quarterly operating results and seasonality 

we have experienced fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results as a result of the timing of the introduction of new titles variations in sales of titles developed for particular platforms market acceptance of our titles development and promotional expenses relating to the introduction of new titles sequels or enhancements of existing titles projected and actual changes in platforms the timing and success of title introductions by our competitors product returns changes in pricing policies by us and our competitors the accuracy of retailers forecasts of consumer demand the size and timing of acquisitions the timing of orders from major customers and order cancellations and delays in product shipment sales of our products are also seasonal with peak shipments typically occurring in the fourth calendar quarter as a result of increased demand for products during the holiday season for certain of our software products with multiple element revenue arrangements where we do not have vsoe for each element and the deliverables are deemed morethaninconsequential we defer the recognition of our net revenues over an estimated service period which generally ranges from 12 to 36 months as a result the quarter in which we generate the highest net sales volume may be different from the quarter in which we recognize the highest amount of net revenues quarterly comparisons of operating results are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential loss arising from fluctuations in market rates and prices our market risk exposures primarily include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates relates primarily to our shortterm investment portfolio and variable rate debt under the credit agreement 

we seek to manage our interest rate risk by maintaining a shortterm investment portfolio that includes corporate bonds with high credit quality and maturities less than two years since shortterm investments mature relatively quickly and can be reinvested at the thencurrent market rates interest income on a portfolio consisting of shortterm securities is more subject to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer term maturities however the fair value of a shortterm portfolio is less sensitive to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer term securities we do not currently use derivative financial instruments in our shortterm investment portfolio our investments are held for purposes other than trading 

as of march 31 2016 we had 4708 million of shortterm investments which included 2053 million of availableforsale securities the availableforsale securities were recorded at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of tax in stockholders equity we also had 7987 million of cash and cash equivalents that are comprised primarily of money market funds and banktime deposits we determined that based on the composition of our investment portfolio there was no material interest rate risk exposure to our consolidated financial statements or liquidity as of march 31 2016 

historically fluctuations in interest rates have not had a significant effect on our operating results under our credit agreement outstanding balances bear interest at our election of a 025 to 075 above a certain base rate 375 at march 31 2016 or b 125 to 175 above the libor rate approximately 168 at march 31 2016 with the margin rate subject to the achievement of certain average liquidity levels changes in market rates may affect our future interest expense if there is an outstanding balance on our line of credit at march 31 2016 there were no outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement the 175 convertible notes and the 100 convertible notes pay interest semiannually at a fixed rate of 175 and 100 respectively per annum and we expect that there will be no fluctuation related to the convertible notes affecting our cash component of interest expense for additional details on our convertible notes see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we transact business in foreign currencies and are exposed to risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates accounts relating to foreign operations are translated into united states dollars using prevailing exchange rates at the relevant period end translation adjustments are included as a separate component of stockholders equity for the fiscal year ended march 31 2016 and 2015 our foreign currency translation adjustment loss was 74 million and 327 million respectively we recognized a foreign currency exchange transaction loss of 14 million and 21 million for the fiscal years ended march 31 2016 and 2015 respectively and a foreign currency exchange transaction gain of 02 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2014 in interest and other net in our consolidated statements of operations 

balance sheet hedging activities 

we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with nonfunctional currency denominated cash balances and intercompany funding loans nonfunctional currency denominated accounts receivable and nonfunctional currency denominated accounts payable these transactions are not designated as hedging instruments and are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts is reported as either assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value are reported in interest and other net in our consolidated statements of operations we do not enter into derivative financial contracts for speculative or trading purposes at march 31 2016 we had 24 million of forward contracts outstanding to buy foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars and 545 million of forward contracts outstanding to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars all of which have maturities of less than one year at march 31 2015 we had 41 million of forward contracts outstanding to buy foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars and 725 million of forward contracts outstanding to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars all of which have maturities of less than one year for the fiscal years ended march 31 2016 2015 and 2014 we recorded gains of 01 million and 185 million and a loss of 184 million respectively related to foreign currency forward contracts in interest and other net on the consolidated statements of operations as of march 31 2016 the fair value of these outstanding forward contracts was a loss of 01 million and is included in accrued and other current liabilities as of march 31 2015 the fair value of these outstanding forward contracts was 06 million and is included in prepaid expenses and 

other the fair value of these outstanding forward contracts is estimated based on the prevailing exchange rates of the various hedged currencies as of the end of the period 

our hedging programs are designed to reduce but do not entirely eliminate the effect of currency exchange rate movements we believe the counterparties to these foreign currency forward contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks and that the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risks there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations for the fiscal year ended march 31 2016 474 of our revenue was generated outside the united states using sensitivity analysis a hypothetical 10 increase in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would decrease revenues by 47 while a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would increase revenues by 47 in the opinion of management a substantial portion of this fluctuation would be offset by cost of goods sold and operating expenses incurred in local currency

we use a product investment review process to evaluate potential titles for investment to review existing titles in development and to assess titles after release to measure their performance in the market and the return on our investment we apply this process to all of our products whether internally or externally developed the product investment review process includes reviews of each project at various stages of development by our executive management team and the senior management of our publishing labels and includes coordination between our sales and marketing personnel before the launch of titles this disciplined approach to product investment is expected to enhance the competitiveness and profitability of our titles 

we develop our products using a combination of our internal development teams and external development resources acting under contract with us we typically select external developers based on their track record and expertise in developing products in the same category or genre one developer will generally produce the same game for multiple platforms and will also produce sequels to the original game we believe that selecting and using development resources in this manner allows us to leverage the particular expertise of our internal and external development resources which we believe increases the quality of our products

entertainment software titles and hardware for adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support 

• other forms of entertainment such as motion pictures television and audio social networking online computer programs mobile games and other forms of entertainment which may be less expensive or provide other advantages to consumers competition in the entertainment software industry is based on innovation features playability and product quality brand name recognition compatibility with popular platforms access to distribution channels price marketing and customer service our business is driven by hit titles which require increasing budgets for development and marketing competition for our titles is influenced by the timing of competitive product releases and the similarity of such products to our titles and may result in loss of shelf space or a reduction in sellthrough of our titles at retail stores 

trends and factors affecting our business 

product release schedule our financial results are affected by the timing of our product releases and the commercial success of those titles our grand theft auto products in particular have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue sales of grand theft auto products generated approximately 280 of the companys net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015 the timing of our grand theft auto releases varies significantly which in turn may affect our financial performance on a quarterly and annual basis 

economic environment and retailer performance we continue to monitor economic conditions that may unfavorably affect our businesses such as deteriorating consumer demand pricing pressure on our products credit quality of our receivables and foreign currency exchange rates our business is dependent upon a limited number of customers who account for a significant portion of our revenue our five largest customers accounted for 646 394 and 525 of net revenue during the fiscal years ended march 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively as of march 31 2015 and 2014 five customers comprised approximately 639 and 683 of our gross accounts receivable respectively with our significant customers those that individually comprised more than 10 of our gross accounts receivable balance accounting for approximately 545 and 598 of such balance at march 31 2015 and 2014 respectively we had three customers who accounted for approximately 185 184 and 176 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2015 and three customers who accounted for 226 223 and 149 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2014 we did not have any additional customers that exceeded 10 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2015 and 2014 the economic environment has affected our customers in the past and may do so in the future bankruptcies or consolidations of our large retail customers could seriously hurt our business due to uncollectible accounts receivables and the concentration of purchasing power among the remaining large retailers certain of our large customers sell used copies of our games which may negatively affect our business by reducing demand for new copies of our games while the downloadable content that we now offer for certain of our titles may serve to reduce used game sales we expect used game sales to continue to adversely affect our business 

hardware platforms we derive most of our revenue from the sale of products made for video game platforms manufactured by thirdparties such as sonys ps3 and ps4 and microsofts xbox 360 and xbox one which comprised approximately 814 of the companys net revenue by product platform for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015 the success of our business is dependent upon the consumer acceptance of these platforms and the continued growth in the installed base of these platforms when new hardware platforms are introduced demand for software based on older platforms typically declines which may negatively affect our business during the market transition to the new consoles additionally we have limited ability to predict the consumer acceptance of the new platforms which may affect our sales and profitability accordingly our strategy is to focus our development efforts on a select number of the 

highest quality titles for these platforms while also expanding our offerings for emerging platforms such as mobile and online games 

online content and digital distribution the interactive entertainment software industry is delivering a growing amount of content through digital online delivery methods we provide a variety of online delivered products and offerings virtually all of our titles that are available through retailers as packaged goods products are also available through direct digital download via the internet from websites we own and others owned by thirdparties in addition we aim to drive ongoing engagement and recurrent consumer spending on our titles after their initial purchase by generating incremental revenues through downloadable offerings including addon content microtransactions and online play we also publish an expanding variety of titles for tablets and smartphones which are delivered to consumers through digital download via the internet note 14 to our consolidated financial statements segment and geographic information discloses that net revenue from digital online channels comprised approximately 420 of the companys net revenue by distribution channel for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015 we expect online delivery of games and game offerings to become an increasing part of our business over the longterm 

international operations 

international sales are a significant part of our business for the fiscal years ended march 31 2015 2014 and 2013 approximately 425 535 and 415 respectively of our net revenue was earned outside the united states we also have expanded our asian operations in an effort to increase our geographical scope and diversify our revenue base we are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade including increased credit risks tariffs and duties fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates shipping delays and international political regulatory and economic developments all of which can have a significant effect on our operating results see notes 1 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements

employees 

as of march 31 2015 we had approximately 2840 fulltime employees of which approximately 1360 were employed outside of the united states none of our employees is subject to collective bargaining agreements we consider our relations with employees to be satisfactory 




 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties which may affect our future financial performance because of the risks and uncertainties described below as well as other factors affecting our operating results and financial condition past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and our business and financial performance could be harmed and the market value of our securities could decline 

risks relating to our business 

we are dependent on the future success of our grand theft auto products and we must continue to publish hit titles or sequels to such hit titles in order to compete successfully in our industry 

grand theft auto and certain of our other titles are hit products and have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue sales of grand theft auto products generated approximately 280 of the companys net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015 and the ten bestselling franchises including grand theft auto  that significantly contributed to the companys net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015 in the aggregate accounted for approximately 971 of the companys net revenue if we fail to continue to develop and sell new commercially successful hit titles or sequels to such hit titles or experience any delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of our hit titles or their sequels our revenue and profits may decrease substantially and we may incur losses in addition competition in our industry is intense and a relatively small number of hit titles account for a large portion of total revenue in our industry hit products offered by our competitors may take a larger share of consumer spending than we anticipate which could cause revenue generated from our products to fall below our expectations if our competitors develop more successful products or services at lower price points or based on payment models perceived as offering better value or if we do not continue to develop consistently high quality and wellreceived products and services our revenue and profitability may decline in addition both the online and mobile games marketplaces are characterized by frequent product introductions relatively low barriers to entry and new and evolving business methods technologies and platforms for development widespread consumer adoption of these new platforms for games and other technological advances in online or mobile game offerings could negatively affect our sales of console and traditional pc products before we have an opportunity to develop profitable businesses in such markets 

we are subject to product development risks which could result in delays and additional costs and we must adapt to changes in software technologies 

we depend on our internal development studios and thirdparty software developers to develop new interactive entertainment software within anticipated release schedules and cost projections the development cycle for new titles generally ranges from 12 to more than 24 months and our topselling titles could take more than 4 years to develop therefore our development costs can be substantial if we or our third party developers experience unanticipated development delays financial difficulties or additional costs we may not be able to release titles according to our schedule and at budgeted costs there can be no assurance that our products will be sufficiently successful so that we can recoup these costs or make a profit on these products 

additionally in order to stay competitive our internal development studios must anticipate and adapt to rapid technological changes affecting software development any inability to respond to technological advances and implement new technologies could render our products obsolete or less marketable 

the inability of our products to achieve significant market acceptance delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of our products may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

new products may not achieve significant market acceptance generate sufficient sales or be introduced in a timely manner to permit us to recover development manufacturing and marketing costs associated with these products the life cycle of a title generally involves a relatively high level of sales during the first few months after introduction followed by a rapid decline in sales because revenue associated with an initial product launch generally constitutes a high percentage of the total revenue associated with the life of a product delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of one or more new products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results and cause our operating results to be materially different from our expectations 

our business is subject to our ability to develop commercially successful products for the current generation video game platforms 

we derive most of our revenue from the sale of products made for video game platforms manufactured by third parties such as sonys ps3 and ps4 and microsofts xbox 360 and xbox one which comprised approximately 814 of the companys net revenue by product platform for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015 the success of our business is subject to the continued popularity of these platforms and our ability to develop commercially successful products for these platforms 

connectivity issues could affect our ability to sell and provide online services for our products and could affect our profitability 

we rely upon thirdparty digital delivery platforms such as steam microsofts xbox live and sony entertainment network and other thirdparty service providers to provide connectivity from the consumer to our digital products and our online services connectivity issues could prevent customers from accessing this content and our ability to successfully market and sell our products could be adversely affected in addition we could experience similar issues related to services we host on our internal servers such issues also could affect our ability to provide online services and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

our business could be adversely affected if our consumer data protection measures are not seen as adequate or there are breaches of our security measures or unintended disclosures of our consumer data 

we are collecting and storing consumer information including personal information we take measures to protect our consumer data from unauthorized access or disclosure it is possible that our security controls over consumer data may not prevent the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information in addition due to the high profile nature of our products we may draw a disproportionately higher amount of attention and attempts to breach our security controls than companies with lower profile products a security breach that leads to disclosure of consumer account information including personally identifiable information could harm our reputation compel us to comply with disparate breach notification laws in various jurisdictions and otherwise subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue a resulting perception that our products or services do not adequately protect the privacy of personal information could result in a loss of current or potential consumers and business partners in addition if any of our business partners experience a security breach that leads to disclosure of consumer account information our reputation could be harmed resulting in loss of revenue 

the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the us europe and elsewhere are often uncertain contradictory and in flux it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices if so this could result in government 

imposed fines or orders requiring that we change our data practices which could have an adverse effect on our business complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business financial condition and operating results 

in addition certain of our products are online enabled the ability of our products to offer online functionality and our ability to offer content through a video game platforms digital distribution channel is dependent upon the continued operation and security of such platforms online network these third party networks as well as our own internal systems and websites and the security measures related thereto may be breached as a result of thirdparty action including intentional misconduct by computer hackers employee error malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers data or our data including our intellectual property and other confidential business information or our information technology systems because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs we may lose business suffer irreparable damage to our reputation andor incur significant costs and expenses relating to the investigation and possible litigation of claims relating to such event 

security breaches involving the source code for our products could adversely affect our business 

we securely store the source code for our interactive entertainment software products as it is created a breach whether physical electronic or otherwise of the systems on which such source code and other sensitive data are stored could lead to damage or piracy of our software if we are subject to data security breaches we may have a loss in sales or increased costs arising from the restoration or implementation of additional security measures which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results any theft andor unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an event could adversely affect our competitive position reputation brand and future sales of our products our business could be subject to significant disruption and we could suffer monetary and other losses and reputational harm in the event of such incidents and claims 

our efforts to expand into new products and services may subject us to additional risks 

in recent years we have invested in emerging opportunities in interactive entertainment played on mobile platforms including tablets and smartphones and online platforms including social networks we have also grown our product offerings that are available through digital download we are actively investing to capitalize on these trends in order to diversify our product mix reduce our operating risks and increase our revenue there are risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed there is no assurance that we will be able to attract a sufficiently large number of customers or recover costs incurred for developing and marketing these new products or services external factors such as competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of any new products or services failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we depend on our key management and product development personnel 

our continued success will depend to a significant extent on our senior management team and our relationship with zelnickmedia corporation zelnickmedia our executive chairmanchief executive officer and president are partners of zelnickmedia we are also highly dependent on the expertise skills and knowledge of certain of our rockstar employees and other key creative personnel responsible for 

content creation and development of our grand theft auto titles and titles based on other brands we may not be able to continue to retain these personnel at current compensation levels or at all 

the loss of the services of our executive officers zelnickmedia our key rockstar employees or other key creative personnel could significantly harm our business in addition if one or more key employees were to join a competitor or form a competing company we may lose additional personnel experience material interruptions in product development delays in bringing products to market and difficulties in our relationships with licensors suppliers and customers which would significantly harm our business failure to continue to attract and retain other qualified management and creative personnel could adversely affect our business and prospects 

declines in consumer spending and other adverse changes in the economy could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

most of our products involve discretionary spending on the part of consumers we believe that consumer spending is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income this makes our products particularly sensitive to general economic conditions and economic cycles as consumers are generally more willing to make discretionary purchases including purchases of products like ours during periods in which favorable economic conditions prevail adverse economic conditions such as a prolonged us or international general economic downturn including periods of increased inflation unemployment levels tax rates interest rates energy prices or declining consumer confidence could also reduce consumer spending reduced consumer spending has and may in the future continue to result in reduced demand for our products and may also require increased selling and promotional expenses which has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results in addition during periods of relative economic weakness our consolidated credit risk reflecting our counterparty dealings with distributors customers capital providers and others may increase perhaps materially so furthermore uncertainty and adverse changes in the economy could also increase the risk of material losses on our investments increase costs associated with developing and publishing our products increase the cost and availability of sources of financing and increase our exposure to material losses from bad debts any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results if economic conditions worsen our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 

changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and in various other jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are required to estimate future taxes although we currently believe our tax estimates are reasonable the estimate process is inherently uncertain and such estimates are not binding on tax authorities further our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by a variety of factors including changes in the business including the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in tax elections and changes in applicable tax laws additionally tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities and developments in those audits could adversely affect our income tax provision should the ultimate tax liability exceed estimates our income tax provision and net income or loss could be adversely affected 

historically we recorded a valuation allowance against most of our us deferred tax assets we expect to provide a valuation allowance on future us tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability or until other significant positive evidence arises that suggest that these benefits are more likely than not to be realized further our tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities and developments 

in those audits could adversely affect our income tax provision should our ultimate tax liability exceed our estimates our income tax provision and net income or loss could be materially affected 

we earn a significant amount of our operating income and hold a significant portion of our cash outside the us any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions may result in higher effective tax rates for the company in addition there have been proposals to change us tax laws that would significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings although we cannot predict whether or in what form this proposed legislation will pass if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our income tax provision and financial condition 

we are also required to pay taxes other than income taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the us and foreign jurisdictions we are regularly under examination by tax authorities with respect to these nonincome taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations changes in our business or changes in applicable tax rules will not have an adverse effect on our net income or loss and financial condition 

our quarterly operating results are dependent on the release of hit titles and are highly seasonal which may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate significantly 

we have experienced and may continue to experience wide fluctuations in quarterly operating results the release of a hit title typically leads to a high level of sales during the first few months after introduction followed by a rapid decline in sales in addition the interactive entertainment industry is highly seasonal with sales typically higher during the fourth calendar quarter due primarily to increased demand for games during the holiday season demand for and sales of our sports titles are also seasonal in that they are typically released just prior to the start of the sport season which they depict if a key event or sports season to which our product release schedule is tied were to be delayed or cancelled our sales might also suffer disproportionately our failure or inability to produce hit titles or introduce products on a timely basis to meet seasonal fluctuations in demand could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results the uncertainties associated with software development manufacturing lead times production delays and the approval process for products by hardware manufacturers and other licensors make it difficult to predict the quarter in which our products will ship and therefore may cause us to fail to meet financial expectations 

returns of our published titles by our customers and price concessions granted to our customers may adversely affect our operating results 

we are exposed to the risk of product returns and price concessions with respect to our customers our distribution arrangements with customers generally do not give them the right to return titles to us or to cancel firm orders however we sometimes accept product returns from our distribution customers for stock balancing and negotiate accommodations for customers which include credits and returns when demand for specific products falls below expectations we accept returns and grant price concessions in connection with our publishing arrangements and revenue is recognized after deducting estimated reserves for returns and price concessions while we believe that we can reliably estimate future returns and price concessions if return rates and price concessions for our products exceed our reserves our revenue could decline which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

increased sales of used video game products could lower our sales 

certain of our larger customers sell used video games which are generally priced lower than new video games if our customers increase their sales of used video games it could negatively affect our sales of new video games and have an adverse influence on our business financial condition and operating results 

a limited number of customers account for a significant portion of our sales the loss of a principal customer or other significant business relationship could seriously hurt our business 

a substantial portion of our product sales are made to a limited number of customers sales to our five largest customers during the fiscal year ended march 31 2015 accounted for approximately 646 of our net revenue with gamestop accounting for 210 our sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders without longterm agreements or other commitments and our customers may terminate their relationship with us at any time certain of our customers may decline to carry products containing mature content the loss of our relationships with principal customers or a decline in sales to principal customers including as a result of a product being rated ao age 18 and over could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

furthermore our customers may also be placed into bankruptcy become insolvent or be liquidated due to economic downturns global contractions of credit or for other factors bankruptcies or consolidations of certain large retail customers could seriously hurt our business including as a result of uncollectible accounts receivable from such customers and the concentration of purchasing power among remaining large retailers in addition our results of operations may be adversely affected if certain of our customers who purchase on credit terms are no longer eligible to purchase on such terms due to their financial distress which may reduce the quantity of products they demand from us 

if our marketing and advertising efforts fail to resonate with consumers our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 

our products are marketed worldwide through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs such as television and online advertising print advertising retail merchandising website development and event sponsorship our ability to sell our products and services is dependent in part on the success of these programs if the marketing for our products and services fails to resonate with consumers particularly during the holiday season or other key selling periods or if advertising rates or other media placement costs increase these factors could have a material adverse influence on our business financial condition and operating results 

the interactive entertainment software industry is highly competitive 

we compete for both licenses to properties and the sale of interactive entertainment software with sony and microsoft each of which is a large developer and marketer of software for its own platforms we also compete with domestic game publishers such as activision blizzard and electronic arts and international publishers such as capcom sega square enix and ubisoft as our business is dependent upon our ability to develop hit titles which require increasing budgets for development and marketing the availability of significant financial resources has become a major competitive factor in developing and marketing software games some of our competitors have greater financial technical personnel and other resources than we do and are able to finance larger budgets for development and marketing and make higher offers to licensors and developers for commercially desirable properties our titles also compete with other forms of entertainment such as social media and casual games in addition to motion pictures television and audio and video products featuring similar themes online computer programs and other entertainment which may be less expensive or provide other advantages to consumers 

a number of software publishers who compete with us have developed and commercialized or are currently developing online games for use by consumers over the internet if technological advances significantly increase the availability of online games and if consumer acceptance of online gaming grows substantially it could result in a decline in our platformbased software sales and negatively affect sales of such products 

increased competition for limited shelf space and promotional support from retailers could affect the success of our business and require us to incur greater expenses to market our titles 

retailers have limited shelf space and promotional resources and competition is intense among newly introduced interactive entertainment software titles for adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support competition for retail shelf space is expected to continue to increase which may require us to increase our marketing expenditures to maintain desirable sales levels of our titles competitors with more extensive lines and more popular titles may have greater bargaining power with retailers accordingly we may not be able or we may have to pay more than our competitors to achieve similar levels of promotional support and shelf space 

our business is partly dependent on our ability to enter into successful software development arrangements with thirdparties 

our success depends on our ability to continually identify and develop new titles on a timely basis we rely on thirdparty software developers for the development of some of our titles quality thirdparty developers are continually in high demand software developers who have developed titles for us in the past may not be available to develop software for us in the future due to the limited number of thirdparty software developers and the limited control that we exercise over them these developers may not be able to complete titles for us on a timely basis or within acceptable quality standards if at all we have entered into agreements with thirdparties to acquire the rights to publish and distribute interactive entertainment software as well as to use licensed intellectual properties in our titles these agreements typically require us to make development payments pay royalties and satisfy other conditions our development payments may not be sufficient to permit developers to develop new software successfully which could result in material delays and significantly increase our costs to bring particular products to market software development costs promotion and marketing expenses and royalties payable to software developers and thirdparty licensors have increased significantly in recent years and reduce potential profits derived from sales of our software future sales of our titles may not be sufficient to recover development payments and advances to software developers and licensors and we may not have adequate financial and other resources to satisfy our contractual commitments to such developers if we fail to satisfy our obligations under agreements with thirdparty developers and licensors the agreements may be terminated or modified in ways that are burdensome to us and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we cannot publish our titles without the approval of hardware licensors that are also our competitors 

we are required to obtain licenses from sony and microsoft which are also our competitors to develop and publish titles for their respective hardware platforms our existing platform licenses require that we obtain approval for the publication of new titles on a titlebytitle basis as a result the number of titles we are able to publish for these hardware platforms our ability to manage the timing of the release of these titles and accordingly our net revenue from titles for these hardware platforms may be limited if a licensor chooses not to renew or extend our license agreement at the end of its current term or if a licensor were to terminate our license for any reason or does not approve one or more of our titles we may be unable to publish that title as well as additional titles for that licensors platform termination of any such agreements or disapproval of titles could seriously hurt our business and prospects we may be unable to continue to enter into license agreements for certain current generation platforms on satisfactory terms or at all failure to enter into any such agreement could also seriously hurt our business 

we rely on a limited number of channel partners some of whom influence the fee structures for online distribution of our games on their platforms 

we rely on a limited number of channel partners some of whom have retained the right to change the fee structures for online distribution of both paid content and free content including patches and corrections 

that we license to them for distribution on their platforms such channel partners ability to set or influence royalty rates may increase costs which could negatively affect our operating margins we may be unable to distribute our content in a costeffective or profitable manner through such distribution channel which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

outside of fee arrangements our agreements with our channel partners sometimes give them significant control over other aspects of the distribution of our products and services that we develop for their platform if our channel partners establish terms that restrict our offerings through their channels or significantly impact the financial terms on which these products or services are offered to our customers we may be unable to distribute our product offerings through them or be forced to do so on a materially worse financial or business terms 

we may not be able to adequately adjust our cost structure in a timely fashion in response to a sudden decrease in demand 

in the event of a significant decline in revenue we may not be able to dispose of facilities reduce personnel or make other changes to our cost structure without disruption to our operations or without significant termination and exit costs management may not be able to implement such actions in a timely manner if at all to offset an immediate shortfall in revenue and profit moreover reducing costs may impair our ability to produce and develop software titles at sufficient levels in the future 

the increasing importance of digital sales to our business exposes us to the risks of that business model including greater competition 

the proportion of our revenues derived from digital content delivery as compared to traditional retail sales may continue to increase the increased importance of digital content delivery in our industry increases our potential competition as the minimum capital needed to produce and publish a digitally delivered game is significantly less than that needed to produce and publish one that is purchased through retail distribution and is played on a game console this will also require us to dedicate capital to developing and implementing alternative marketing strategies which we may not do successfully if either occurs we may be unable to effectively market and distribute our products which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results in addition a continuing shift to digital delivery could result in a deprioritization of our products by traditional retailers 

we depend on servers and internet bandwidth to operate our games and digital services with online features if we were to lose server capacity or lack sufficient internet bandwidth for any reason our business could suffer 

we rely on data servers including those owned or controlled by third parties to enable our customers to download our games and other downloadable content and to operate our online games and other products with online functionality events such as limited hardware failure any broadbased catastrophic server malfunction a significant intrusion by hackers that circumvents security measures or a failure of disaster recovery services would likely interrupt the functionality of our games with online services and could result in a loss of sales for games and related services an extended interruption of service could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we expect a significant portion of our games to be online enabled in the future and therefore we must project our future server needs and make advance purchases of servers or server capacity to accommodate expected business demands if we underestimate the amount of server capacity our business requires or if our business were to grow more quickly than expected our consumers may experience service problems such as slow or interrupted gaming access insufficient server capacity may result in decreased sales a loss of our consumer base and adverse consequences to our reputation conversely if we overestimate the amount of server capacity required by our business we may incur additional operating costs 

because of the potential importance of our online business to our revenues and results of operations our ability to access adequate internet bandwidth and online computational resources to support our business is critical if the price of either such resource increases we may not be able to increase our prices or subscriber levels to compensate for such costs which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we submit our products for rating by the entertainment software rating board esrb in the united states and other voluntary or government ratings organizations in foreign countries failure to obtain a target rating for certain of our products could negatively affect our ability to distribute and sell those games as could the rerating of a game for any reason 

we voluntarily submit our game products to the esrb a usbased nonprofit and independent ratings organization the esrb system provides consumers with information about game content using a rating symbol that generally suggests the appropriate player age group and specific content descriptors such as graphic violence profanity or sexually explicit material the esrb may impose significant penalties on game publishers for violations of its rules related to rating or marketing games including revocation of a rating or monetary fines up to 1 million other countries require voluntary or government backed ratings as prerequisites for product sales in some instances we may have to modify our products in order to market them under the target rating which could delay or disrupt the release of our products in addition some of our titles may not be sold at all or without extensive edits in certain countries such as germany 

in the united states if the esrb rates a game as ao age 18 and older platform licensors may not certify the game and retailers may refuse to sell it in addition some consumers have reacted to reratings or controversial game content by refusing to purchase such games demanding refunds for games that they had already purchased and refraining from buying other games published by us many of our rockstar titles and certain of our 2k titles have been rated m age 17 and older by the esrb if we are unable to obtain m ratings and instead receive ao ratings on future versions of those or similar titles as a result of changes in the esrbs ratings standards or for other reasons including the adoption of legislation in this area our business and prospects could be negatively affected if any of our games are rerated by the esrb or other foreign based ratings organizations we could be exposed to litigation administrative fines and penalties and other potential liabilities and our operating results and financial condition could be significantly affected 

we have implemented processes to comply with the requirements of the esrb and other ratings organizations and properly display the designated rating symbols and content descriptions nonetheless these processes are subject to human error circumvention overriding and reasonable resource constraints if a video game we published were found to contain undisclosed pertinent content the esrb could rerate a game retailers could refuse to sell it and demand that we accept the return of any unsold copies or returns from customers and consumers could refuse to buy it or demand that we refund their money this could have a material negative affect on our operating results and financial condition in addition we may be exposed to litigation administrative fines and penalties and our reputation could be harmed which could affect sales of other video games we sell if any of these consequences were to occur our business and financial performance could be significantly harmed 

content policies adopted by retailers consumer opposition and litigation could negatively affect sales of our products 

retailers may decline to sell interactive entertainment software containing what they judge to be graphic violence or sexually explicit material or other content that they deem inappropriate for their businesses if retailers decline to sell our products based upon their opinion that they contain objectionable themes graphic violence or sexually explicit material or other generally objectionable content or if any of our previously m rated series products are rated ao we might be required to significantly change or discontinue particular titles or series which in the case of our bestselling grand theft auto titles could 

seriously affect our business consumer advocacy groups have opposed sales of interactive entertainment software containing objectionable themes violence or sexual material or other objectionable content by pressing for legislation in these areas and by engaging in public demonstrations and media campaigns additionally although lawsuits seeking damages for injuries allegedly suffered by thirdparties as a result of video games have generally been unsuccessful in the courts claims of this kind have been asserted against us from time to time and may be asserted and be successful in the future 

we are subject to risks and uncertainties of international trade including fluctuations in the values of local foreign currencies against the dollar 

sales in international markets primarily in europe have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015 approximately 425 of our net revenue was earned outside the united states we have also expanded our asian operations in an effort to increase our geographical scope and diversify our revenue base we are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade including increased credit risks tariffs and duties fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates shipping delays and international political regulatory and economic developments all of which can have a significant influence on our operating results many of our international sales are made in local currencies which could fluctuate against the dollar while we may use forward exchange contracts to a limited extent to seek to mitigate foreign currency risk our operating results could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations 

we face risks from our international operations 

we are subject to certain risks because of our international operations particularly as we continue to grow our business and presence in asia latin america and other parts of the world changes to and compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations may increase our cost of doing business and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals could harm our international and domestic sales trade legislation in either the united states or other countries such as a change in the current tariff structures importexport compliance laws or other trade laws or policies could adversely affect our ability to sell or to distribute in international markets we incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our international operations and could become subject to legal penalties in foreign countries if we do not comply with local laws and regulations which may be substantially different from those in the united states in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it may be common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by united states laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and by local laws such as laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations including those based in or from countries where practices which violate such laws may be customary will not take actions in violation of our policies any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could have a material adverse effect on our business 

if we are unable to protect the intellectual property relating to our software the commercial value of our products will be adversely affected and our competitive position could be harmed 

we develop proprietary software and have obtained the rights to publish and distribute software developed by thirdparties we attempt to protect our software and production techniques under copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as through contractual restrictions on disclosure copying and distribution our software is susceptible to piracy and unauthorized copying unauthorized thirdparties may be able to copy or to reverse engineer our software to obtain and use programming or production techniques that we regard as proprietary well organized piracy operations have also proliferated in recent years resulting in the ability to download pirated copies of our software over the internet although we attempt to incorporate protective measures into our software piracy of our products could negatively affect our future profitability 

if we infringe on or are alleged to infringe on the intellectual property rights of thirdparties our business could be adversely affected 

as our industry grows we may be subject to an increasing amount of litigation that is common in the software industry based on allegations of infringement or other alleged violations of patent copyright andor trademarks in addition we believe that interactive entertainment software will increasingly become the subject of claims that such software infringes on the intellectual property rights of others with both the growth of online functionality and advances in technology game content and software graphics as games become more realistic from time to time we receive notices from thirdparties or are named in lawsuits by thirdparties alleging infringement of their proprietary rights although we believe that our software and technologies and the software and technologies of thirdparty developers and publishers with whom we have contractual relations do not and will not infringe or violate proprietary rights of others it is possible that infringement of proprietary rights of others may occur any claims of infringement with or without merit could be time consuming costly and difficult to defend moreover intellectual property litigation or claims could require us to discontinue the distribution of products obtain a license or redesign our products which could result in additional substantial costs and material delays 

our software is susceptible to errors which can harm our financial results and reputation 

the technological advancements of new hardware platforms result in the development of more complex software products as software products become more complex the risk of undetected errors in new products increases we may need to produce and distribute patches in order to repair such errors which could be costly and may distract our developers from working on new products if despite testing errors are found in new products or releases after shipments have been made we could experience a loss of or delay in timely market acceptance product returns loss of revenue increases in costs relating to the repair of such errors and damage to our reputation 

if we acquire or invest in other businesses intellectual properties or other assets we may be unable to integrate them with our business our financial performance may be impaired andor we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for such transactions 

if appropriate opportunities present themselves we may acquire or make investments in businesses intellectual properties and other assets that we believe are strategic we may not be able to identify negotiate or finance any future acquisition or investment successfully even if we do succeed in acquiring or investing in a business intellectual property or other asset such acquisitions and investments involve a number of risks including 

• retaining key employees and maintaining the key business and customer relationships of the businesses we acquire • cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from an acquired company or business into our organization • the possibility that the combined company would not achieve the expected benefits including any anticipated operating and product synergies of the acquisition as quickly as anticipated or that the costs of or operational difficulties arising from an acquisition would be greater than anticipated • significant acquisitionrelated accounting adjustments particularly relating to an acquired companys deferred revenue that may cause reported revenue and profits of the combined company to be lower than the sum of their standalone revenue and profits • significant accounting charges resulting from the completion and integration of a sizeable acquisition and increased capital expenditures including potential impairment charges incurred to write down the carrying amount of intangible assets generated as a result of an acquisition 19 

• the possibility that we will not discover important facts during due diligence that could have a material adverse effect on the value of the businesses we acquire including the possibility that a change of control of a company we acquire triggers a termination of contractual or intellectual property rights important to the operation of its business • the need to integrate an acquired companys accounting management information human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management and timely reporting and the need to implement or remediate controls procedures and policies appropriate for a public company in an acquired company that prior to the acquisition lacked these controls procedures and policies • litigation or other claims in connection with or inheritance of claims or litigation risks as a result of an acquisition including claims from terminated employees customers or other thirdparties and • to the extent that we engage in strategic transactions outside of the united states we face additional risks including risks related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages currency risks and the particular economic political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries future acquisitions and investments could also involve the issuance of our equity and equitylinked securities potentially diluting our existing stockholders the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses writeoffs of goodwill intangibles or acquired inprocess technology or other increased cash and noncash expenses such as stock based compensation any of the foregoing factors could harm our financial condition or prevent us from achieving improvements in our financial condition and operating performance that could have otherwise been achieved by us on a standalone basis our stockholders may not have the opportunity to review vote on or evaluate future acquisitions or investments 

our ability to acquire and maintain licenses to intellectual property especially for sports titles affects our revenue and profitability competition for these licenses may make them more expensive and increase our costs 

certain of our products are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others for example certain of our 2k products include rights licensed from major sports leagues and players associations similarly some of our other titles are based on licenses of popular entertainment products competition for these licenses is intense if we are unable to maintain these licenses or obtain additional licenses on reasonable economic terms or with significant commercial value our revenue and profitability could decline significantly competition for these licenses may also increase the advances guarantees and royalties that we must pay to the licensor which could significantly increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability in addition on certain intellectual property licenses we are subject to guaranteed minimum payments royalties or standards of performance and may not be able to terminate these agreements prior to their stated expiration if such licensed products do not generate revenues in excess of such minimum guarantees our profitability will be adversely affected 

we may need additional capital if we incur losses 

if we incur losses in the future we may be required to raise additional capital in order to fund our operations we could seek to raise capital in a number of ways including through the issuance of debt or equity or through other financing arrangements in august 2014 we entered into a third amendment to the second amended and restated credit agreement as amended the credit agreement which requires us to make periodic interest or other debt service payments in addition we issued 175 convertible notes due 2016 in november 2011 and 100 convertible notes due 2018 in june 2013 the 175 convertible notes and together with the 100 convertible notes the convertible notes which require us to make periodic interest payments to the holders of the convertible notes if we borrow additional funds further debt service payments would probably be necessary in addition the terms of 

additional debt may impose significant restrictions on our ability to operate our business if we seek financing through the sale of equity or equitybased securities such as our convertible notes our current stockholders will suffer dilution in their percentage ownership of common stock we cannot be certain as to our ability to raise additional capital in the future or under what terms capital would be available if we need to raise capital and are not successful in doing so we will have to consider other options that may include but are not limited to a reduction in our expenditures for internal and external new product development reductions in overhead expenses and sales of intellectual property and other assets these actions should they become necessary will likely result in a reduction in the size of our operations and could materially affect the prospects of our business 

we are subject to contractual covenants which place certain limitations on how we manage our business  

our credit agreement and the indentures governing our convertible notes may limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt paying dividends repurchasing shares and acquiring or disposing of assets or businesses in addition we have granted a security interest in connection with certain compensatory arrangements which limits our ability to incur senior debt in excess of certain amounts accordingly we may be restricted from taking actions that management believes would be desirable and in the best interests of us and our stockholders our credit agreement and the indentures also require us to satisfy specified financial and nonfinancial covenants a breach of any of the covenants contained in our credit agreement could result in an event of default under the agreement and under the indentures governing our convertible notes and would allow our lenders and noteholders to pursue various remedies including accelerating the repayment of any outstanding indebtedness 

our business and products are subject to potential legislation the adoption of such proposed legislation could limit the retail market for our products 

several proposals have been made for federal legislation to regulate our industry such proposals seek to prohibit the sale of products containing certain content included in some of our games if any such proposals are enacted into law it may limit the potential market for some of our games in the united states and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results other countries such as germany have adopted laws regulating content both in packaged games and those transmitted over the internet that are stricter than current united states laws in the united states proposals have also been made by numerous state legislators to regulate and prohibit the sale of interactive entertainment software products containing certain types of violent or sexual content to under 17 or 18 audiences such as the state of californias ultraviolent video games law that sought to ban the sale or rental of violent video games to minors while such legislation to date has been enjoined by industry and retail groups or been found unconstitutional the adoption into law of such legislation in federal andor in state jurisdictions in which we do significant business could severely limit the retail market for some of our games 

we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill becomes impaired 

we are required under us generally accepted accounting principles to review our goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating a requirement to reevaluate whether our goodwill continues to be recoverable include a significant decline in stock price and market capitalization slower growth rates in our industry or other materially adverse events we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill is determined this may adversely affect our operating results 

our reported financial results could be adversely affected by the application of existing or future accounting standards to our business as it evolves 

our reported financial results are affected by the accounting policies promulgated by the sec and national accounting standards bodies and the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies for example standards regarding software revenue recognition have and could further significantly affect the way we account for revenue related to our products and services as we enhance expand and diversify our business and product offerings the application of existing or future financial accounting standards particularly those relating to the way we account for revenue could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results although not necessarily on our cash flows 

risks relating to our common stock 

for purposes of this section risks relating to our common stock references to the company we our and us refer only to taketwo interactive software inc and not to its subsidiaries 

additional issuances of equity securities by us would dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders 

we may issue equity or equitybased securities such as our convertible notes in the future in connection with acquisitions or strategic transactions to adjust our ratio of debt to equity including through repayment of outstanding debt to fund expansion of our operations or for other purposes to the extent we issue additional equity securities the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders would be reduced 

there is no guarantee that we will do additional share repurchases in the future 

the share repurchase program authorized by the board of directors which authorized the repurchase of up to 7500000 shares of our common stock and had 3283000 shares available for repurchase as of march 31 2015 does not obligate the company to make any purchases at any specific time or situation on may 13 2015 our board of directors approved an increase to the share repurchase authorization increasing the total number of shares that the company is permitted to repurchase to up to 10000000 shares of our common stock discontinuing repurchases could adversely affect the price of the companys common stock the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time for any reason 

future sales or other issuances of our common stock could adversely affect its market price 

the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect its price the sale or the availability for sale of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause the price of our common stock to decline the issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of our convertible notes could also adversely affect the price of our common stock 

our stock price has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly 

the market price of our common stock historically has been and we expect will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us including those discussed in the risk factors in this section as well as others not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material to changes in securities analysts earnings estimates or ratings to our results or future financial guidance falling below our expectations and analysts and investors expectations to factors affecting the computer software entertainment media or electronics industries or to national or international economic conditions 

stock markets in general have experienced over the years and continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected market prices for companies such as ours and that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the affected companies these broad 

market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock regardless of our operating performance 

delaware law our charter documents and provisions of our debt agreements may impede or discourage a takeover which could cause the market price of our shares to decline 

we are a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a thirdparty to acquire control of us even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders our board of directors has the power without stockholder approval to adopt a stockholder rights plan andor to designate the terms of one or more series of preferred stock and issue shares of preferred stock in addition we may under certain circumstances involving a change of control be obligated to repurchase all or a portion of our convertible notes and any potential acquirer would be required to assume our obligations related to any outstanding convertible notes we or any possible acquirer may not have available financial resources necessary to repurchase those notes the ability of our board of directors to create and issue a new series of preferred stock and certain provisions of delaware law our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the indenture governing our notes could impede a merger takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock which under certain circumstances could reduce the market price of our common stock and the value of any outstanding notes 

our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future years taxes could be substantially limited if we experience an ownership change as defined in the internal revenue code 

section 382 of the internal revenue code contains rules that limit the ability of a company to use its net operating loss carryforwards in years after an ownership change which is generally defined as any change in ownership of more than 50 of its stock over a threeyear testing period these rules generally operate by focusing on ownership changes among stockholders owning directly or indirectly 5 or more of the stock of a company andor any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of stock by the company if as a result of future transactions involving our common stock including purchases or sales of stock by 5 stockholders we undergo cumulative ownership changes which exceed 50 over the testing period our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards would be subject to additional limitations under section 382 

generally if an ownership change occurs the annual taxable income limitation on the use of net operating loss carryforwards is equal to the product of the applicable longterm tax exempt rate and the value of the companys stock immediately before the ownership change depending on the resulting limitation a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards could expire before we would be able to use them 

our inability to fully utilize our net operating losses to offset taxable income generated in the future could have a material and negative affect on our future financial position and results of operations

our revenue is primarily derived from the sale of internally developed software titles and software titles developed by thirdparties for our benefit operating margins are dependent in part upon our ability to release new commercially successful software products and to manage effectively their development costs we have internal development studios located in canada china czech republic the united kingdom and the united states 

software titles published by our rockstar games label are primarily internally developed we expect rockstar games our whollyowned publisher of the grand theft auto  max payne  midnight club  red dead and other popular franchises to continue to be a leader in the action  adventure product category and to create groundbreaking entertainment by leveraging our existing titles as well as by developing new brands we believe that rockstar has established a uniquely original popular cultural phenomenon with its grand theft auto series which is the interactive entertainment industrys most iconic and critically acclaimed brand and has soldin over 210 million units the latest installment grand theft auto v  was released on sonys ps3 and microsofts xbox 360 in september 2013 on onys ps4 and microsofts xbox one in november 2014 and on pc in april 2015 grand theft auto v includes access to grand theft auto online  which initially launched in october 2013 rockstar is also well known for developing brands in other genres including the la noire  bully and manhunt franchises rockstar continues to expand on our established franchises by developing sequels offering downloadable episodes content and virtual currency and releasing titles for smartphones and tablets 

our 2k label has published a variety of popular entertainment properties across all key platforms and across a range of genres including shooter action roleplaying strategy sports and familycasual entertainment we expect 2k to continue to develop new successful franchises in the future 2ks internally owned and developed franchises include the critically acclaimed multimillion unit selling 

bioshock  mafia  sid meiers civilization and xcom enemy unknown series 2k also publishes successful externally developed franchises such as borderlands and evolve  2ks realistic sports simulation titles include our flagship nba 2k series which has been the topranked nba basketball video game for 14 years running and the wwe 2k series

trends and factors affecting our business 

product release schedule our financial results are affected by the timing of our product releases and the commercial success of those titles our grand theft auto products in particular have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue sales of grand theft auto products generated approximately 280 of the companys net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015 the timing of our grand theft auto releases varies significantly which in turn may affect our financial performance on a quarterly and annual basis 

economic environment and retailer performance we continue to monitor economic conditions that may unfavorably affect our businesses such as deteriorating consumer demand pricing pressure on our products credit quality of our receivables and foreign currency exchange rates our business is dependent upon a limited number of customers who account for a significant portion of our revenue our five largest customers accounted for 646 394 and 525 of net revenue during the fiscal years ended march 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively as of march 31 2015 and 2014 our five largest customers comprised approximately 639 and 683 of our gross accounts receivable respectively with our significant customers those that individually comprised more than 10 of our gross accounts receivable balance accounting for approximately 545 and 598 of such balance at march 31 2015 and 2014 respectively we had three customers who accounted for approximately 185 184 and 176 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2015 and three customers who accounted for 226 223 and 149 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2014 we did not have any additional customers that exceeded 10 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2015 and 2014 the economic environment has affected our customers in the past and may do so in the future bankruptcies or consolidations of our large retail customers could seriously hurt our business due to uncollectible accounts receivables and the concentration of purchasing power among the remaining large retailers certain of our large customers sell used copies of our games which may negatively affect our business by reducing demand for new copies of our games while the downloadable content that we now offer for certain of our titles may serve to reduce used game sales we expect used game sales to continue to adversely affect our business 

hardware platforms we derive most of our revenue from the sale of products made for video game platforms manufactured by thirdparties such as sonys ps3 and ps4 and microsofts xbox 360 and xbox one which comprised approximately 814 of the companys net revenue by product platform for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015 the success of our business is dependent upon the consumer acceptance of these platforms and the continued growth in the installed base of these platforms when new hardware platforms are introduced demand for software based on older platforms typically declines which may negatively affect our business during the market transition to the new consoles we continually monitor console hardware sales we manage our product delivery on each current and future platform in a manner we believe to be most effective to maximize our revenue opportunities and achieve the desired return on our investments in product development additionally our development costs are generally higher for 

titles during platform transition periods and we have a limited ability to predict the consumer acceptance of the future platforms which may affect our sales and profitability accordingly our strategy is to focus our development efforts on a select number of the highest quality titles for these platforms while also expanding our offerings for emerging platforms such as mobile and online games 

online content and digital distribution the interactive entertainment software industry is delivering a growing amount of content through digital online delivery methods we provide a variety of online delivered products and offerings virtually all of our titles that are available through retailers as packaged goods products are also available through direct digital download via the internet from websites we own and others owned by thirdparties in addition we aim to drive ongoing engagement and recurrent consumer spending on our titles after their initial purchase by generating incremental revenues through downloadable offerings including addon content microtransactions and online play we also publish an expanding variety of titles for tablets and smartphones which are delivered to consumers through digital download via the internet note 14 to our consolidated financial statements segment and geographic information discloses that net revenue from digital online channels comprised approximately 420 of the companys net revenue by distribution channel for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015 we expect online delivery of games and game offerings to become an increasing part of our business over the longterm 

product releases 

we released the following key titles in fiscal year 2015 



product pipeline 

we have announced the following key titles to date this list does not represent all titles currently in development 



fiscal 2015 financial summary 

our net revenue for fiscal year ended march 31 2015 was led by titles from a variety of our top franchises mainly grand theft auto  nba 2k borderlands and wwe 2k  our net revenue decreased to 10829 million a decrease of 12676 million or 539 from the fiscal year ended march 31 2014 which 

had benefitted from the release of grand theft auto v on sonys ps3 and microsofts xbox 360 console gaming systems 

for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015 our net loss was 2795 million as compared to net income of 3616 million in the prior year diluted loss per share for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015 was 348 as compared to diluted income per share of 320 for the fiscal year ended march 31 2014 our earnings decreased primarily because the prior year had benefitted from the release of grand theft auto v on sonys ps3 and microsofts xbox 360 console gaming systems and due to the deferral of net revenue and cost of goods sold related to the sellin of certain titles during the second half of our fiscal year ended march 31 2015 

at march 31 2015 we had 9111 million of cash and cash equivalents compared to 9354 million at march 31 2014 the decrease in cash and cash equivalents from march 31 2014 was primarily due to cash used in investing activities partially offset by cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities related to purchases of shortterm investments and purchases of fixed assets which were partially offset by the proceeds received from the sale of our longterm investments net cash provided by operations was primarily due to an increase in deferred revenue generated by the sale of grand theft auto v on sonys ps4 and microsofts xbox one platforms evolve and virtual currency partially offset by investments in software development 

discontinued operations 

the financial results of our former distribution business which was sold in february 2010 have been classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we base our estimates assumptions and judgments on historical experience current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared on a regular basis management reviews the accounting policies assumptions estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are fairly presented in accordance with us gaap however because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 

we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our financial results and they require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the effect and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 

revenue recognition 

we earn our revenue from the sale of internally developed interactive software titles and from the sale of titles developed by andor licensed from thirdparty developers 

we recognize revenue on the sales of software products upon the transfer of title and risk of loss to our customers accordingly we recognize revenue for software titles when there is 1 persuasive evidence that an arrangement with the customer exists which is generally based on a customer purchase order 2 the product is delivered 3 the selling price is fixed or determinable and 4 collection of the customer receivable is deemed probable certain products are sold to customers with a street date  ie the earliest date these products may be sold by retailers for these products we recognize revenue on the later of the street date or the sale date in addition some of our software products are sold as full game digital downloads and digital addon content for which the consumer takes possession of the digital content for a fee revenue from product downloads is generally recognized when the download is made available assuming all other recognition criteria are met 

in providing credit terms to our customers our payment arrangements typically provide net 30 and 60 day terms advances received for licensing and exclusivity arrangements are reported on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred revenue until we meet our performance obligations at which point we recognize the revenue 

for some of our software products we enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which we may provide a combination of full game software additional addon content hosting of gameplay maintenance or support when all other revenue recognition criteria are met we determine the fair value of each delivered and undelivered element using vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe of fair value and allocate the total price among the various elements when we have not established vsoe for each element revenue is deferred until the earlier of the point at which vsoe of fair value exists for any undelivered element or until all elements of the arrangement have been delivered for arrangements that require the deferral of revenue the cost of goods sold is deferred and recognized as the related net revenue is recognized deferred cost of goods sold includes product costs and licenses we determine vsoe for each element based on historical standalone sales to third parties in determining vsoe we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 

in identifying the deliverables within an arrangement we consider whether our software products contain morethaninconsequential online functionality by evaluating the significance of the development effort the nature of the online features the extent of anticipated marketing focus on the online features the significance of the online features to the consumers anticipated overall gameplay experience and the significance and length of time of our post sale obligations to consumers determining whether the online functionality for a particular game constitutes a more than inconsequential deliverable is subjective and requires managements judgment 

when our software products provide limited online functionality at no additional cost to the consumer we generally consider such features to be incidental to the overall product offering and an inconsequential deliverable and we recognize revenue when the four primary criteria described above have been met when software products provide online functionality that represents a morethaninconsequential deliverable we recognize the softwarerelated revenues and the related cost of goods sold ratably over the estimated service period of the title assuming all other recognition criteria are met as we have not established vsoe for that deliverable 

during the fiscal year ended march 31 2015 the company concluded that the updates being provided with grand theft auto v were no longer considered an inconsequential deliverable because addon content updates were expected to be provided beyond 12 months as a result the net revenue and cost of goods sold that have been deferred will be recognized ratably over the expected service period which is equal to the estimated remaining life of the game which for grand theft auto v we have projected to be 24 months from the time of release 

certain of our games provide consumers with the option to purchase virtual currency to use in the game to acquire virtual goods we recognize revenue from the sale of virtual currency using the gamebased model ratably over the estimated remaining life of the game 

certain of our software products include ingame advertising for thirdparty products advance payments received for ingame advertising are reported on our consolidated balance sheet as deferred revenue until we meet our performance obligations at which point we recognize the revenue which is generally at the time of the initial release of the product 

revenue is recognized after deducting estimated reserves for returns price concessions and other allowances in circumstances when we do not have a reliable basis to estimate returns and price concessions or are unable to determine that collection of a receivable is probable we defer the revenue until such time as we can reliably estimate any related returns and allowances and determine that collection of the receivable is probable 

allowances for returns price concessions and other allowances 

we accept returns and grant price concessions in connection with our publishing arrangements following reductions in the price of our products we grant price concessions to permit customers to take credits against amounts they owe us with respect to merchandise unsold by them our customers must satisfy certain conditions to entitle them to return products or receive price concessions including compliance with applicable payment terms and confirmation of field inventory levels 

generally our distribution arrangements with customers do not give them the right to return titles or to cancel firm orders however we occasionally accept returns from our customers for stock balancing and make accommodations to customers which include credits and returns when demand for specific titles falls below expectations 

we make estimates of future product returns and price concessions related to current period product revenue we estimate the amount of future returns and price concessions for published titles based upon among other factors historical experience and performance of the titles in similar genres historical performance of the hardware platform customer inventory levels analysis of sellthrough rates sales force and retail customer feedback industry pricing market conditions and changes in demand and acceptance of our products by consumers 

significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for returns and price concessions in any accounting period we believe we can make reliable estimates of returns and price concessions however actual results may differ from initial estimates as a result of changes in circumstances market conditions and assumptions adjustments to estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 

software development costs and licenses 

capitalized software development costs include direct costs incurred for internally developed titles and payments made to thirdparty software developers under development agreements 

we capitalize internal software development costs including stockbased compensation specifically identifiable employee payroll expense and incentive compensation costs related to the completion and release of titles thirdparty production and other content costs subsequent to establishing technological feasibility of a software title technological feasibility of a product includes the completion of both technical design documentation and game design documentation significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of when technological feasibility is established for products where proven technology exists this may occur early in the development cycle technological feasibility is evaluated on a product by product basis 

we enter into agreements with thirdparty developers that require us to make payments for game development and production services in exchange for our payments we receive the exclusive publishing and distribution rights to the finished game title as well as in some cases the underlying intellectual property rights such agreements typically allow us to fully recover these payments to the developers at an agreed upon royalty rate earned on the subsequent retail sales of such software net of any agreed upon costs prior to establishing technological feasibility of a product we record any costs incurred by thirdparty developers as research and development expenses subsequent to establishing technological feasibility of a product we capitalize all development and production service payments to thirdparty developers as software development costs and licenses we typically enter into agreements with thirdparty developers after completing the technical design documentation for our products and therefore record the design costs leading up to a signed development contract as research and development expense when we contract with thirdparty developers we generally select those that have proven technology and experience in the genre of the software being developed which often allows for the establishment of technological feasibility early in the development cycle in instances where the documentation of the design and technology are not in place prior to an executed contract we monitor the software development process and require our thirdparty developers to adhere to the same technological feasibility standards that apply to our internally developed products 

licenses consist of payments and guarantees made to holders of intellectual property rights for use of their trademarks copyrights or other intellectual property rights in the development of our products agreements with license holders generally provide for guaranteed minimum payments for use of their intellectual property 

certain licenses especially those related to our sports products extend over multiyear periods and encompass multiple game titles in addition to guaranteed minimum payments these licenses frequently contain provisions that could require us to pay royalties to the license holder based on preagreed unit sales thresholds 

amortization of capitalized software development costs and licenses commences when a product is released and is recorded on a titlebytitle basis in cost of goods sold for capitalized software development costs amortization is calculated using 1 the proportion of current year revenues to the total revenues expected to be recorded over the life of the title or 2 the straightline method over the remaining estimated useful life of the title whichever is greater for capitalized licenses amortization is calculated as a ratio of 1 current period revenues to the total revenues expected to be recorded over the remaining life of the title or 2 the contractual royalty rate based on actual net product sales as defined in the licensing agreement whichever is greater 

we evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized software development costs and licenses on a quarterly basis recoverability is primarily assessed based on the actual titles performance for products that are scheduled to be released in the future recoverability is evaluated based on the expected performance of the specific products to which the cost or license relates we utilize a number of criteria in evaluating expected product performance including historical performance of comparable products developed with comparable technology market performance of comparable titles orders for the product prior to its release general market conditions and past performance of the franchise when management determines that the value of the title is unlikely to be recovered by product sales capitalized costs are charged to cost of goods sold in the period in which such determination is made 

we have established profit and unit sales based internal royalty programs that allow selected employees to each participate in the success of software titles that they assist in developing royalties earned by employees under this program are recorded as a component of cost of goods sold in the period earned 

fair value estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap often requires us to determine the fair value of a particular item to fairly present our consolidated financial statements without an independent market or another representative transaction determining the fair value of a particular item requires us to make several assumptions that are inherently difficult to predict and can have a material influence on the conclusion of the appropriate accounting 

various valuation techniques are used to estimate fair value these include 1 the market approach where market transactions for identical or comparable assets or liabilities are used to determine the fair value 2 the income approach which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts for example future cash flows or future earnings to a single present amount and 3 the cost approach which is based on the amount that would be required to replace an asset for many of our fair value estimates including our estimates of the fair value of acquired intangible assets we use the income approach using the income approach requires the use of financial models which require us to make various estimates including but not limited to 1 the potential future cash flows for the asset liability or equity instrument being measured 2 the timing of receipt or payment of those future cash flows 3 the time value of money associated with the delayed receipt or payment of such cash flows and 4 the inherent risk associated with the cash flows risk premium developing these cash flow estimates is inherently difficult and subjective and if any of the estimates used to determine the fair value using the income approach turn out to be inaccurate our financial results may be negatively affected furthermore relatively small changes in many of these estimates can have a significant influence on the estimated fair value resulting from the financial models or the related accounting conclusion reached for example a relatively small change in the estimated fair value of an asset may change a conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired while we are required to make certain fair value assessments associated with the accounting for several types of transactions the following areas are the most sensitive to the assessments 

• business combinations—goodwill and intangible assets we must estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these can have a material effect on our reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various lives goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible assets and intangible assets acquired in a business combination a change in the estimated fair value of an acquired asset or liability assumed often has a direct influence on the amount recognized as goodwill which is an asset that is not amortized often determining the fair value of these acquired assets and liabilities assumed requires an assessment of expected use of the asset the expected cost to extinguish the liability or our expectations related to the timing and the successful completion of development of an acquired inprocess technology such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material influence on our financial statements we use either the income cost or market approach to aid in our conclusions of such fair values and asset lives the income approach presumes that the value of an asset can be estimated by the net economic benefit to be received over the life of the asset discounted to present value the cost approach presumes that an investor would pay no more for an asset than its replacement or reproduction cost the market approach estimates value based on what other participants in the market have paid for reasonably similar assets although each valuation approach is considered in valuing the assets acquired the approach ultimately selected is based on the characteristics of the asset and the availability of information 

we test our goodwill for impairment annually in our second fiscal quarter or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying amount a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment we have determined that we operate in one reporting unit which is our operating segment the determination of whether or not goodwill has become impaired involves a significant 

level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units changes in our strategy andor market conditions could significantly affect these judgments and require reductions to recorded intangible asset balances the company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the fair value of its reporting unit is more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than 50 less than its carrying value before performing the twostep impairment test if the twostep impairment test for goodwill is utilized step one compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value if the carrying value exceeds the fair value there is a potential impairment and step two must be performed step two compares the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill to its implied fair value ie fair value of reporting unit less the fair value of the units assets and liabilities including identifiable intangible assets if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount of goodwill an impairment is recognized based on our annual impairment assessment process for goodwill no impairments were recorded during the fiscal year ended march 31 2015 or 2014 

• longlived assets we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable determining whether impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions including determining which cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset the useful life over which cash flows will occur their amount and the assets residual value if any in turn measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value which is based on the best information available we use internal discounted cash flow estimates quoted market prices when available and independent appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value we derive the required cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans and apply an appropriate discount rate recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset with future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of the asset if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset • inventory obsolescence we regularly review inventory quantities onhand and in the retail channels and record an inventory provision for excess or obsolete inventory based on the future expected demand for our products significant changes in demand for our products would affect managements estimates in establishing our inventory provision we write down inventory based on excess or obsolete inventories determined primarily by future anticipated demand for our products inventory writedowns are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market value based upon assumptions about future demand that are inherently difficult to assess stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment in estimating expected stock volatility and the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 

we have also granted time performancebased and marketbased restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards to employees and nonemployees timebased and marketbased awards to nonemployees are subject to variable accounting for the timebased restricted stock awards to nonemployees we cumulatively remeasure the fair value at the end of every period based on the month end closing price of our common stock marketbased restricted stock awards vest based on the relative performance of our common stock to a composite index we calculate the fair value of marketbased restricted stock awards 

using a monte carlo simulation method which requires a substantial number of inputs and estimates of future market conditions and considers the range of various vesting probabilities as a result expense recorded for our nonemployee awards can fluctuate substantially from period to period 

income taxes 

we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred income taxes are recognized for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at currently enacted statutory tax rates for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized our history of pretax losses represents sufficient evidence for us to determine that the establishment of a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset is appropriate this valuation allowance offsets deferred tax assets associated with future tax deductions as well as carryforward items 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in addition our filed tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 

we recognize and measure uncertain tax positions and record tax benefits when it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

at each period end it is necessary for us to make certain estimates and assumptions to compute the provision for income taxes including allocations of certain transactions to different tax jurisdictions amounts of permanent and temporary differences the likelihood of deferred tax assets being recovered and the outcome of contingent tax risks these estimates and assumptions are revised as new events occur more experience is acquired and additional information is obtained the effect of these revisions is recorded in income tax expense or benefit in the period in which they become known 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

presentation of debt issuance costs 

in april 2015 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu 201503 simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs this new guidance requires the presentation of debt issuance costs in the balance sheet as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability this update will be applied retrospectively and is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2015 april 1 2016 for the company early adoption is permitted the adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

revenue from contracts with customers 

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 revenue from contracts with customers as a new topic accounting standards codification topic 606 the new revenue recognition standard provides a fivestep analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized the core principle is that a 

company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services this asu is effective for the annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2016 april 1 2017 for the company and shall be applied retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulativeeffect adjustment as of the date of adoption on april 1 2015 the fasb proposed deferring the effective date by one year to annual and interim years beginning after december 15 2017 the proposal permits early adoption but no earlier than the original effective date of annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2016 the company is currently determining its implementation approach and evaluating the impact of adopting this update on our consolidated financial statements 

requirements for reporting discontinued operations 

in april 2014 the fasb issued asu 201408 reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals of components of an entity this new guidance raises the threshold for a disposal to qualify as discontinued operations and requires new disclosures for individually material disposal transactions that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation under the new standard companies report discontinued operations when they have a disposal that represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major impact on operations or financial results this update will be applied prospectively and is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2014 april 1 2015 for the company early adoption is permitted provided the disposal was not previously disclosed the adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

presentation of unrecognized tax benefits 

in july 2013 new guidance was issued requiring that entities that have an unrecognized tax benefit and a net operating loss carryforward or similar tax loss or tax credit carryforward in the same jurisdiction as the uncertain tax position present the unrecognized tax benefit as a reduction of the deferred tax asset for the loss or tax credit carryforward rather than as a liability when the uncertain tax position would reduce the loss or tax credit carryforward under the tax law the disclosure requirements became effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after december 15 2013 april 1 2014 for the company and are applied prospectively the adoption of this guidance had no material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

fluctuations in operating results and seasonality 

we have experienced fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results as a result of the timing of the introduction of new titles variations in sales of titles developed for particular platforms market acceptance of our titles development and promotional expenses relating to the introduction of new titles sequels or enhancements of existing titles projected and actual changes in platforms the timing and success of title introductions by our competitors product returns changes in pricing policies by us and our competitors the size and timing of acquisitions the timing of orders from major customers order cancellations and delays in product shipment sales of our products are also seasonal with peak shipments typically occurring in the fourth calendar quarter as a result of increased demand for titles during the holiday season quarterly and annual comparisons of operating results are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of net revenue represented by certain line items in our statements of operations net revenue by geographic region net revenue by platform and net revenue by distribution channel 



fiscal years ended march 31 2015 and 2014 



1 includes 17121 and 30124 of stockbased compensation expense in 2015 and 2014 respectively 

net revenue decreased 12676 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015 as compared to the prior year this decrease was primarily due to a decrease of approximately 13153 million in sales from our grand theft auto franchise as the prior years results included the release of grand theft auto v on sonys ps3 and microsofts xbox 360 console gaming systems which was partially offset this year by the november 2014 release of grand theft auto v on sonys ps4 and microsofts xbox one console gaming systems and the growth from grand theft auto online  the decrease in net revenue from grand theft auto was partially offset by a 1863 million increase in net sales due to the october 2014 release of borderlands the presequel  higher sales from our wwe 2k franchise the release of sid meiers civilization beyond earth in october 2014 higher sales from our nba 2k franchise and sales from our release of evolve in february 2015 

net revenue on consoles decreased to 814 of our total net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015 as compared to 914 for the same period in the prior year primarily because last years results included the release of grand theft auto v on microsofts xbox 360 and sonys ps3 console gaming systems pc and other sales increased to 186 of our total net revenue for the year ended march 31 2015 as compared to 86 for the year ended march 31 2014 primarily due to the release of sid meiers civilization beyond earth for the pc in october 2014 net revenue from physical retail and other channels decreased to 580 of our total net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015 as compared to 842 for the same period in the prior year primarily due to last years net revenue from physical retail benefitting from the release of grand theft auto v on sonys ps3 and microsofts xbox 360 console gaming systems net revenue from digital online channels increased to 420 of our total net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015 as compared to 158 in the prior fiscal year recurrent consumer spending including addon content microtransactions and online play represented 494 and 404 of net revenue from digital online channels for the fiscal years ended march 31 2015 and 2014 respectively 

gross profit as a percentage of net revenue was 266 for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015 a decrease of 132 percentage points as compared to the prior year primarily due to higher software development costs and royalties as a percentage of net revenue and the deferral of net revenue and cost of goods sold related to sellin of certain titles during the second half of our fiscal year 2015 in addition internal royalties were higher as a percentage of net revenues due to the timing of when internal royalties are earned 

net revenue earned outside of the united states accounted for 425 of our total net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015 as compared to 535 in the prior year the yearoveryear percentage decrease was primarily due to grand theft auto v  which generated higher sales outside of the united states during the fiscal year ended march 31 2014 foreign currency exchange rates decreased net revenue by 144 million and decreased gross profit by 82 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015 

operating expenses

selling and marketing 

selling and marketing expenses decreased by 57 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015 as compared to the prior year primarily due to 207 million in higher advertising expenses incurred in the prior year for the releases of grand theft auto v on sonys ps3 and microsofts xbox 360 gaming consoles in september 2013 and the bureau xcom declassified in august 2013 which were partially offset by advertising expenses incurred in the current year for the releases of grand theft auto v on sonys ps4 and microsofts xbox one gaming consoles in november 2014 and borderlands the presequel and sid meiers civilization beyond earth in october 2014 partially offsetting the overall decrease in selling and marketing expenses was 82 million in higher customer service costs and 60 million of higher incentive compensation based on label performance 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses increased 137 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015 as compared to the prior year primarily due to 90 million of higher expense related to our compensation of zelnick media which was predominantly stock based compensation expense resulting from the companys relative stock price performance during fiscal year 2015 as well as 26 million of higher rent expense 

general and administrative expenses for the fiscal years ended march 31 2015 and 2014 include occupancy expense primarily rent utilities and office expenses of 179 million and 164 million respectively related to our development studios 

research and development 

research and development expenses increased 98 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015 as compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase of 39 million in it spend on equipment at our development studios higher personnel costs of 14 million higher studio support costs of 14 million and higher occupancy related costs of 13 million 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expenses increased 77 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015 as compared to the prior year primarily due to higher purchases of fixed assets for studio buildouts and information technology infrastructure 

interest and other net

gain on longterm investments net 

during the fiscal year ended march 31 2015 the company recognized a 175 million net gain on longterm investments which was primarily comprised of the companys sale of its investment in twitch interactive incs twitch class c preferred stock which was accounted for under the cost method of accounting in september 2014 the company recognized a pretax gain of 190 million in connection with the sale of twitch 

loss on extinguishment of debt

provision for income taxes 

income tax expense was 66 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015 as compared to 145 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2014 the decrease in income tax expense is primarily attributable to a decrease in net income our effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to changes in valuation allowances related to tax losses and tax credit carryforwards and due to the mix of earnings in our foreign entities which are taxed at a rate other than the us statutory rate of 35 our valuation allowances increased by 927 million during the fiscal year ended march 31 2015 and decreased by 921 million during the fiscal year ended march 31 2014 due to changes in net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 

as of march 31 2015 we had gross unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties of 427 million of which 292 million would affect our effective tax rate if realized for the fiscal year ended 

march 31 2015 gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by 178 million which primarily relates to an increase in uncertain tax position for certain tax credits in domestic jurisdictions 

we generally are no longer subject to audit for us federal income tax returns for periods prior to our fiscal year ended march 31 2011 and state income tax returns for periods prior to the fiscal year ended october 31 2010 with few exceptions we are no longer subject to income tax examinations in nonus jurisdictions for years prior to fiscal year ended october 31 2010 us federal taxing authorities have completed their audit through the fiscal years ended october 31 2009 certain us state taxing authorities are currently examining our income tax returns from fiscal years ended march 31 2011 through march 31 2013 the determination as to further adjustments to our gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months is not practicable 

we are regularly audited by domestic and foreign taxing authorities audits may result in tax assessments in excess of amounts claimed and the payment of additional taxes we believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable tax assessments 

net income loss and earnings loss per share 

for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015 our net loss was 2795 million as compared to net income of 3616 million in the prior year basic and diluted loss per share for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015 was 348 as compared to basic earnings per share of 379 and diluted earnings per share of 320 for the fiscal year ended march 31 2014 basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding were lower compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to the repurchase of 162 million shares during the fiscal year ended march 31 2014 and due to convertible notes shares being antidilutive in the current period partially offset by vesting of restricted stock awards see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding earnings loss per share 

fiscal years ended march 31 2014 and 2013 



1 includes 30124 and 10060 of stockbased compensation expense in 2014 and 2013 respectively 

net revenue increased 11361 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2014 as compared to the prior year this increase was primarily due to an increase of approximately 14815 million in sales from our grand theft auto franchise primarily related to the releases of grand theft auto v on sonys ps3 and microsofts xbox 360 and higher sales of 1395 million mainly driven by the october 2013 release of wwe 2k14 and higher sales of our nba 2k franchise these increases were partially offset by a 4460 million decrease in net sales as the prior year benefitted from the releases of borderlands 2 max payne 3 bioshock infinite xcom enemy unknown and spec ops the line

provision for income taxes 

income tax expense was 145 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2014 as compared to 51 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2013 the increase in tax expense was primarily attributable to an increase in pretax income from operations in excess of remaining net operating losses available in the fiscal year ended march 31 2014 our effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to changes in valuation allowances during the period our valuation allowances decreased by 921 million and 13 million during fiscal years ended march 31 2014 and 2013 respectively due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards from prior years against income earned during each year 

as of march 31 2014 we had gross unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties of 249 million of which 249 million would affect our effective tax rate if realized for the fiscal year ended march 31 2014 gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by 32 million we are generally no longer subject to audit for us federal income tax returns for periods prior to our fiscal year ended october 31 2010 and state income tax returns for periods prior to our fiscal year ended october 31 2007 with few exceptions we are no longer subject to income tax examinations in nonus jurisdictions for years prior to our fiscal year ended october 31 2010 us federal taxing authorities have completed their audit through the fiscal years ended october 31 2009 certain us state taxing authorities are currently examining our income tax returns from the fiscal years ended october 31 2007 through october 31 2010 the determination as to further adjustments to our gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months is not practicable 

we are regularly audited by domestic and foreign taxing authorities audits may result in tax assessments in excess of amounts claimed and the payment of additional taxes we believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable tax assessments

financial condition 

we are subject to credit risks particularly if any of our receivables represent a limited number of customers or are concentrated in foreign markets if we are unable to collect our accounts receivable as they become due it could adversely affect our liquidity and working capital position 

generally we have been able to collect our accounts receivable in the ordinary course of business we do not hold any collateral to secure payment from customers we have trade credit insurance on the majority of our customers to mitigate accounts receivable risk 

a majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to major retailers and distributors our five largest customers accounted for 646 394 and 525 of net revenue during the fiscal years ended march 31 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively as of march 31 2015 and 2014 five customers accounted for 639 and 683 of our gross accounts receivable respectively customers that individually accounted for more than 10 of our gross accounts receivable balance comprised 545 and 598 of such balances at march 31 2015 and 2014 respectively we had three customers who accounted for approximately 185 184 and 176 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2015 and three customers who accounted for 226 223 and 149 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2014 we did not have any additional customers that exceeded 10 of our gross accounts receivable as of march 31 2015 and 2014 based upon performing ongoing credit evaluations maintaining trade credit insurance on a majority of our customers and our past collection experience we believe that the receivable balances from these largest customers do not represent a significant credit risk although we actively monitor each customers credit worthiness and economic conditions that may affect our customers business and access to capital we are monitoring the current global economic conditions including credit markets and other factors as it relates to our customers in order to manage the risk of uncollectible accounts receivable 

we believe our current cash and cash equivalents and projected cash flow from operations along with availability under our credit agreement will provide us with sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash requirements for working capital capital expenditures and commitments through at least the next 12 months 

as of march 31 2015 the amount of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the us by our foreign subsidiaries was approximately 2910 million these balances are dispersed across various locations around the world we believe that such dispersion meets the business and liquidity needs of our foreign affiliates in addition the company expects in the foreseeable future to have the ability to generate sufficient cash domestically to support ongoing operations consequently it is the companys intention to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries in the event the company needed to repatriate funds outside of the us such repatriation may be subject to local laws and tax consequences including foreign withholding taxes or us income taxes it is not practicable to estimate the tax liability and the company would try to minimize the tax effect to the extent possible however any repatriation may not result in significant cash payments as the taxable event would likely be offset by the utilization of the then available tax credits 

in january 2013 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 7500000 shares of our common stock the authorization permits the company to purchase shares from time to time through a variety of methods including in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws it does not obligate the company to make any purchases at any specific time or situation repurchases are subject to the availability of stock prevailing market conditions the trading price of the stock the companys financial performance and other conditions the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time for any reason the company did not repurchase any shares during fiscal year ended march 31 2015 during the fiscal year ended march 31 2014 the company repurchased approximately 4217000 shares of our common stock in the open market for approximately 733 million including commissions of approximately 004 million as part of the program as of march 31 2015 up to approximately 3283000 shares of our common stock remain available for repurchase under the companys share repurchase authorization on may 13 2015 our board of directors approved an increase to the share repurchase authorization increasing the total number of shares that the company is permitted to repurchase to up to 10000000 shares of our common stock 

our changes in cash flows were as follows 



at march 31 2015 we had 9111 million of cash and cash equivalents compared to 9354 million at march 31 2014 the decrease in cash and cash equivalents from march 31 2014 was primarily due to cash being used in investing activities partially offset by cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities related to purchases of shortterm investments and purchases of fixed assets and was partially offset by the proceeds received from the sale of our longterm investment net cash provided by operations was primarily due to cash generated from the sale of grand theft auto v on sonys ps4 and microsofts xbox one platforms the sale of evolve and the sale virtual currency partially offset by investments in software development and licenses 

contractual obligations and commitments 

we have entered into various agreements in the ordinary course of business that require substantial cash commitments over the next several years generally these include 

• software development and licensing we make payments to thirdparty software developers that include contractual payments to developers under several software development agreements that expire at various times through september 2019 our aggregate outstanding software development commitments assume satisfactory performance by thirdparty software developers we also have licensing commitments that primarily consist of obligations to holders of intellectual property rights for use of their trademarks copyrights technology or other intellectual property rights in the development of our products • marketing we have certain minimum marketing support commitments where we commit to spend specified amounts related to marketing our products marketing commitments expire at various times through september 2019 • operating leases our offices are occupied under noncancelable operating leases expiring at various times through june 2024 we also lease certain furniture equipment and automobiles under noncancelable leases expiring through fiscal year 2020 some of the leases have fixed rent increases and also include inducements to enter into the lease the effect of such amounts are deferred and recognized on a straightline basis over the related lease term • purchase obligations primarily related to agreements to purchase services that are enforceable and legally binding on the company that specifies all significant terms including fixed minimum or variable pricing provisions and the approximate timing of the transactions expiring at various times through march 2019 a summary of annual minimum contractual obligations and commitments as of march 31 2015 is as follows in thousands of dollars 



in addition to the cash commitments above we have also entered into acquisition agreements that contain provisions for us to pay contingent cash consideration typically contingent on the acquired company achieving certain financial unit sales or performance conditions the amount and timing of these payments are currently not fixed or determinable see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our potential acquisition commitments 

income taxes at march 31 2015 the company had recorded a liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties of 292 million for which we are unable to make a reasonable and reliable estimate of the period in which these liabilities will be settled with the respective tax authorities therefore these liabilities have not been included in the contractual obligations table 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of march 31 2015 and 2014 we did not have any material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial parties such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such we are not exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 

international operations 

net revenue earned outside of the united states is principally generated by our operations in europe asia australia canada and latin america for the fiscal years ended march 31 2015 2014 and 2013 approximately 425 535 and 415 respectively of our net revenue was earned outside the united states we are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade including increased credit risks tariffs and duties fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates shipping delays and international political regulatory and economic developments all of which can have a significant effect on our operating results 

fluctuations in quarterly operating results and seasonality 

we have experienced fluctuations in quarterly operating results as a result of the timing of the introduction of new titles variations in sales of titles developed for particular platforms market acceptance of our titles development and promotional expenses relating to the introduction of new titles sequels or enhancements of existing titles projected and actual changes in platforms the timing and success of title introductions by our competitors product returns changes in pricing policies by us and our competitors the accuracy of retailers forecasts of consumer demand the size and timing of acquisitions the timing of orders from major customers and order cancellations and delays in product shipment sales of our titles are also seasonal with peak shipments typically occurring in the fourth calendar quarter as a result of increased demand for titles during the holiday season quarterly comparisons of operating results are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential loss arising from fluctuations in market rates and prices our market risk exposures primarily include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

historically fluctuations in interest rates have not had a significant effect on our operating results under our credit agreement outstanding balances bear interest at our election of a 050 to 100 above a certain base rate 375 at march 31 2015 or b 150 to 200 above the libor rate approximately 176 at march 31 2015 with the margin rate subject to the achievement of certain average liquidity levels changes in market rates may affect our future interest expense if there is an outstanding balance on our line of credit the 175 convertible notes and the 100 convertible notes pay interest semiannually at a fixed rate of 175 and 100 respectively per annum and we expect that there will be no fluctuation related to the convertible notes affecting our cash component of interest expense for additional details on our convertible notes see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we transact business in foreign currencies and are exposed to risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates accounts relating to foreign operations are translated into united states dollars using prevailing exchange rates at the relevant period end translation adjustments are included as a separate component of stockholders equity for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015 and 2014 our foreign currency translation adjustment was approximately 327 million loss and 64 million gain respectively we recognized a foreign currency exchange transaction loss of 21 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015 a foreign currency gain of 02 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2014 and a foreign currency exchange transaction loss for the fiscal year ended march 31 2013 of 08 million in interest and other net in our consolidated statements of operations 

cash flow hedging activities 

we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with forecasted transactions involving nonfunctional currency denominated expenditures these contracts which are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts is reported as either assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets the effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these hedges is initially reported net of tax as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity the gross amount of the effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these hedges is subsequently reclassified into cost of goods sold or research and development expenses as appropriate in the period when the forecasted transaction is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations in the event that the gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income loss are deemed to be ineffective the ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value if any is reclassified to interest and other net in our consolidated statements of operations in the event that the underlying forecasted transactions do not occur or it becomes probable that they will not occur within the defined hedge period the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income loss to interest and other net in our consolidated statements of operations during the reporting periods presented all forecasted transactions occurred and therefore there were no such gains or losses reclassified into interest and other net we do not enter into derivative financial contracts for speculative or trading purposes at march 31 2015 we did not have cash flow hedging contracts outstanding and at march 31 2014 we had 09 million of forward contracts outstanding to buy foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars all of which had maturities of less than one year as of march 31 2014 the fair value of these outstanding forward contracts was immaterial and is 

included in prepaid expenses and other the fair value of these outstanding forward contracts is estimated based on the prevailing exchange rates of the various hedged currencies as of the end of the period 

balance sheet hedging activities 

we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with nonfunctional currency denominated cash balances and intercompany funding loans nonfunctional currency denominated accounts receivable and nonfunctional currency denominated accounts payable these transactions are not designated as hedging instruments and are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts is reported as either assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value are reported in interest and other net in our consolidated statements of operations we do not enter into derivative financial contracts for speculative or trading purposes at march 31 2015 we had 41 million of forward contracts outstanding to buy foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars and 725 million of forward contracts outstanding to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars all of which have maturities of less than one year at march 31 2014 we had 685 million of forward contracts outstanding to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars all of which have maturities of less than one year for the fiscal years ended march 31 2015 2014 and 2013 we recorded a gain of 185 million a loss of 184 million and a gain of 22 million respectively related to foreign currency forward contracts in interest and other net on the consolidated statements of operations as of march 31 2015 the fair value of these outstanding forward contracts was a loss of 06 million and as of march 31 2014 was immaterial and is included in prepaid expenses and other the fair value of these outstanding forward contracts is estimated based on the prevailing exchange rates of the various hedged currencies as of the end of the period 

our hedging programs are designed to reduce but do not entirely eliminate the effect of currency exchange rate movements we believe the counterparties to these foreign currency forward contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks and that the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risks there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations for the fiscal year ended march 31 2015 425 of the companys revenue was generated outside the united states using sensitivity analysis a hypothetical 10 increase in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would decrease revenues by 43 while a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would increase revenues by 43 in the opinion of management a substantial portion of this fluctuation would be offset by cost of goods sold and operating expenses incurred in local currency

support label structure to target distinct market segments our business consists of our whollyowned labels rockstar games and 2k rockstar games is the developer and publisher of the interactive entertainment industrys most iconic and critically acclaimed brand grand theft auto  as well as other successful franchises including la noire  max payne  midnight club  and red dead  we expect rockstar games to continue to be a leader in the action  adventure product category and create groundbreaking entertainment by leveraging our existing franchises as well as developing new brands 2k publishes highquality owned and licensed titles across a range of genres including shooter action roleplaying strategy sports and familycasual 2k is the publisher of a number of critically acclaimed multimillion unit selling franchises including bioshock  borderlands  carnival games  mafia  nba 2k  sid meiers civilization  wwe 2k and xcom  we expect 2k to continue to be a leader by building on its existing brands as well as developing new franchises in the future we also have expansion initiatives in the asia markets where our strategy is to broaden the distribution of our existing products expand our business in japan and establish an online gaming presence especially in china and south korea 

focus on core strength of producing select high quality titles we focus on publishing a select number of highquality titles based on internally owned and developed intellectual property which typically provide higher margins than licensed products we currently own the intellectual property rights of 20 proprietary brands in addition we will selectively develop titles based on licensed properties including sports and also publish externally developed titles 

we use a product investment review process to evaluate potential titles for investment to review existing titles in development and to assess titles after release to measure their performance in the market and the return on our investment we apply this process to all of our products whether internally or externally developed the product investment review process includes reviews of each project at various stages of development by our executive management team and senior management of our publishing labels and includes coordination between our sales and marketing personnel before the launch of the titles this disciplined approach to product investment is expected to enhance the competitiveness and profitability of our titles 

we develop our products using a combination of our internal and external development resources acting under contract with us we typically select our external developers based on their track record and expertise in developing products in the same category or genre one developer will generally produce the same game for multiple platforms and will also produce sequels to an original game we believe that selecting and using development resources in this manner allows us to leverage the particular expertise of our internal and external development resources which we believe increases the quality of our products 

leverage emerging technologies platforms and distribution channels including digitally delivered content interactive entertainment played on mobile platforms including tablets and smartphones and online platforms including social networks represent exciting opportunities to enhance our growth and profitability in addition the interactive entertainment software industry is delivering a growing amount of content for traditional platforms through digital download on the internet we provide a variety of online delivered products and offerings a number of our titles that are available through retailers as packaged goods products are also available through direct digital download on the internet from thirdparty websites we aim to drive recurrent consumer spending by generating incremental revenues from our titles through downloadable offerings including addon content microtransactions and online play in addition we are publishing an expanding variety of titles for tablets and smartphones which are delivered to consumers through digital download through the internet we will continue to invest in emerging opportunities in mobile and online gameplay particularly for our whollyowned franchises as well as downloadable content and microtransactions where gamers can pay to download additional content to enhance their game playing experience

have expansion initiatives in the asian markets where our strategy is to broaden the distribution of our existing products expand our business in japan and establish an online gaming presence especially in china and south korea we are a direct publisher in japan and south korea historically we distributed our products in asia through license agreements with local publishers in japan and south korea and distribution agreements with local distributors of finished goods elsewhere in asia while we retain title to all intellectual property under license agreements local publishers are responsible for localization of software content distribution and marketing of the products in their respective local markets we intend to continue to build upon our licensing relationships and also expand finished goods distribution strategies to grow our international business 

our businesses 

our revenue is primarily derived from the sale of internally developed software titles and software titles developed by thirdparties for our benefit operating margins are dependent in part upon our ability to continually release new commercially successful products and to manage software product development costs we have internal development studios located in australia canada china czech republic the united kingdom and the united states as of march 31 2014 we had a research and development staff of approximately 1860 employees with the technical capabilities to develop software titles for all major current and prior generation consoles handheld hardware platforms and pcs in multiple languages and territories 

agreements with thirdparty developers generally give us exclusive publishing and marketing rights and require us to make development payments pay royalties based on product sales and satisfy other conditions development payments for software titles are typically recoupable against royalties otherwise due to developers based on software sales our agreements with thirdparty developers generally provide us with the right to monitor development efforts and to cease making development payments if specified development milestones are not satisfied we also regularly monitor the level of development payments in light of expected sales for the related titles 

we continue to explore evolving business models such as downloadable content online gaming and microtransactions we expect growth and incremental revenue opportunities through addon content microtransactions and online play we also have expansion initiatives in the asia markets where our strategy is to broaden the distribution of our existing products expand our business in japan and establish an online gaming presence especially in china and south korea

we are dependent on a limited number of customers that account for a significant portion of our sales sales to our five largest customers during the fiscal year ended march 31 2014 accounted for approximately 394 of our net revenue with gamestop accounting for 184 no other customer accounted for more than 100 of our net revenue during the fiscal year ended march 31 2014 

we also digitally distribute our titles addon content and microtransactions direct to consoles and pcs including smartphones and tablets we view digital distribution as an important growth opportunity for our industry and company however we continue to expect that packaged goods and traditional retailers will be the primary channel for the sale of our products for the foreseeable future 

marketing 

our marketing and promotional efforts are intended to maximize consumer interest in our titles promote brand name recognition of our franchises assist retailers and properly position package and merchandise our titles from time to time we also receive marketing support from hardware manufacturers in connection with their own promotional efforts 

we market titles by 

• implementing public relations campaigns using print and online advertising television radio spots and outdoor advertising we believe that we label and market our products in accordance with the 6 

applicable principles and guidelines of the entertainment software rating board or the esrb an independent selfregulatory body that assigns ratings and enforces advertising guidelines for the interactive software industry 

• satisfying certain shelf life and sales requirements under our agreements with hardware manufacturers in order to qualify for sonys greatest hits programs and microsofts platinum hits program in connection with these programs we receive manufacturing discounts from sony and microsoft • stimulating continued sales by reducing the wholesale prices of our products to retailers at various times during the life of a product price concessions may occur at any time in a products life cycle but typically occur three to nine months after a products initial launch in certain international markets we also provide volume rebates to stimulate continued product sales sales returns price protection and other allowances amounted to 1381 million 1091 million and 1195 million during the fiscal years ended march 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively • employing various other marketing methods designed to promote consumer awareness including social media instore promotions and pointofpurchase displays direct mail cooperative advertising attendance at trade shows as well as product sampling through demonstration software distributed through the internet or the digital online services in addition to our media retail and public relations campaigns an important part of our marketing strategy leverages evolving business models such as downloadable addon content and online play for our front line titles addon content and online play generate incremental revenues and also helps to prolong consumer engagement with our titles which extends the life of each new release and enhances the value of our franchises as of march 31 2014 we had a sales and marketing staff of approximately 320 people 

product procurement 

we procure products from suppliers principally using standard purchase orders based on our assessment of market demand we carry inventory quantities that we believe are necessary to provide rapid response to retailer orders we utilize electronic data interchange with many of our customers to enhance the efficiency of placing and shipping orders and receiving payments 

competition 

in our business we compete with 

• companies that range in size and cost structure from very small with limited resources to very large companies with greater financial marketing and technical personnel and other resources than ours including activision blizzard electronic arts and international companies such as capcom sega square enix and ubisoft • sony microsoft and nintendo for the sale of interactive entertainment software each of these competitors is a large developer and marketer of software for their own platforms and has the financial resources to withstand significant price competition and to implement extensive advertising campaigns • other software hardware entertainment and media for limited retail shelf space and promotional resources the competition is intense among an increasing number of newly introduced entertainment software titles and hardware for adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support • other forms of entertainment such as motion pictures television and audio social networking online computer programs mobile games and other forms of entertainment which may be less expensive or provide other advantages to consumers 7 

competition in the entertainment software industry is based on innovation features playability and product quality brand name recognition compatibility with popular platforms access to distribution channels price marketing and customer service our business is driven by hit titles which require increasing budgets for development and marketing competition for our titles is influenced by the timing of competitive product releases and the similarity of such products to our titles and may result in loss of shelf space or a reduction in sellthrough of our titles at retail stores 

trends and factors affecting our business 

product release schedule our financial results are affected by the timing of our product releases and the commercial success of those titles our grand theft auto products in particular have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue sales of grand theft auto products generated approximately 689 of the companys net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2014 the timing of our grand theft auto releases varies significantly which in turn may affect our financial performance on a quarterly and annual basis 

economic environment and retailer performance we continue to monitor economic conditions that may unfavorably affect our businesses such as deteriorating consumer demand pricing pressure on our products credit quality of our receivables and foreign currency exchange rates our business is dependent upon a limited number of customers who account for a significant portion of our revenue our five largest customers accounted for 394 525 and 439 of net revenue during the fiscal years ended march 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively as of march 31 2014 and 2013 five customers comprised approximately 683 and 572 of our gross accounts receivable respectively with our significant customers those that individually comprised more than 10 of our gross accounts receivable balance accounting for approximately 598 and 305 of such balance at march 31 2014 and 2013 respectively the economic environment has affected our customers in the past and may do so in the future bankruptcies or consolidations of our large retail customers could seriously hurt our business due to uncollectible accounts receivables and the concentration of purchasing power among the remaining large retailers certain of our large customers sell used copies of our games which may negatively affect our business by reducing demand for new copies of our games while the downloadable content that we now offer for certain of our titles may serve to reduce used game sales we expect used game sales to continue to adversely affect our business 

hardware platforms we derive most of our revenue from the sale of products made for video game platforms manufactured by thirdparties such as sonys ps3 and ps4 microsofts xbox 360 and xbox one and nintendos wii which comprised approximately 914 of the companys net revenue by product platform for the fiscal year ended march 31 2014 the success of our business is dependent upon the consumer acceptance of these platforms and the continued growth in the installed base of these platforms when new hardware platforms are introduced demand for software based on older platforms typically declines which may negatively affect our business during the market transition to the new consoles additionally our development costs are generally higher for titles during platform transition periods and we have limited ability to predict the consumer acceptance of the new platforms which may affect our sales and profitability accordingly our strategy is to focus our development efforts on a select number of the highest quality titles for these platforms while also expanding our offerings for emerging platforms such as mobile and online games 

online content and digital distribution the interactive entertainment software industry is delivering a growing amount of content through digital online delivery methods we provide a variety of online delivered products and offerings a number of our titles that are available through retailers as packaged goods products are also available through direct digital download through the internet from websites we own and others owned by thirdparties we aim to drive recurrent consumer spending by generating incremental revenues from our titles through downloadable offerings including addon content 

microtransactions and online play in addition we are publishing an expanding variety of titles for tablets and smartphones which are delivered to consumers through digital download through the internet note 14 to our consolidated financial statements segment and geographic information discloses that net revenue from digital online channels comprised approximately 158 of the companys net revenue by distribution channel for the fiscal year ended march 31 2014 we expect online delivery of games and game offerings to become an increasing part of our business over the longterm 

international operations 

international sales are a significant part of our business for the fiscal years ended march 31 2014 2013 and 2012 approximately 535 415 and 456 respectively of our net revenue was earned outside the united states we have also expanded our asian operations in an effort to increase our geographical scope and diversify our revenue base we are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade including increased credit risks tariffs and duties fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates shipping delays and international political regulatory and economic developments all of which can have a significant effect on our operating results see notes 1 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements

employees 

as of march 31 2014 we had approximately 2530 fulltime employees of which approximately 1190 were employed outside of the united states none of our employees is subject to collective bargaining agreements we consider our relations with employees to be satisfactory 




 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties which may affect our future financial performance because of the risks and uncertainties described below as well as other factors affecting our operating results and financial condition past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and our business and financial performance could be harmed and the market value of our securities could decline 

risks relating to our business 

we are dependent on the future success of our grand theft auto products and we must continue to publish hit titles or sequels to such hit titles in order to compete successfully in our industry 

grand theft auto and certain of our other titles are hit products and have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue sales of grand theft auto products generated approximately 689 of the companys net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2014 and the ten bestselling franchises including grand theft auto  that significantly contributed to the companys net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2014 in the aggregate accounted for approximately 983 of the companys net revenue if we fail to continue to develop and sell new commercially successful hit titles or sequels to such hit titles or experience any delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of our hit titles or their sequels our revenue and profits may decrease substantially and we may incur losses in addition competition in our industry is intense and a relatively small number of hit titles account for a large portion of total revenue in our industry hit products offered by our competitors may take a larger share of consumer spending than we anticipate which could cause revenue generated from our products to fall below our expectations if our competitors develop more successful products or services at lower price points or based on payment models perceived as offering better value or if we do not continue to develop consistently high quality and wellreceived products and services our revenue and profitability may decline in addition both the online and mobile games marketplaces are characterized by frequent product introductions relatively low barriers to entry and new and evolving business methods technologies and platforms for development widespread consumer adoption of these new platforms for games and other technological advances in online or mobile game offerings could negatively affect our sales of console and traditional pc products before we have an opportunity to develop profitable businesses in such markets 

we are subject to product development risks which could result in delays and additional costs and we must adapt to changes in software technologies 

we depend on our internal development studios and thirdparty software developers to develop new interactive entertainment software within anticipated release schedules and cost projections the development cycle for new titles generally ranges from 12 to more than 24 months and our topselling titles could take more than 3 years to develop therefore our development costs can be substantial if we or our third party developers experience unanticipated development delays financial difficulties or additional costs we may not be able to release titles according to our schedule and at budgeted costs there can be no assurance that our products will be sufficiently successful so that we can recoup these costs or make a profit on these products 

additionally in order to stay competitive our internal development studios must anticipate and adapt to rapid technological changes affecting software development any inability to respond to technological advances and implement new technologies could render our products obsolete or less marketable 

the inability of our products to achieve significant market acceptance delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of our products may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

new products may not achieve significant market acceptance generate sufficient sales or be introduced in a timely manner to permit us to recover development manufacturing and marketing costs associated with these products the life cycle of a title generally involves a relatively high level of sales during the first few months after introduction followed by a rapid decline in sales because revenue associated with an initial product launch generally constitutes a high percentage of the total revenue associated with the life of a product delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of one or more new products could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results and cause our operating results to be materially different from our expectations 

our business is subject to our ability to develop commercially successful products for the current generation video game platforms and our ability to transition our business model and strategy to the next generation platforms 

we derive most of our revenue from the sale of products made for video game platforms manufactured by thirdparties such as sonys ps3 and ps4 microsofts xbox 360 and xbox one and nintendos wii which comprised approximately 914 of the companys net revenue by product platform for the fiscal year ended march 31 2014 the success of our business is subject to the continued popularity of these platforms and our ability to develop commercially successful products for these platforms 

video game hardware platforms have historically had a life cycle of four to six years and are experiencing a transition to new console platforms during any such transitional period our success will depend on our ability to develop our products and services for these nextgeneration consoles this transition may require significant costs and management resources there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully transition our business model and strategy to these new platforms further the hardware manufacturers are not required to enter into agreements with us with respect to new consoles and these manufacturers may choose to impose more restrictive terms or adopt very different business models and fee structures in addition the demand for nextgeneration consoles may not grow as rapidly as the decline of the previous generation consoles as a result the transition to new platforms could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

connectivity issues related to digital delivery platforms could affect our ability to sell and provide online services for our products and could affect our profitability 

we rely upon thirdparty digital delivery platforms such as steam microsofts xbox live and sony entertainment network to provide connectivity from the consumer to our digital products and our online services connectivity issues could prevent customers from accessing this content and our ability to successfully market and sell our products could be adversely affected in addition we could experience similar issues related to services we host on our internal servers such issues also could affect our ability to provide online services and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

our business could be adversely affected if our consumer data protection measures are not seen as adequate or there are breaches of our security measures or unintended disclosures of our consumer data 

we are collecting and storing consumer information including personal information and credit card information we take measures to protect our consumer data from unauthorized access or disclosure it is possible that our security controls over consumer data may not prevent the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information in addition due to the high profile nature of our products we may draw a disproportionately higher amount of attention and attempts to breach our security controls than companies with lower profile products a security breach that leads to disclosure of consumer account 

information including personally identifiable information could harm our reputation compel us to comply with disparate breach notification laws in various jurisdictions and otherwise subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue a resulting perception that our products or services do not adequately protect the privacy of personal information could result in a loss of current or potential consumers and business partners in addition if any of our business partners experience a security breach that leads to disclosure of consumer account information our reputation could be harmed resulting in loss of revenue 

the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the us europe and elsewhere are often uncertain contradictory and in flux it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices if so this could result in government imposed fines or orders requiring that we change our data practices which could have an adverse effect on our business complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business financial condition and operating results 

in addition certain of our products are onlineenabled the ability of our products to offer online functionality and our ability to offer content through a video game platforms digital distribution channel is dependent upon the continued operation and security of such platforms online network these third party networks as well as our own internal systems and websites and the security measures related thereto may be breached as a result of thirdparty action including intentional misconduct by computer hackers employee error malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers data or our data including our intellectual property and other confidential business information or our information technology systems because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs we may lose business suffer irreparable damage to our reputation andor incur significant costs and expenses relating to the investigation and possible litigation of claims relating to such event 

security breaches involving the source code for our products could adversely affect our business 

we securely store the source code for our interactive entertainment software products as it is created a breach whether physical electronic or otherwise of the systems on which such source code and other sensitive data are stored could lead to damage or piracy of our software if we are subject to data security breaches we may have a loss in sales or increased costs arising from the restoration or implementation of additional security measures which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results any theft andor unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an event could adversely affect our competitive position reputation brand and future sales of our products our business could be subject to significant disruption and we could suffer monetary and other losses and reputational harm in the event of such incidents and claims 

our efforts to expand into new products and services may subject us to additional risks 

in recent years we have invested in emerging opportunities in interactive entertainment played on mobile platforms including tablets and smartphones and online platforms including social networks we have also grown our product offerings that are available through digital download we are actively investing to capitalize on these trends in order to diversify our product mix reduce our operating risks and increase our revenue there are risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed there is no assurance that we will be able to attract a sufficiently large number of customers or recover costs incurred for developing and marketing these new products or services external factors such as competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also 

impact the successful implementation of any new products or services failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we depend on our key management and product development personnel 

our continued success will depend to a significant extent on our senior management team and our relationship with zelnickmedia corporation zelnickmedia our executive chairman and chief executive officer and president are partners of zelnickmedia we are also highly dependent on the expertise skills and knowledge of certain of our rockstar employees and other key creative personnel responsible for content creation and development of our grand theft auto titles and titles based on other brands we may not be able to continue to retain these personnel at current compensation levels or at all 

the loss of the services of our executive officers zelnickmedia our key rockstar employees or other key creative personnel could significantly harm our business in addition if one or more key employees were to join a competitor or form a competing company we may lose additional personnel experience material interruptions in product development delays in bringing products to market and difficulties in our relationships with licensors suppliers and customers which would significantly harm our business failure to continue to attract and retain other qualified management and creative personnel could adversely affect our business and prospects 

declines in consumer spending and other adverse changes in the economy could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

most of our products involve discretionary spending on the part of consumers we believe that consumer spending is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income this makes our products particularly sensitive to general economic conditions and economic cycles as consumers are generally more willing to make discretionary purchases including purchases of products like ours during periods in which favorable economic conditions prevail adverse economic conditions such as a prolonged us or international general economic downturn including periods of increased inflation unemployment levels tax rates interest rates energy prices or declining consumer confidence could also reduce consumer spending reduced consumer spending has and may continue to result in reduced demand for our products and may also require increased selling and promotional expenses which has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results in addition during periods of relative economic weakness our consolidated credit risk reflecting our counterparty dealings with distributors customers capital providers and others may increase perhaps materially so furthermore uncertainty and adverse changes in the economy could also increase the risk of material losses on our investments increase costs associated with developing and publishing our products increase the cost and availability of sources of financing and increase our exposure to material losses from bad debts any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results if economic conditions worsen our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 

changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and in various other jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of business there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are required to estimate future taxes although we currently believe our tax estimates are reasonable the estimate process is inherently uncertain and such estimates are not binding on tax authorities further our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by a variety of factors including changes in the business including the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in tax elections and 

changes in applicable tax laws additionally tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities and developments in those audits could adversely affect our income tax provision should the ultimate tax liability exceed estimates our income tax provision and net income or loss could be adversely affected 

historically we recorded a valuation allowance against most of our us deferred tax assets we expect to provide a valuation allowance on future us tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability or until other significant positive evidence arises that suggest that these benefits are more likely than not to be realized further our tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities and developments in those audits could adversely affect our income tax provision should our ultimate tax liability exceed our estimates our income tax provision and net income or loss could be materially affected 

we earn a significant amount of our operating income and hold a significant portion of our cash outside the us any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions may result in higher effective tax rates for the company in addition there have been proposals to change us tax laws that would significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings although we cannot predict whether or in what form this proposed legislation will pass if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our income tax provision and financial condition 

we are also required to pay taxes other than income taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the us and foreign jurisdictions we are regularly under examination by tax authorities with respect to these nonincome taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations changes in our business or changes in applicable tax rules will not have an adverse effect on our net income or loss and financial condition 

our quarterly operating results are dependent on the release of hit titles and are highly seasonal which may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate significantly 

we have experienced and may continue to experience wide fluctuations in quarterly operating results the release of a hit title typically leads to a high level of sales during the first few months after introduction followed by a rapid decline in sales in addition the interactive entertainment industry is highly seasonal with sales typically higher during the fourth calendar quarter due primarily to increased demand for games during the holiday season demand for and sales of our sports titles are also seasonal in that they are typically released just prior to the start of the sport season which they depict if a key event or sports season to which our product release schedule is tied were to be delayed or cancelled our sales would also suffer disproportionately our failure or inability to produce hit titles or introduce products on a timely basis to meet seasonal fluctuations in demand could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results the uncertainties associated with software development manufacturing lead times production delays and the approval process for products by hardware manufacturers and other licensors make it difficult to predict the quarter in which our products will ship and therefore may cause us to fail to meet financial expectations 

returns of our published titles by our customers and price concessions granted to our customers may adversely affect our operating results 

we are exposed to the risk of product returns and price concessions with respect to our customers our distribution arrangements with customers generally do not give them the right to return titles to us or to cancel firm orders however we sometimes accept product returns from our distribution customers for stock balancing and negotiate accommodations for customers which include credits and returns when demand for specific products falls below expectations we accept returns and grant price concessions in connection with our publishing arrangements and revenue is recognized after deducting estimated reserves for returns and price concessions while we believe that we can reliably estimate future returns and price concessions if return rates and price concessions for our products exceed our reserves our revenue could 

decline which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

increased sales of used video game products could lower our sales 

certain of our larger customers sell used video games which are generally priced lower than new video games if our customers increase their sales of used video games it could negatively affect our sales of new video games and have an adverse influence on our business financial condition and operating results 

a limited number of customers account for a significant portion of our sales the loss of a principal customer or other significant business relationship could seriously hurt our business 

a substantial portion of our product sales are made to a limited number of customers sales to our five largest customers during the fiscal year ended march 31 2014 accounted for approximately 394 of our net revenue with gamestop accounting for 184 our sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders without longterm agreements or other commitments and our customers may terminate their relationship with us at any time certain of our customers may decline to carry products containing mature content the loss of our relationships with principal customers or a decline in sales to principal customers including as a result of a product being rated ao age 18 and over could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

furthermore our customers may also be placed into bankruptcy become insolvent or be liquidated due to economic downturns global contractions of credit or for other factors bankruptcies or consolidations of certain large retail customers could seriously hurt our business including as a result of uncollectible accounts receivable from such customers and the concentration of purchasing power among remaining large retailers in addition our results of operations may be adversely affected if certain of our customers who purchase on credit terms are no longer eligible to purchase on such terms due to their financial distress which may reduce the quantity of products they demand from us 

if our marketing and advertising efforts fail to resonate with our customers our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 

our products are marketed worldwide through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs such as television and online advertising print advertising retail merchandising website development and event sponsorship our ability to sell our products and services is dependent in part on the success of these programs if the marketing for our products and services fails to resonate with our customers particularly during the holiday season or other key selling periods or if advertising rates or other media placement costs increase these factors could have a material adverse influence on our business financial condition and operating results 

the interactive entertainment software industry is highly competitive 

we compete for both licenses to properties and the sale of interactive entertainment software with sony microsoft and nintendo each of which is a large developer and marketer of software for its own platforms we also compete with domestic game publishers such as activision blizzard and electronic arts and international publishers such as capcom sega square enix and ubisoft as our business is dependent upon our ability to develop hit titles which require increasing budgets for development and marketing the availability of significant financial resources has become a major competitive factor in developing and marketing software games some of our competitors have greater financial technical personnel and other resources than we do and are able to finance larger budgets for development and marketing and make higher offers to licensors and developers for commercially desirable properties our titles also compete with other forms of entertainment such as social media and casual games in addition to motion pictures 

television and audio and video products featuring similar themes online computer programs and other entertainment which may be less expensive or provide other advantages to consumers 

a number of software publishers who compete with us have developed and commercialized or are currently developing online games for use by consumers over the internet if technological advances significantly increase the availability of online games and if consumer acceptance of online gaming grows substantially it could result in a decline in our platformbased software sales and negatively affect sales of such products 

increased competition for limited shelf space and promotional support from retailers could affect the success of our business and require us to incur greater expenses to market our titles 

retailers have limited shelf space and promotional resources and competition is intense among newly introduced interactive entertainment software titles for adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support competition for retail shelf space is expected to continue to increase which may require us to increase our marketing expenditures to maintain desirable sales levels of our titles competitors with more extensive lines and more popular titles may have greater bargaining power with retailers accordingly we may not be able or we may have to pay more than our competitors to achieve similar levels of promotional support and shelf space 

our business is partly dependent on our ability to enter into successful software development arrangements with thirdparties 

our success depends on our ability to continually identify and develop new titles on a timely basis we rely on thirdparty software developers for the development of some of our titles quality thirdparty developers are continually in high demand software developers who have developed titles for us in the past may not be available to develop software for us in the future due to the limited number of thirdparty software developers and the limited control that we exercise over them these developers may not be able to complete titles for us on a timely basis or within acceptable quality standards if at all we have entered into agreements with thirdparties to acquire the rights to publish and distribute interactive entertainment software as well as to use licensed intellectual properties in our titles these agreements typically require us to make development payments pay royalties and satisfy other conditions our development payments may not be sufficient to permit developers to develop new software successfully which could result in material delays and significantly increase our costs to bring particular products to market software development costs promotion and marketing expenses and royalties payable to software developers and thirdparty licensors have increased significantly in recent years and reduce potential profits derived from sales of our software future sales of our titles may not be sufficient to recover development payments and advances to software developers and licensors and we may not have adequate financial and other resources to satisfy our contractual commitments to such developers if we fail to satisfy our obligations under agreements with third party developers and licensors the agreements may be terminated or modified in ways that are burdensome to us and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results 

we cannot publish our titles without the approval of hardware licensors that are also our competitors 

we are required to obtain licenses from sony microsoft and nintendo which are also our competitors to develop and publish titles for their respective hardware platforms our existing platform licenses require that we obtain approval for the publication of new titles on a titlebytitle basis as a result the number of titles we are able to publish for these hardware platforms our ability to manage the timing of the release of these titles and accordingly our net revenue from titles for these hardware platforms may be limited if a licensor chooses not to renew or extend our license agreement at the end of its current term or if a licensor were to terminate our license for any reason or does not approve one or more of our titles we may be unable to publish that title as well as additional titles for that licensors platform termination of any 

such agreements or disapproval of titles could seriously hurt our business and prospects we may be unable to continue to enter into license agreements for certain current generation platforms on satisfactory terms or at all failure to enter into any such agreement could also seriously hurt our business 

we rely on a limited number of channel partners who influence the fee structures for online distribution of our games on their platforms 

we rely on a limited number of channel partners including sony play station microsoft xbox apple android and steam certain platform licensors have retained the right to change the fee structures for online distribution of both paid content and free content including patches and corrections on their platforms each channel partners ability to set or influence royalty rates may increase costs which could negatively affect our operating margins we may be unable to distribute our content in a costeffective or profitable manner through this distribution channel which could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

outside of fee arrangements our agreements with our channel partners typically give them significant control over other aspects of the distribution of our products and services that we develop for their platform if our channel partners establish terms that restrict our offerings through their channels or significantly impact the financial terms on which these products or services are offered to our customers we may be unable to distribute our product offerings or be forced to do so on a materially worse financial or business terms 

we may not be able to adequately adjust our cost structure in a timely fashion in response to a sudden decrease in demand 

in the event of a significant decline in revenue we may not be able to dispose of facilities reduce personnel or make other changes to our cost structure without disruption to our operations or without significant termination and exit costs management may not be able to implement such actions in a timely manner if at all to offset an immediate shortfall in revenue and profit moreover reducing costs may impair our ability to produce and develop software titles at sufficient levels in the future 

the potential increasing importance of digital sales to our business exposes us to the risks of that business model including greater competition 

the proportion of our revenues derived from digital content delivery as compared to traditional retail sales may continue to increase the increased importance of digital content delivery in our industry increases our potential competition as the minimum capital needed to produce and publish a digitally delivered game is significantly less than that needed to produce and publish one that is purchased through retail distribution and is played on a game console this will also require us to dedicate capital to developing and implementing alternative marketing strategies which we may not do successfully if either occurs we may be unable to effectively market and distribute our products which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results in addition a continuing shift to digital delivery could result in a deprioritization of our products by traditional retailers 

we depend on servers and internet bandwidth to operate our games and digital services with online features if we were to lose server capacity or lack sufficient internet bandwidth for any reason our business could suffer 

we rely on data servers including those owned or controlled by third parties to enable our customers to download our games and other downloadable content and to operate our online games and other products with online functionality events such as limited hardware failure any broadbased catastrophic server malfunction a significant intrusion by hackers that circumvents security measures or a failure of disaster recovery services would likely interrupt the functionality of our games with online services and could result 

in a loss of sales for games and related services an extended interruption of service could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we expect a significant portion of our games to be online enabled in the future and therefore we must project our future server needs and make advance purchases of servers or server capacity to accommodate expected business demands if we underestimate the amount of server capacity our business requires or if our business were to grow more quickly than expected our consumers may experience service problems such as slow or interrupted gaming access insufficient server capacity may result in decreased sales a loss of our consumer base and adverse consequences to our reputation conversely if we overestimate the amount of server capacity required by our business we may incur additional operating costs 

because of the potential importance of our online business to our revenues and results of operations our ability to access adequate internet bandwidth and online computational resources to support our business is critical if the price of either such resource increases we may not be able to increase our prices or subscriber levels to compensate for such costs which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results 

we submit our products for rating by the entertainment software rating board esrb in the united states and other voluntary or government ratings organizations in foreign countries failure to obtain a target rating for certain of our products could negatively affect our ability to distribute and sell those games as could the rerating of a game for any reason 

we voluntarily submit our game products to the esrb a usbased nonprofit and independent ratings organization the esrb system provides consumers with information about game content using a rating symbol that generally suggests the appropriate player age group and specific content descriptors such as graphic violence profanity or sexually explicit material the esrb may impose significant penalties on game publishers for violations of its rules related to rating or marketing games including revocation of a rating or monetary fines up to 1 million other countries require voluntary or government backed ratings as prerequisites for product sales in some instances we may have to modify our products in order to market them under the target rating which could delay or disrupt the release of our products in addition some of our titles may not be sold at all or without extensive edits in certain countries such as germany 

in the united states if the esrb rates a game as ao age 18 and older platform licensors may not certify the game and retailers may refuse to sell it in addition some consumers have reacted to reratings or controversial game content by refusing to purchase such games demanding refunds for games that they had already purchased and refraining from buying other games published by us many of our rockstar titles and certain of our 2k titles have been rated m age 17 and older by the esrb if we are unable to obtain m ratings and instead receive ao ratings on future versions of those or similar titles as a result of changes in the esrbs ratings standards or for other reasons including the adoption of legislation in this area our business and prospects could be negatively affected if any of our games are rerated by the esrb or other foreign based ratings organizations we could be exposed to litigation administrative fines and penalties and other potential liabilities and our operating results and financial condition could be significantly affected 

we have implemented processes to comply with the requirements of the esrb and other ratings organizations and properly display the designated rating symbols and content descriptions nonetheless these processes are subject to human error circumvention overriding and reasonable resource constraints if a video game we published were found to contain undisclosed pertinent content the esrb could rerate a game retailers could refuse to sell it and demand that we accept the return of any unsold copies or returns from customers and consumers could refuse to buy it or demand that we refund their money this could have a material negative affect on our operating results and financial condition in addition we may be exposed to litigation administrative fines and penalties and our reputation could be harmed which could affect sales of other video games we sell if any of these consequences were to occur our business and financial performance could be significantly harmed 

content policies adopted by retailers consumer opposition and litigation could negatively affect sales of our products 

retailers may decline to sell interactive entertainment software containing what they judge to be graphic violence or sexually explicit material or other content that they deem inappropriate for their businesses if retailers decline to sell our products based upon their opinion that they contain objectionable themes graphic violence or sexually explicit material or other generally objectionable content or if any of our previously m rated series products are rated ao we might be required to significantly change or discontinue particular titles or series which in the case of our bestselling grand theft auto titles could seriously affect our business consumer advocacy groups have opposed sales of interactive entertainment software containing objectionable themes violence or sexual material or other objectionable content by pressing for legislation in these areas and by engaging in public demonstrations and media campaigns additionally although lawsuits seeking damages for injuries allegedly suffered by thirdparties as a result of video games have generally been unsuccessful in the courts claims of this kind have been asserted against us from time to time and may be asserted and be successful in the future 

we are subject to risks and uncertainties of international trade including fluctuations in the values of local foreign currencies against the dollar 

sales in international markets primarily in europe have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2014 approximately 535 of our net revenue was earned outside the united states we have also expanded our asian operations in an effort to increase our geographical scope and diversify our revenue base we are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade including increased credit risks tariffs and duties fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates shipping delays and international political regulatory and economic developments all of which can have a significant influence on our operating results many of our international sales are made in local currencies which could fluctuate against the dollar while we may use forward exchange contracts to a limited extent to seek to mitigate foreign currency risk our operating results could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations 

we face risks from our international operations 

we are subject to certain risks because of our international operations particularly as we continue to grow our business and presence in asia latin america and other parts of the world changes to and compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations may increase our cost of doing business and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals could harm our international and domestic sales trade legislation in either the united states or other countries such as a change in the current tariff structures importexport compliance laws or other trade laws or policies could adversely affect our ability to sell or to distribute in international markets we incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our international operations and could become subject to legal penalties in foreign countries if we do not comply with local laws and regulations which may be substantially different from those in the united states in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it may be common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by united states laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and by local laws such as laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations including those based in or from countries where practices which violate such laws may be customary will not take actions in violation of our policies any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could have a material adverse effect on our business 

if we are unable to protect the intellectual property relating to our software the commercial value of our products will be adversely affected and our competitive position could be harmed 

we develop proprietary software and have obtained the rights to publish and distribute software developed by thirdparties we attempt to protect our software and production techniques under copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as through contractual restrictions on disclosure copying and distribution our software is susceptible to piracy and unauthorized copying unauthorized thirdparties may be able to copy or to reverse engineer our software to obtain and use programming or production techniques that we regard as proprietary well organized piracy operations have also proliferated in recent years resulting in the ability to download pirated copies of our software over the internet although we attempt to incorporate protective measures into our software piracy of our products could negatively affect our future profitability 

if we infringe on or are alleged to infringe on the intellectual property rights of thirdparties our business could be adversely affected 

as our industry grows we may be subject to an increasing amount of litigation that is common in the software industry based on allegations of infringement or other alleged violations of patent copyright andor trademarks in addition we believe that interactive entertainment software will increasingly become the subject of claims that such software infringes on the intellectual property rights of others with both the growth of online functionality and advances in technology game content and software graphics as games become more realistic from time to time we receive notices from thirdparties or are named in lawsuits by thirdparties alleging infringement of their proprietary rights although we believe that our software and technologies and the software and technologies of thirdparty developers and publishers with whom we have contractual relations do not and will not infringe or violate proprietary rights of others it is possible that infringement of proprietary rights of others may occur any claims of infringement with or without merit could be time consuming costly and difficult to defend moreover intellectual property litigation or claims could require us to discontinue the distribution of products obtain a license or redesign our products which could result in additional substantial costs and material delays 

our software is susceptible to errors which can harm our financial results and reputation 

the technological advancements of new hardware platforms result in the development of more complex software products as software products become more complex the risk of undetected errors in new products increases we may need to produce and distribute patches in order to repair such errors which could be costly and may distract our developers from working on new products if despite testing errors are found in new products or releases after shipments have been made we could experience a loss of or delay in timely market acceptance product returns loss of revenue increases in costs relating to the repair of such errors and damage to our reputation 

if we acquire or invest in other businesses intellectual properties or other assets we may be unable to integrate them with our business our financial performance may be impaired andor we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for such transactions 

if appropriate opportunities present themselves we may acquire or make investments in businesses intellectual properties and other assets that we believe are strategic we may not be able to identify negotiate or finance any future acquisition or investment successfully even if we do succeed in acquiring or investing in a business intellectual property or other asset such acquisitions and investments involve a number of risks including 

• retaining key employees and maintaining the key business and customer relationships of the businesses we acquire 20 

• cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from an acquired company or business into our organization • the possibility that the combined company would not achieve the expected benefits including any anticipated operating and product synergies of the acquisition as quickly as anticipated or that the costs of or operational difficulties arising from an acquisition would be greater than anticipated • significant acquisitionrelated accounting adjustments particularly relating to an acquired companys deferred revenue that may cause reported revenue and profits of the combined company to be lower than the sum of their standalone revenue and profits • significant accounting charges resulting from the completion and integration of a sizeable acquisition and increased capital expenditures including potential impairment charges incurred to write down the carrying amount of intangible assets generated as a result of an acquisition • the possibility that we will not discover important facts during due diligence that could have a material adverse effect on the value of the businesses we acquire including the possibility that a change of control of a company we acquire triggers a termination of contractual or intellectual property rights important to the operation of its business • the need to integrate an acquired companys accounting management information human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management and timely reporting and the need to implement or remediate controls procedures and policies appropriate for a public company in an acquired company that prior to the acquisition lacked these controls procedures and policies • litigation or other claims in connection with or inheritance of claims or litigation risks as a result of an acquisition including claims from terminated employees customers or other thirdparties and • to the extent that we engage in strategic transactions outside of the united states we face additional risks including risks related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages currency risks and the particular economic political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries future acquisitions and investments could also involve the issuance of our equity and equitylinked securities potentially diluting our existing stockholders the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses writeoffs of goodwill intangibles or acquired inprocess technology or other increased cash and noncash expenses such as stock based compensation any of the foregoing factors could harm our financial condition or prevent us from achieving improvements in our financial condition and operating performance that could have otherwise been achieved by us on a standalone basis our stockholders may not have the opportunity to review vote on or evaluate future acquisitions or investments 

our ability to acquire and maintain licenses to intellectual property especially for sports titles affects our revenue and profitability competition for these licenses may make them more expensive and increase our costs 

certain of our products are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others for example certain of our 2k products include rights licensed from major sports leagues and players associations similarly some of our other titles are based on licenses of popular entertainment products competition for these licenses is intense if we are unable to maintain these licenses or obtain additional licenses on reasonable economic terms or with significant commercial value our revenue and profitability could decline significantly competition for these licenses may also increase the advances guarantees and royalties that we must pay to the licensor which could significantly increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability in addition on certain intellectual property licenses we are subject to guaranteed minimum payments royalties or standards of performance and may not be able to terminate these 

agreements prior to their stated expiration if such licensed products do not generate revenues in excess of such minimum guarantees our profitability will be adversely affected 

we are subject to contractual covenants which place certain limitations on how we manage our business  

our credit agreement as defined herein and the indentures governing our convertible notes as defined herein may limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt paying dividends repurchasing shares and acquiring or disposing of assets or businesses in addition we have granted a security interest in connection with certain compensatory arrangements which limits our ability to incur senior debt in excess of certain amounts accordingly we may be restricted from taking actions that management believes would be desirable and in the best interests of us and our stockholders our credit agreement and the indentures also require us to satisfy specified financial and nonfinancial covenants a breach of any of the covenants contained in our credit agreement could result in an event of default under the agreement and under the indentures governing our convertible notes and would allow our lenders and noteholders to pursue various remedies including accelerating the repayment of any outstanding indebtedness 

our business and products are subject to potential legislation the adoption of such proposed legislation could limit the retail market for our products 

several proposals have been made for federal legislation to regulate our industry such proposals seek to prohibit the sale of products containing certain content included in some of our games if any such proposals are enacted into law it may limit the potential market for some of our games in the united states and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results other countries such as germany have adopted laws regulating content both in packaged games and those transmitted over the internet that are stricter than current united states laws in the united states proposals have also been made by numerous state legislators to regulate and prohibit the sale of interactive entertainment software products containing certain types of violent or sexual content to under 17 or 18 audiences such as the state of californias ultraviolent video games law that sought to ban the sale or rental of violent video games to minors while such legislation to date has been enjoined by industry and retail groups or been found unconstitutional the adoption into law of such legislation in federal andor in state jurisdictions in which we do significant business could severely limit the retail market for some of our games 

we may need additional capital if we incur losses 

if we incur losses in the future we may be required to raise additional capital in order to fund our operations we could seek to raise capital in a number of ways including through the issuance of debt or equity or through other financing arrangements in october 2011 we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement the credit agreement which amended and restated our july 2007 credit agreement as defined herein which requires us to make periodic interest or other debt service payments in addition we issued 175 convertible notes due 2016 in november 2011 and 100 convertible notes due 2018 in june 2013 the 175 convertible notes and together with the 100 convertible notes the convertible notes which require us to make periodic interest payments to the holders of the convertible notes if we borrow additional funds further debt service payments would probably be necessary in addition the terms of additional debt may impose significant restrictions on our ability to operate our business if we seek financing through the sale of equity or equitybased securities such as our convertible notes our current stockholders will suffer dilution in their percentage ownership of common stock we cannot be certain as to our ability to raise additional capital in the future or under what terms capital would be available if we need to raise capital and are not successful in doing so we will have to consider other options that may include but are not limited to a reduction in our expenditures for internal and external new product development reductions in overhead expenses and sales of intellectual 

property and other assets these actions should they become necessary will likely result in a reduction in the size of our operations and could materially affect the prospects of our business 

we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill becomes impaired 

we are required under us generally accepted accounting principles to review our goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating a requirement to reevaluate whether our goodwill continues to be recoverable include a significant decline in stock price and market capitalization slower growth rates in our industry or other materially adverse events we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill is determined this may adversely affect our operating results 

our reported financial results could be adversely affected by the application of existing or future accounting standards to our business as it evolves 

our reported financial results are affected by the accounting policies promulgated by the sec and national accounting standards bodies and the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies for example standards regarding software revenue recognition have and could further significantly affect the way we account for revenue related to our products and services as we enhance expand and diversify our business and product offerings the application of existing or future financial accounting standards particularly those relating to the way we account for revenue could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results although not necessarily on our cash flows

additional issuances of equity securities by us would dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders 

we may issue equity or equitybased securities such as our convertible notes in the future in connection with acquisitions or strategic transactions to adjust our ratio of debt to equity including through repayment of outstanding debt to fund expansion of our operations or for other purposes to the extent we issue additional equity securities the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders would be reduced 

there is no guarantee that we will do additional share repurchases in the future 

the share repurchase program authorized by the board of directors which authorized the repurchase of up to 7500000 shares of our common stock and had 3283000 shares available for repurchase as of march 31 2014 does not obligate the company to make any purchases at any specific time or situation discontinuing repurchases could adversely affect the price of the companys common stock the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time for any reason 

future sales or other issuances of our common stock could adversely affect its market price 

the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect its price the sale or the availability for sale of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause the price of our common stock to decline the issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of our convertible notes could also adversely affect the price of our common stock 

our stock price has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly 

the market price of our common stock historically has been and we expect will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us including those discussed in the risk factors in this section as well as others not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material to changes in securities analysts earnings estimates or ratings to our results or future financial guidance falling below our expectations and analysts and investors expectations to factors affecting the computer software entertainment media or electronics industries or to national or international economic conditions 

stock markets in general have experienced over the years and continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected market prices for companies such as ours and that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the affected companies these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock regardless of our operating performance 

delaware law our charter documents and provisions of our debt agreements may impede or discourage a takeover which could cause the market price of our shares to decline 

we are a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a thirdparty to acquire control of us even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders our board of directors has the power without stockholder approval to adopt a stockholder rights plan andor to designate the terms of one or more series of preferred stock and issue shares of preferred stock in addition we may under certain circumstances involving a change of control be obligated to repurchase all or a portion of our convertible notes and any potential acquirer would be required to assume our obligations related to any outstanding convertible notes we or any possible acquirer may not have available financial resources necessary to repurchase those notes the ability of our board of directors to create and issue a new series of preferred stock and certain provisions of delaware law our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the indenture governing our notes could impede a merger takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock which under certain circumstances could reduce the market price of our common stock and the value of any outstanding notes 

our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future years taxes could be substantially limited if we experience an ownership change as defined in the internal revenue code 

section 382 of the internal revenue code contains rules that limit the ability of a company to use its net operating loss carryforwards in years after an ownership change which is generally defined as any change in ownership of more than 50 of its stock over a threeyear testing period these rules generally operate by focusing on ownership changes among stockholders owning directly or indirectly 5 or more of the stock of a company andor any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of stock by the company if as a result of future transactions involving our common stock including purchases or sales of stock by 5 stockholders we undergo cumulative ownership changes which exceed 50 over the testing period our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards would be subject to additional limitations under section 382 

generally if an ownership change occurs the annual taxable income limitation on the use of net operating loss carryforwards is equal to the product of the applicable longterm tax exempt rate and the value of the companys stock immediately before the ownership change depending on the resulting limitation a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards could expire before we would be able to use them 

our inability to fully utilize our net operating losses to offset taxable income generated in the future could have a material and negative affect on our future financial position and results of operations 

we are implementing a new enterprise resource planning erp system and we may encounter technical or operational difficulties during the transition that could disrupt our operations 

we are implementing a new enterprise resource planning erp system and we may encounter technical and operating difficulties during the transition to that new system we may experience problems in implementing the new system as our employees learn the new system transfer data from our existing system to the new system and operate with the new system the transition may not be completed promptly or at all or could require us to revert to the currently existing system any difficulties that we encounter in implementing the new system may disrupt our ability to deal effectively with our employees vendors customers and other companies with which we have commercial relationships and also may prevent us from effectively closing a quarterly period and reporting our financial results in a timely manner if we are unable to produce accurate and timely financial statements our stock price may be adversely affected and we may be unable to maintain compliance with the listing requirements of the nasdaq global market

software titles published by our rockstar games label are primarily internally developed we expect rockstar games our whollyowned publisher of the grand theft auto  max payne  midnight club  red dead and other popular franchises to continue to be a leader in the action  adventure product category and create groundbreaking entertainment by leveraging our existing titles as well as developing new brands rockstar continues to expand on our established franchises by developing sequels offering downloadable episodes and content and releasing titles for smartphones and tablets rockstar is also well known for developing brands in other genres including the la noire  bully and manhunt franchises we believe that rockstar has established a uniquely original popular cultural phenomenon with its grand theft auto series which is the interactive entertainment industrys most iconic and critically acclaimed brand and has soldin over 185 million units the latest installment grand theft auto v  was released in september 2013 grand theft auto v includes access to grand theft auto online  which launched in october 2013 

our 2k label has published a variety of popular entertainment properties across all key platforms and across a range of genres including shooter action roleplaying strategy sports and familycasual entertainment we expect 2k to continue to develop new and successful franchises in the future 

2ks internally owned and developed franchises include the critically acclaimed multimillion unit selling bioshock  mafia  sid meiers civilization and xcom series 2k also publishes highly successful externally developed franchises such as borderlands  2k successfully launched borderlands 2 in september 2012 and continued to support the title throughout fiscal year 2014 with robust addon content offerings in march 2013 2k released the critically acclaimed bioshock infinite which has since been supported with addon content in august 2013 2k released the bureau xcom declassified

discontinued operations 

in february 2010 we completed the sale to synnex corporation synnex of our jack of all games thirdparty distribution business which primarily distributed thirdparty interactive entertainment software hardware and accessories in north america for approximately 440 million including 373 million in cash subject to purchase price adjustments and up to an additional 67 million subject to the achievement of certain items which were not met in april 2011 we settled on the purchase price adjustments and as a result the purchase price was lowered by 15 million consequently the net purchase price after the settlement was 358 million the financial results of this business which were previously reported as our distribution business have been classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented the assets and liabilities of this business are reflected as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations 

trends and factors affecting our business 

product release schedule our financial results are affected by the timing of our product releases and the commercial success of those titles our grand theft auto products in particular have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue sales of grand theft auto products generated approximately 689 of the companys net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2014 the timing 

of our grand theft auto releases varies significantly which in turn may affect our financial performance on a quarterly and annual basis 

economic environment and retailer performance we continue to monitor economic conditions that may unfavorably affect our businesses such as deteriorating consumer demand pricing pressure on our products credit quality of our receivables and foreign currency exchange rates our business is dependent upon a limited number of customers who account for a significant portion of our revenue our five largest customers accounted for 394 525 and 439 of net revenue during the fiscal years ended march 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively as of march 31 2014 and 2013 five customers comprised approximately 683 and 572 of our gross accounts receivable respectively with our significant customers those that individually comprised more than 10 of our gross accounts receivable balance accounting for approximately 598 and 305 of such balance at march 31 2014 and 2013 respectively the economic environment has affected our customers in the past and may do so in the future bankruptcies or consolidations of our large retail customers could seriously hurt our business due to uncollectible accounts receivables and the concentration of purchasing power among the remaining large retailers certain of our large customers sell used copies of our games which may negatively affect our business by reducing demand for new copies of our games while the downloadable content that we now offer for certain of our titles may serve to reduce used game sales we expect used game sales to continue to adversely affect our business 

hardware platforms we derive most of our revenue from the sale of products made for video game platforms manufactured by thirdparties such as sonys ps3 and ps4 microsofts xbox 360 and xbox one and nintendos wii and wii u which comprised approximately 914 of the companys net revenue by product platform for the fiscal year ended march 31 2014 the success of our business is dependent upon the consumer acceptance of these platforms and the continued growth in the installed base of these platforms when new hardware platforms are introduced demand for software based on older platforms typically declines which may negatively affect our business during the market transition to the new consoles we continually monitor console hardware sales we manage our product delivery on each current and future platform in a manner we believe to be most effective to maximize our revenue opportunities and achieve the desired return on our investments in product development additionally our development costs are generally higher for titles during platform transition periods and we have a limited ability to predict the consumer acceptance of the future platforms which may affect our sales and profitability accordingly our strategy is to focus our development efforts on a select number of the highest quality titles for these platforms while also expanding our offerings for emerging platforms such as mobile and online games 

online content and digital distribution the interactive entertainment software industry is delivering a growing amount of content through digital online delivery methods we provide a variety of online delivered products and offerings a number of our titles that are available through retailers as packaged goods products are also available through direct digital download through the internet from websites we own and others owned by thirdparties we aim to drive recurrent consumer spending by generating incremental revenues from our titles through downloadable offerings including addon content microtransactions and online play in addition we are publishing an expanding variety of titles for tablets and smartphones which are delivered to consumers through digital download through the internet note 14 to our consolidated financial statements segment and geographic information discloses that net revenue from digital online channels comprised approximately 158 of the companys net revenue by distribution channel for the fiscal year ended march 31 2014 we expect online delivery of games and game offerings to become an increasing part of our business over the longterm 

product releases 

we released the following key titles in fiscal year 2014 



product pipeline 

we have announced the following key titles to date this list does not represent all titles currently in development 



fiscal 2014 financial summary 

our fiscal year ended march 31 2014 net revenue was led by titles from a variety of our top franchises mainly grand theft auto  followed by nba borderlands  wwe and bioshock  our net revenue increased to 23506 million an increase of 11361 million or 935 from the fiscal year ended march 31 2013 

for the fiscal year ended march 31 2014 our net income was 3616 million as compared to a net loss of 295 million in the prior year diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended march 31 2014 was 320 as compared to a net loss per share for the fiscal year ended march 31 2013 of 034 the increase in our earnings was primarily driven by an increase of 11361 million in net revenue and a decrease of 19 points in our operating expenses as a percent of net revenue 

at march 31 2014 we had 9354 million of cash and cash equivalents compared to 4025 million at march 31 2013 the increase in cash and cash equivalents from march 31 2013 was primarily a result of cash provided by operating activities due to cash generated from the september 2013 release of grand theft auto v and the collection of accounts receivable balances primarily attributable to the release of bioshock infinite near the end of the previous fiscal year the increase in cash was partially offset by cash used in financing and investing activities as a result of 2768 million for the repurchase of common stock including the repurchase transaction payments of 1660 million for the extinguishment of the 4375 convertible notes 557 million for the termination of our convertible note warrant transactions and the purchase of fixed assets partially offset by proceeds of 2832 million from the issuance of 2875 million aggregate principal amount of 100 convertible notes and 844 million from the termination of our convertible note hedge transactions 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we base our estimates assumptions and judgments on historical experience current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared on a regular basis management reviews the accounting policies assumptions estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are fairly presented in accordance with us gaap however because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 

we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our financial results and they require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the effect and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue on the sales of software products upon the transfer of title and risk of loss to our customers accordingly we recognize revenue for software titles when there is 1 persuasive evidence that an arrangement with the customer exists which is generally based on a customer purchase order 2 the product is delivered 3 the selling price is fixed or determinable and 4 collection of the customer receivable is deemed probable certain products are sold to customers with a street date  ie the earliest date these products may be sold by retailers for these products we recognize revenue on the later of the street date or the sale date in addition some of our software products are sold as full game digital downloads and digital addon content for which the consumer takes possession of the digital content for a fee revenue from product downloads is generally recognized when the download is made available assuming all other recognition criteria are met 

in providing credit terms to our customers our payment arrangements typically provide net 30 and 60 day terms advances received for licensing and exclusivity arrangements are reported on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred revenue until we meet our performance obligations at which point we recognize the revenue 

for some of our software products we enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which we may provide a combination of full game software additional addon content maintenance or support when all other recognition criteria are met for our software and softwarerelated multiple element arrangements we determine the fair value of each delivered and undelivered element using vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe and allocate the total price among the various elements absent vsoe for each element revenue is deferred until the earlier of the point at which vsoe of fair value exists for any undelivered element or until all elements of the arrangement have been delivered for arrangements which require that revenue recognition is deferred the cost of goods sold is deferred and recognized as the related net revenue is recognized deferred cost of goods sold includes product costs software development costs and royalties and licenses however if the only undelivered element is maintenance and support the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material 

increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period we determine vsoe for each element based on historical standalone sales to third parties in determining vsoe we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range 

we establish whether our software products contain morethaninconsequential online functionality by evaluating the significance of the development effort and the nature of the online features the extent of anticipated marketing focus on the online features the significance of the online features to the consumers anticipated overall gameplay experience and the significance of our post sale obligations to consumers determining whether the online functionality for a particular game constitutes morethanan inconsequential deliverable is subjective and requires managements judgment 

when our software products provide online functionality that has a morethaninconsequential separate service deliverable we recognize the softwarerelated revenues and the related cost of sales ratably over the estimated service period of the title assuming all other recognition criteria are met when our software products provide limited online functionality at no additional cost to the consumer we generally consider such features to be incidental to the overall product offering and an inconsequential deliverable accordingly we do not defer revenue related to products containing such online features 

certain of our software products include ingame advertising for third party products advance payments received for ingame advertising are reported on the balance sheet as deferred revenue until we meet our performance obligations at which point we recognize the revenue which is generally at the time of the initial release of the product 

revenue is recognized after deducting estimated reserves for returns price concessions and other allowances in circumstances when we do not have a reliable basis to estimate returns and price concessions or are unable to determine that collection of a receivable is probable we defer the revenue until such time as we can reliably estimate any related returns and allowances and determine that collection of the receivable is probable 

allowances for returns price concessions and other allowances 

we accept returns and grant price concessions in connection with our publishing arrangements following reductions in the price of our products we grant price concessions to permit customers to take credits against amounts they owe us with respect to merchandise unsold by them our customers must satisfy certain conditions to entitle them to return products or receive price concessions including compliance with applicable payment terms and confirmation of field inventory levels 

generally our distribution arrangements with customers do not give them the right to return titles or to cancel firm orders however we occasionally accept returns from our customers for stock balancing and make accommodations to customers which include credits and returns when demand for specific titles falls below expectations 

we make estimates of future product returns and price concessions related to current period product revenue we estimate the amount of future returns and price concessions for published titles based upon among other factors historical experience and performance of the titles in similar genres historical performance of the hardware platform customer inventory levels analysis of sellthrough rates sales force and retail customer feedback industry pricing market conditions and changes in demand and acceptance of our products by consumers 

significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for returns and price concessions in any accounting period we believe we can make reliable estimates of returns and price concessions however actual results may differ from initial estimates as a result of changes in circumstances market conditions and assumptions adjustments to estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 

software development costs and licenses 

capitalized software development costs include direct costs incurred for internally developed titles and payments made to thirdparty software developers under development agreements 

we capitalize internal software development costs including stockbased compensation specifically identifiable employee payroll expense and incentive compensation costs related to the completion and release of titles thirdparty production and other content costs subsequent to establishing technological feasibility of a software title technological feasibility of a product includes the completion of both technical design documentation and game design documentation significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of when technological feasibility is established for products where proven technology exists this may occur early in the development cycle technological feasibility is evaluated on a product by product basis 

we enter into agreements with thirdparty developers that require us to make payments for game development and production services in exchange for these payments we receive the exclusive publishing and distribution rights to the finished game title as well as in some cases the underlying intellectual property rights such agreements typically allow us to fully recover these payments to the developers at an agreed upon royalty rate earned on the subsequent retail sales of such software net of any agreed upon costs prior to establishing technological feasibility of a product we record any costs incurred by third party developers as research and development expenses subsequent to establishing technological feasibility of a product we capitalize all development and production service payments to thirdparty developers as software development costs and licenses we typically enter into agreements with thirdparty developers after completing the technical design documentation for our products and therefore record the design costs leading up to a signed development contract as research and development expense when we contract with thirdparty developers we generally select those that have proven technology and experience in the genre of the software being developed which often allows for the establishment of technological feasibility early in the development cycle in instances where the documentation of the design and technology are not in place prior to an executed contract we monitor the software development process and require our thirdparty developers to adhere to the same technological feasibility standards that apply to our internally developed products 

licenses consist of payments and guarantees made to holders of intellectual property rights for use of their trademarks copyrights or other intellectual property rights in the development of our products agreements with license holders generally provide for guaranteed minimum payments for use of their intellectual property guaranteed minimum payments are initially recorded as an asset licenses and as a liability accrued licenses upon execution of a licensing agreement provided that no significant performance remains to be completed by the licensor when significant performance remains to be completed by the licensor we record payments when actually paid 

certain licenses especially those related to our sports products extend over multiyear periods and encompass multiple game titles in addition to guaranteed minimum payments these licenses frequently contain provisions that could require us to pay royalties to the license holder based on preagreed unit sales thresholds 

amortization of capitalized software development costs and licenses commences when a product is released and is recorded on a titlebytitle basis in cost of goods sold for capitalized software development costs amortization is calculated using 1 the proportion of current year revenues to the total revenues expected to be recorded over the life of the title or 2 the straightline method over the remaining estimated useful life of the title whichever is greater for capitalized licenses amortization is calculated as a ratio of 1 current period revenues to the total revenues expected to be recorded over the remaining life of the title or 2 the contractual royalty rate based on actual net product sales as defined in the licensing agreement whichever is greater 

we evaluate the future recoverability of capitalized software development costs and licenses on a quarterly basis recoverability is primarily assessed based on the actual titles performance for products that are scheduled to be released in the future recoverability is evaluated based on the expected performance of the specific products to which the cost or license relates we utilize a number of criteria in evaluating expected product performance including historical performance of comparable products developed with comparable technology market performance of comparable titles orders for the product prior to its release general market conditions and past performance of the franchise when management determines that the value of the title is unlikely to be recovered by product sales capitalized costs are charged to cost of goods sold in the period in which such determination is made 

we have established profit and unit sales based internal royalty programs that provide for certain of our employees to participate in the success of software titles that they assist in developing royalties earned by employees under this program are recorded as a component of cost of goods sold as the related revenues are recognized 

fair value estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap often requires us to determine the fair value of a particular item to fairly present our consolidated financial statements without an independent market or another representative transaction determining the fair value of a particular item requires us to make several assumptions that are inherently difficult to predict and can have a material influence on the conclusion of the appropriate accounting 

there are various valuation techniques used to estimate fair value these include 1 the market approach where market transactions for identical or comparable assets or liabilities are used to determine the fair value 2 the income approach which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts for example future cash flows or future earnings to a single present amount and 3 the cost approach which is based on the amount that would be required to replace an asset for many of our fair value estimates including our estimates of the fair value of acquired intangible assets we use the income approach using the income approach requires the use of financial models which require us to make various estimates including but not limited to 1 the potential future cash flows for the asset liability or equity instrument being measured 2 the timing of receipt or payment of those future cash flows 3 the time value of money associated with the delayed receipt or payment of such cash flows and 4 the inherent risk associated with the cash flows risk premium making these cash flow estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and if any of the estimates used to determine the fair value using the income approach turns out to be inaccurate our financial results may be negatively affected furthermore relatively small changes in many of these estimates can have a significant influence on the estimated fair value resulting from the financial models or the related accounting conclusion reached for example a relatively small change in the estimated fair value of an asset may change a conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired while we are required to make certain fair value assessments associated with the accounting for several types of transactions the following areas are the most sensitive to the assessments 

inventory obsolescence we regularly review inventory quantities onhand and in the retail channels and record an inventory provision for excess or obsolete inventory based on the future expected demand for our products significant changes in demand for our products would affect managements estimates in establishing our inventory provision we write down inventory based on excess or obsolete inventories determined primarily by future anticipated demand for our products inventory writedowns are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market value based upon assumptions about future demand that are inherently difficult to assess 

business combinations—goodwill and intangible assets we must estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these can have a material effect on our reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various lives furthermore a change in the estimated fair value of an asset or liability often has a direct influence on the amount to recognize as goodwill which is an asset that is not amortized often determining the fair value of these assets and liabilities assumed requires an assessment of expected use of the asset the expected cost to extinguish the liability or our expectations related to the timing and the successful completion of development of an acquired inprocess technology such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material influence on our financial statements 

we use either the income cost or market approach to aid in our conclusions of such fair values and asset lives the income approach presumes that the value of an asset can be estimated by the net economic benefit to be received over the life of the asset discounted to present value the cost approach presumes that an investor would pay no more for an asset than its replacement or reproduction cost the market approach estimates value based on what other participants in the market have paid for reasonably similar assets although each valuation approach is considered in valuing the assets acquired the approach ultimately selected is based on the characteristics of the asset and the availability of information 

we evaluate our goodwill annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount the determination of whether or not goodwill has become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units changes in our strategy andor market conditions could significantly affect these judgments and require reductions to recorded intangible asset balances 

longlived assets we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions including determining which cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset the useful life over which cash flows will occur their amount and the assets residual value if any in turn measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value which is based on the best information available we use internal discounted cash flow estimates quoted market prices when available and independent appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value we derive the required cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans and apply an appropriate discount rate 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment in estimating expected stock volatility and the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 

we have granted stock options to nonemployees which were subject to variable accounting when variable accounting is applied to stock option grants we remeasured the fair value of the unvested options at the end of each reporting period or until the options are cancelled or expire unexercised compensation expense in any given period was calculated as the difference between total earned compensation at the end of the period less total earned compensation at the beginning of the period both of which was based on the price of our common stock at such dates as a result fluctuations in the price of our common stock changed compensation expense recognized by us from period to period 

we have also granted time and marketbased restricted stock awards to employees and nonemployees timebased and marketbased awards to nonemployees are subject to variable accounting for the timebased restricted stock awards to nonemployees we cumulatively remeasure the fair value at the end 

of every period based on the month end closing price of our common stock marketbased restricted stock awards vest based on the relative performance of our common stock to a composite index we calculate the fair value of marketbased restricted stock awards using a monte carlo simulation method which requires a substantial number of inputs and estimates of future market conditions and considers the range of various vesting probabilities as a result expense recorded for our nonemployee awards can fluctuate substantially from period to period 

income taxes 

we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred income taxes are recognized for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at currently enacted statutory tax rates for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized our history of pretax losses in fiscal years prior to the current year represents sufficient evidence for us to determine that the establishment of a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset is appropriate this valuation allowance offsets deferred tax assets associated with future tax deductions as well as carryforward items 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in addition our filed tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 

we recognize and measure uncertain tax positions and record tax benefits when it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

at each period end it is necessary for us to make certain estimates and assumptions to compute the provision for income taxes including allocations of certain transactions to different tax jurisdictions amounts of permanent and temporary differences the likelihood of deferred tax assets being recovered and the outcome of contingent tax risks these estimates and assumptions are revised as new events occur more experience is acquired and additional information is obtained the effect of these revisions is recorded in income tax expense or benefit in the period in which they become known 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

reclassification of accumulated other comprehensive income 

in february 2013 new guidance was issued requiring new disclosures about reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income this new guidance requires an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in addition an entity is required to present either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period for other amounts that are not required under us gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income an 

entity is required to crossreference to other disclosures required under us gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts this new guidance became effective prospectively for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2012 april 1 2013 for the company since there were no reclassifications during the year ending march 31 2014 the adoption of this new guidance did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements 

presentation of unrecognized tax benefits 

in july 2013 new guidance was issued requiring that entities that have an unrecognized tax benefit and a net operating loss carryforward or similar tax loss or tax credit carryforward in the same jurisdiction as the uncertain tax position present the unrecognized tax benefit as a reduction of the deferred tax asset for the loss or tax credit carryforward rather than as a liability when the uncertain tax position would reduce the loss or tax credit carryforward under the tax law the disclosure requirements will be effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after december 15 2013 april 1 2014 for the company and will require prospective application while early adoption is permitted we will adopt the guidance beginning april 1 2014 the adoption is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

fluctuations in operating results and seasonality 

we have experienced fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results as a result of the timing of the introduction of new titles variations in sales of titles developed for particular platforms market acceptance of our titles development and promotional expenses relating to the introduction of new titles sequels or enhancements of existing titles projected and actual changes in platforms the timing and success of title introductions by our competitors product returns changes in pricing policies by us and our competitors the size and timing of acquisitions the timing of orders from major customers order cancellations and delays in product shipment sales of our products are also seasonal with peak shipments typically occurring in the fourth calendar quarter as a result of increased demand for titles during the holiday season quarterly and annual comparisons of operating results are not necessarily indicative of future operating results

financial condition 

we are subject to credit risks particularly if any of our receivables represent a limited number of customers or are concentrated in foreign markets if we are unable to collect our accounts receivable as they become due it could adversely affect our liquidity and working capital position 

generally we have been able to collect our accounts receivable in the ordinary course of business we do not hold any collateral to secure payment from customers we have trade credit insurance on the majority of our customers to mitigate accounts receivable risk 

a majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to major retailers and distributors our five largest customers accounted for 394 525 and 439 of net revenue during the fiscal years ended march 31 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively as of march 31 2014 and 2013 five customers accounted for 683 and 572 of our gross accounts receivable respectively customers that individually accounted for more than 10 of our gross accounts receivable balance comprised 598 and 305 of such balances at march 31 2014 and 2013 respectively based upon performing ongoing credit evaluations maintaining trade credit insurance on a majority of our customers and our past collection experience we believe that the receivable balances from these largest customers do not represent a significant credit risk although we actively monitor each customers credit worthiness and economic conditions that may affect our customers business and access to capital we are monitoring the current global economic conditions including credit markets and other factors as it relates to our customers in order to manage the risk of uncollectible accounts receivable 

we believe our current cash and cash equivalents and projected cash flow from operations along with availability under our credit agreement will provide us with sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash requirements for working capital capital expenditures and commitments through at least the next 12 months 

as of march 31 2014 the amount of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the us by our foreign subsidiaries was approximately 2129 million these balances are dispersed across various locations around the world we believe that such dispersion meets the business and liquidity needs of our foreign affiliates in addition the company expects in the foreseeable future to have the ability to generate sufficient cash domestically to support ongoing operations consequently it is the companys intention to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries in the event the company needed to repatriate funds outside of the us such repatriation may be subject to local laws and tax consequences including foreign withholding taxes or us income taxes it is not practicable to estimate the tax liability and the company would try to minimize the tax effect to the extent possible however any repatriation may not result in significant cash payments as the taxable event would likely be offset by the utilization of the then available tax credits 

in january 2013 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 7500000 shares of our common stock the authorization permits the company to purchase shares from time to time through a variety of methods including in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws it does not obligate the company to make any purchases at any specific time or situation repurchases are subject to the availability of stock prevailing market conditions 

the trading price of the stock the companys financial performance and other conditions the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time for any reason during the fiscal year end march 31 2014 the company repurchased approximately 4217000 shares of our common stock in the open market for approximately 733 million including commissions of approximately 004 million as part of the program as of march 31 2014 up to approximately 3283000 shares of our common stock remain available for repurchase under the companys share repurchase authorization 

in november 2013 the company entered into a purchase agreement with high river limited partnership icahn partners lp icahn partners master fund lp icahn partners master fund ii lp and icahn partners master fund iii lp collectively the icahn group pursuant to which the company repurchased approximately 12021000 shares of the companys common stock owned by the icahn group at a price per share of 1693 resulting in an aggregate purchase price of approximately 2035 million the repurchase transaction the closing of the repurchase transaction occurred on november 26 2013 the repurchase transaction was conducted outside the companys share repurchase program described above 

our changes in cash flows were as follows 



at march 31 2014 we had 9354 million of cash and cash equivalents compared to 4025 million at march 31 2013 the increase in cash and cash equivalents from march 31 2013 was primarily a result of cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to cash generated from the september 2013 release of grand theft auto v and the collection of accounts receivable balances primarily attributable to the release of bioshock infinite near the end of the previous fiscal year the increase in cash was partially offset by cash used in financing and investing activities net cash used by financing and investing activities related to 2768 million for the repurchase of common stock payments of 1660 million for the extinguishment of the 4375 convertible notes 557 million for the termination of our convertible note warrant transactions and the purchase of fixed assets partially offset by proceeds of 2832 million from the issuance of 2875 million aggregate principal amount of 100 convertible notes and 844 million from the termination of our convertible note hedge transactions 

contractual obligations and commitments 

we have entered into various agreements in the ordinary course of business that require substantial cash commitments over the next several years generally these include 

• agreements to acquire licenses to intellectual property such as trademarks copyrights and technology for use in the publishing marketing and distribution of our software titles in addition we have certain minimum marketing support commitments where we commit to spend specified amounts related to marketing our products our licensing and marketing commitments primarily reflect agreements with major sports leagues and players associations and expire at various times through september 2018 52 

• contractual payments to thirdparty software developers that expire at various times through september 2017 guaranteed minimum payments assume satisfactory performance • operating leases primarily related to occupancy furniture and equipment expiring at various times through fiscal year 2025 included in the cash commitments for operating leases below is a liability for a lease assumption without economic benefit which was approximately 06 million at march 31 2014 and is recorded in liabilities of discontinued operations on the consolidated balance sheet see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations and • purchase obligations primarily related to agreements to purchase services that are enforceable and legally binding on the company that specifies all significant terms including fixed minimum or variable pricing provisions and the approximate timing of the transactions expiring at various times through august 2016 a summary of annual minimum contractual obligations and commitments as of march 31 2014 is as follows in thousands of dollars 



in addition to the cash commitments above we have also entered into acquisition agreements that contain provisions for us to pay contingent cash consideration typically contingent on the acquired company achieving certain financial unit sales or performance conditions the amount and timing of these payments are currently not fixed or determinable see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our potential acquisition commitments 

income taxes at march 31 2014 the company had recorded a liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits of 249 million for which we are unable to make a reasonable and reliable estimate of the period in which these liabilities will be settled with the respective tax authorities therefore these liabilities have not been included in the contractual obligations table 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of march 31 2014 and 2013 we did not have any material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial parties such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such we are not exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 

international operations 

net revenue earned outside of the united states is principally generated by our operations in europe asia australia canada and latin america for the fiscal years ended march 31 2014 2013 and 2012 approximately 535 415 and 456 respectively of our net revenue was earned outside the united states we are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade including increased credit risks tariffs and duties fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates shipping delays and international political regulatory and economic developments all of which can have a significant effect on our operating results 

fluctuations in quarterly operating results and seasonality 

we have experienced fluctuations in quarterly operating results as a result of the timing of the introduction of new titles variations in sales of titles developed for particular platforms market acceptance of our titles development and promotional expenses relating to the introduction of new titles sequels or enhancements of existing titles projected and actual changes in platforms the timing and success of title introductions by our competitors product returns changes in pricing policies by us and our competitors the accuracy of retailers forecasts of consumer demand the size and timing of acquisitions the timing of orders from major customers and order cancellations and delays in product shipment sales of our titles are also seasonal with peak shipments typically occurring in the fourth calendar quarter as a result of increased demand for titles during the holiday season quarterly comparisons of operating results are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential loss arising from fluctuations in market rates and prices our market risk exposures primarily include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

historically fluctuations in interest rates have not had a significant effect on our operating results under our credit agreement outstanding balances bear interest at our election of a 150 to 200 above a certain base rate 475 at march 31 2014 or b 250 to 300 above the libor rate approximately 265 at march 31 2014 with the margin rate subject to the achievement of certain average liquidity levels changes in market rates may affect our future interest expense if there is an outstanding balance on our line of credit the 175 convertible notes and the 100 convertible notes pay interest semiannually at a fixed rate of 175 and 100 respectively per annum and we expect that there will be no fluctuation related to the convertible notes affecting our cash component of interest expense for additional details on our convertible notes see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we transact business in foreign currencies and are exposed to risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates accounts relating to foreign operations are translated into united states dollars using prevailing exchange rates at the relevant period end translation adjustments are included as a separate component of stockholders equity for the fiscal year ended march 31 2014 and 2013 our foreign currency translation adjustment was approximately 64 million gain and 116 million loss respectively we recognized a foreign currency exchange transaction gain of 02 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2014 and a foreign currency exchange transaction loss for the fiscal years ended march 31 2013 and 2012 of 08 million and 13 million respectively in interest and other net in our consolidated statements of operations 

cash flow hedging activities 

we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with forecasted transactions involving nonfunctional currency denominated expenditures these contracts which are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts is reported as either assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets the effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these hedges is initially reported net of tax as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity the gross amount of the effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these hedges is subsequently reclassified into cost of goods sold or research and development expenses as appropriate in the period when the forecasted transaction is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations in the event that the gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income loss are deemed to be ineffective the ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value if any is reclassified to interest and other net in our consolidated statements of operations in the event that the underlying forecasted transactions do not occur or it becomes probable that they will not occur within the defined hedge period the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income loss to interest and other net in our consolidated statements of operations during the reporting periods all forecasted transactions occurred and therefore there were no such gains or losses reclassified into interest and other net we do not enter into derivative financial contracts for speculative or trading purposes at march 31 2014 and 2013 we had 09 million and 79 million respectively of forward contracts outstanding to buy foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars all of which have maturities of less than one year as of march 31 2014 and 2013 the fair value of these outstanding forward contracts was immaterial and is included in prepaid expenses and other 

the fair value of these outstanding forward contracts is estimated based on the prevailing exchange rates of the various hedged currencies as of the end of the period 

balance sheet hedging activities 

we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with nonfunctional currency denominated cash balances and intercompany funding loans nonfunctional currency denominated accounts receivable and nonfunctional currency denominated accounts payable these transactions are not designated as hedging instruments and are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts is reported as either assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value are reported in interest and other net in our consolidated statements of operations we do not enter into derivative financial contracts for speculative or trading purposes at march 31 2014 we had 685 million of forward contracts outstanding to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars all of which have maturities of less than one year at march 31 2013 we had 554 million of forward contracts outstanding to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars all of which have maturities of less than one year for the fiscal years ended march 31 2014 2013 and 2012 we recorded a loss of 184 million gain of 22 million and gain of 07 respectively related to foreign currency forward contracts in interest and other net on the consolidated statements of operations as of march 31 2014 and 2013 the fair value of these outstanding forward contracts was immaterial and is included in prepaid expenses and other at march 31 2014 and accrued expenses and other current liabilities at march 31 2013 the fair value of these outstanding forward contracts is estimated based on the prevailing exchange rates of the various hedged currencies as of the end of the period 

our hedging programs are designed to reduce but do not entirely eliminate the effect of currency exchange rate movements we believe the counterparties to these foreign currency forward contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks and that the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risks there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations for the fiscal year ended march 31 2014 535 of the companys revenue was generated outside the united states using sensitivity analysis a hypothetical 10 increase in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would decrease revenues by 54 while a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would increase revenues by 54 in the opinion of management a substantial portion of this fluctuation would be offset by cost of goods sold and operating expenses incurred in local currency

focus on core strength of producing select high quality titles we focus on publishing a select number of highquality titles based on internallyowned and developed intellectual property which typically provide higher margins than licensed products we currently own the intellectual property rights of 20 proprietary brands in addition we will selectively develop titles based on licensed properties including sports and also publish externally developed titles 

we use a product investment review process to evaluate potential titles for investment to review existing titles in development and to assess titles after release to measure their performance in the market and the return on our investment we apply this process to all of our products whether internally or externally developed the product investment review process includes reviews of each project at various stages of development by our executive management team and senior management of our publishing labels and includes coordination between our sales and marketing personnel before the launch of the titles this disciplined approach to product investment is expected to enhance the competitiveness and profitability of our titles 

we develop our products using a combination of our internal and external development resources acting under contract with us we typically select our external developers based on their track record and expertise in developing products in the same category or genre one developer will generally produce the same game for multiple platforms and will also produce sequels to an original game we believe that selecting and using development resources in this manner allows us to leverage the particular expertise of our internal and external development resources which we believe increases the quality of our products 

leverage emerging technologies platforms and distribution channels including digitally delivered content interactive entertainment played on mobile platforms including tablets and smartphones and online platforms including social networks represent exciting opportunities to enhance our growth and profitability in addition the interactive entertainment software industry is delivering a growing amount of content for traditional platforms through digital download on the internet we provide a variety of online delivered products and offerings a number of our titles that are available through retailers as packaged goods products are also available through direct digital download on the internet from websites we own and others owned by thirdparties we also offer downloadable addon content for our packaged goods titles in addition we are publishing an expanding variety of titles for tablets and smartphones which are delivered to consumers through digital download through the internet we will continue to invest in emerging opportunities in mobile and online gameplay particularly for our whollyowned franchises as well as downloadable content and microtransactions where gamers can pay to download additional content to enhance their game playing experience 

expand international business the global market for interactive entertainment continues to grow and we seek to increase our presence internationally particularly in asia eastern europe and latin america we have expansion initiatives in the asian markets where our strategy is to broaden the distribution of our 

existing products expand our business in japan and establish an online gaming presence especially in china and korea we are a direct publisher in japan and korea historically we distributed our products in asia through license agreements with local publishers in japan and korea and distribution agreements with local distributors of finished goods elsewhere in asia while we retain title to all intellectual property under license agreements local publishers are responsible for localization of software content distribution and marketing of the products in their respective local markets we intend to continue to build upon our licensing relationships and also expand finished goods distribution strategies to grow our international business 

our businesses 

our revenue is primarily derived from the sale of internally developed software titles and software titles developed by thirdparties for our benefit operating margins are dependent in part upon our ability to continually release new commercially successful products and to manage software product development costs we have internal development studios located in australia canada china czech republic the united kingdom and the united states as of march 31 2013 we had a research and development staff of 1808 employees with the technical capabilities to develop software titles for all major current and prior generation consoles handheld hardware platforms and pcs in multiple languages and territories 

operating margins associated with our externally developed titles or titles for which we do not own the intellectual property are generally lower because they require us to acquire licenses provide minimum development guarantees and pay thirdparty royalties agreements with thirdparty developers generally give us exclusive publishing and marketing rights and require us to make development payments pay royalties based on product sales and satisfy other conditions development payments for software titles are typically recoupable against royalties otherwise due to developers based on software sales our agreements with thirdparty developers generally provide us with the right to monitor development efforts and to cease making development payments if specified development milestones are not satisfied we also regularly monitor the level of development payments in light of expected sales for the related titles 

we continue to explore evolving business models such as downloadable content online gaming and microtransactions we expect downloadable content to become more prevalent as broadband connectivity continues to gain popularity and digital delivery platforms gain additional customers we also have expansion initiatives in the asia markets where our strategy is to broaden the distribution of our existing products expand our business in japan and establish an online gaming presence especially in china and korea

we also enter into content license agreements such as those with sports leagues players associations music labels and musicians these licenses are typically limited to use of the licensed rights in products for specific time periods in addition we license and include console manufacturer technology in our products on a nonexclusive basis which allows our games to be played on their respective hardware systems 

manufacturing 

sony microsoft and nintendo either manufacture or control selection of approved manufacturers of software products sold for use on their respective hardware platforms we place a purchase order for the manufacture of our products with sony microsoft or nintendo and then send software code and a prototype of the product to the manufacturer together with related artwork user instructions warranty information brochures and packaging designs for approval defect testing and manufacture games are generally shipped within two to three weeks of receipt of our purchase order and all materials

we also digitally distribute our titles downloadable content and microtransactions direct to consoles and pcs including smartphones and tablets we view digital distribution as an important growth opportunity for our industry and company however we continue to expect that packaged goods and traditional retailers will be the primary channel for the sale of our products for the foreseeable future 

marketing 

our marketing and promotional efforts are intended to maximize consumer interest in our titles promote brand name recognition of our franchises assist retailers and properly position package and merchandise 

our titles from time to time we also receive marketing support from hardware manufacturers in connection with their own promotional efforts 

we market titles by 

• implementing public relations campaigns using print and online advertising television radio spots and outdoor advertising we believe that we label and market our products in accordance with the applicable principles and guidelines of the entertainment software rating board or the esrb an independent selfregulatory body that assigns ratings and enforces advertising guidelines for the interactive software industry • satisfying certain shelf life and sales requirements under our agreements with hardware manufacturers in order to qualify for sonys greatest hits programs and microsofts platinum hits program in connection with these programs we receive manufacturing discounts from sony and microsoft • stimulating continued sales by reducing the wholesale prices of our products to retailers at various times during the life of a product price concessions may occur at any time in a products life cycle but typically occur three to nine months after a products initial launch during the fiscal years ended march 31 2013 2012 and 2011 price concessions amounted to 662 million 860 million and 599 million respectively in certain international markets we also provide volume rebates to stimulate continued product sales • employing various other marketing methods designed to promote consumer awareness including social media instore promotions and pointofpurchase displays direct mail cooperative advertising attendance at trade shows as well as product sampling through demonstration software distributed through the internet or the digital online services in addition to our media retail and public relations campaigns an important part of our marketing strategy leverages evolving business models such as downloadable addon content for our front line titles addon content generates incremental revenues and also helps to prolong consumer engagement with our titles which extends the life of each new release and enhances the value of our franchises as of march 31 2013 we had a sales and marketing staff of 303 people 

product procurement 

we procure products from suppliers principally using standard purchase orders based on our assessment of market demand as well as preorders from retailers we carry inventory quantities that we believe are necessary to provide rapid response to retailer orders we utilize electronic data interchange with many of our customers to enhance the efficiency of placing and shipping orders and receiving payments 

competition 

in our business we compete with 

• companies that range in size and cost structure from very small with limited resources to very large companies with greater financial marketing and technical personnel and other resources than ours including activision blizzard electronic arts and international companies such as capcom konami namcobandai sega square enix and ubisoft • sony microsoft and nintendo for licenses to properties and the sale of interactive entertainment software each of which is a large developer and marketer of software for its own platforms each of these competitors has the financial resources to withstand significant price competition and to implement extensive advertising campaigns 7 

• other software hardware entertainment and media for limited retail shelf space and promotional resources the competition is intense among an increasing number of newly introduced entertainment software titles and hardware for adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support • other forms of entertainment such as motion pictures television and audio social networking online computer programs mobile games and other forms of entertainment which may be less expensive or provide other advantages to consumers competition in the entertainment software industry is based on innovation features playability and product quality brand name recognition compatibility with popular platforms access to distribution channels price marketing and customer service our business is driven by hit titles which require increasing budgets for development and marketing competition for our titles is influenced by the timing of competitive product releases and the similarity of such products to our titles and may result in loss of shelf space or a reduction in sellthrough of our titles at retail stores 

trends and factors affecting our business 

product release schedule our financial results are affected by the timing of our product releases and the commercial success of those titles our grand theft auto products in particular have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue sales of grand theft auto products generated approximately 113 of the companys net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2013 the timing of our grand theft auto releases varies significantly which in turn may affect our financial performance on a quarterly and annual basis 

economic environment and retailer performance we continue to monitor economic conditions that may unfavorably affect our businesses such as deteriorating consumer demand pricing pressure on our products credit quality of our receivables and foreign currency exchange rates our business is dependent upon a limited number of customers who account for a significant portion of our revenue our five largest customers accounted for 525 439 and 438 of net revenue during the fiscal years ended march 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively as of march 31 2013 and 2012 our five largest customers comprised approximately 572 and 613 of our gross accounts receivable respectively with our significant customers those that individually comprised more than 10 of our gross accounts receivable balance accounting for approximately 305 and 406 of such balance at march 31 2013 and 2012 respectively the economic environment has affected our customers in the past and may do so in the future bankruptcies or consolidations of our large retail customers could seriously hurt our business due to uncollectible accounts receivables and the concentration of purchasing power among the remaining large retailers certain of our large customers sell used copies of our games which may negatively affect our business by reducing demand for new copies of our games while the downloadable content that we now offer for certain of our titles may serve to reduce used game sales we expect used game sales to continue to adversely affect our business 

hardware platforms we derive most of our revenue from the sale of products made for video game platforms manufactured by thirdparties such as sonys ps3 microsofts xbox 360 and nintendos wii which comprised approximately 795 of the companys net revenue by product platform for the fiscal year ended march 31 2013 the success of our business is dependent upon the consumer acceptance of these platforms and the continued growth in the installed base of these platforms when new hardware platforms are introduced demand for software based on older platforms declines which may negatively affect our business additionally our development costs are generally higher for titles based on new platforms and we have limited ability to predict the consumer acceptance of the new platforms which may affect our sales and profitability as a result our strategy is to focus our development efforts on a select number of the highest quality titles for these platforms while also expanding our offerings for emerging platforms such as mobile and online games 

online content and digital distribution the interactive entertainment software industry is delivering a growing amount of content through digital online delivery methods we provide a variety of online delivered products and offerings a number of our titles that are available through retailers as packaged goods products are also available through direct digital download through the internet from websites we own and others owned by thirdparties we also offer downloadable addon content to our packaged goods titles in addition we are publishing an expanding variety of titles for tablets and smartphones which are delivered to consumers through digital download through the internet note 15 to our consolidated financial statements segment and geographic information discloses that net revenue from digital online channels comprised approximately 211 of the companys net revenue by distribution channel for the fiscal year ended march 31 2013 we expect online delivery of games and game offerings to become an increasing part of our business over the longterm 

international operations 

international sales are a significant part of our business for the fiscal years ended march 31 2013 2012 and 2011 approximately 415 456 and 455 respectively of our net revenue was earned outside the united states we have also expanded our asian operations in an effort to increase our geographical scope and diversify our revenue base we are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade including increased credit risks tariffs and duties fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates shipping delays and international political regulatory and economic developments all of which can have a significant effect on our operating results see notes 1 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

segment and geographic information 

see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

employees 

as of march 31 2013 we had 2440 fulltime employees of which 1238 were employed outside of the united states none of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements we consider our relations with employees to be satisfactory 




 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties which may affect our future financial performance because of the risks and uncertainties described below as well as other factors affecting our operating results and financial condition past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and our business and financial performance could be harmed and the market value of our securities could decline 

risks relating to our business 

we are dependent on the future success of our grand theft auto products and we must continue to publish hit titles or sequels to such hit titles in order to compete successfully in our industry 

grand theft auto and certain of our other titles are hit products and have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue sales of grand theft auto products generated approximately 113 of the companys net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2013 and the ten bestselling titles including grand theft auto  that significantly contributed to the companys net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2013 in the aggregate accounted for approximately 911 of the companys net revenue if we fail to continue to develop and sell new commercially successful hit titles or sequels to such hit titles or experience any delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of our hit titles or their sequels our revenue and profits may decrease substantially and we may incur losses in addition competition in our industry is intense and a relatively small number of hit titles account for a large portion of total revenue in our industry hit products offered by our competitors may take a larger share of consumer spending than we anticipate which could cause revenue generated from our products to fall below our expectations if our competitors develop more successful products or services at lower price points or based on payment models perceived as offering better value or if we do not continue to develop consistently high quality and wellreceived products and services our revenue and profitability may decline in addition both the online and mobile games marketplaces are characterized by frequent product introductions relatively low barriers to entry and new and evolving business methods technologies and platforms for development widespread consumer adoption of these new platforms for games and other technological advances in online or mobile game offerings could negatively affect our sales of console and traditional pc products before we have an opportunity to develop profitable businesses in such markets 

we are subject to product development risks which could result in delays and additional costs and we must adapt to changes in software technologies 

we depend on our internal development studios and thirdparty software developers to develop new interactive entertainment software within anticipated release schedules and cost projections the development cycle for new titles generally ranges from 12 to more than 24 months and our topselling titles could take up to 3 years or longer to develop development times and costs of current generation software have increased substantially as a result of the additional and enhanced features available in the newest games further after development of a product it may take between 9 and 12 additional months to develop the product for other hardware platforms if our thirdparty software developers experience unanticipated development delays financial difficulties or additional costs we will not be able to release titles according to our schedule and at budgeted costs certain of our licensing and marketing agreements also contain provisions that would impose penalties if we fail to meet agreed upon game release dates there can be no assurance that our products will be sufficiently successful so that we can recoup these costs or make a profit on these products 

additionally in order to stay competitive our internal development studios must anticipate and adapt to rapid technological changes affecting software development any inability to respond to technological advances and implement new technologies could render our products obsolete or less marketable 

the inability of our products to achieve significant market acceptance delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of our products may have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

new products may not achieve significant market acceptance generate sufficient sales or be introduced in a timely manner to permit us to recover development manufacturing and marketing costs associated with these products the life cycle of a title generally involves a relatively high level of sales during the first few months after introduction followed by a rapid decline in sales because revenue associated with an initial product launch generally constitutes a high percentage of the total revenue associated with the life of a product delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of one or more new products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cause our operating results to be materially different from our expectations 

our business is subject to our ability to develop commercially successful products for the current generation video game platforms and our ability to transition our business model and strategy to the next generation platforms 

we derive most of our revenue from the sale of products made for video game platforms manufactured by thirdparties such as sonys ps3 microsofts xbox 360 and nintendos wii which comprised approximately 795 of the companys net revenue by product platform for the fiscal year ended march 31 2013 the success of our business is subject to the continued popularity of these platforms and our ability to develop commercially successful products for these platforms 

video game hardware platforms have historically had a life cycle of four to six years and we anticipate a transition to new console platforms in the near future during any such transitional period our success will depend on our ability to develop our products and services for these nextgeneration consoles this transition may require significant costs and management resources there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully transition our business model and strategy to these new platforms further the hardware manufacturers are not required to enter into agreements with us with respect to new consoles and these manufacturers may choose to impose more restrictive terms or adopt very different business models and fee structures as a result the transition to new platforms could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial statements 

connectivity issues related to digital delivery platforms could affect our ability to sell and provide online services for our products and could affect our profitability 

we rely upon thirdparty digital delivery platforms such as steam microsofts xbox live and sony entertainment network to provide connectivity from the consumer to our digital products and our online services connectivity issues could prevent customers from accessing this content and our ability to successfully market and sell our products could be adversely affected in addition we could experience similar issues related to services we host on our internal servers such issues also could affect our ability to provide online services and could affect our business 

our business could be adversely affected if our consumer data protection measures are not seen as adequate or there are breaches of our security measures or unintended disclosures of our consumer data 

we are collecting and storing consumer information including personal information and credit card information we take measures to protect our consumer data from unauthorized access or disclosure it is possible that our security controls over consumer data may not prevent the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information in addition due to the high profile nature of our products we may draw a disproportionately higher amount of attention and attempts to breach our security controls than companies with lower profile products a security breach that leads to disclosure of consumer account information including personally identifiable information could harm our reputation compel us to comply with disparate breach notification laws in various jurisdictions and otherwise subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue a resulting 

perception that our products or services do not adequately protect the privacy of personal information could result in a loss of current or potential consumers and business partners in addition if any of our business partners experience a security breach that leads to disclosure of consumer account information our reputation could be harmed resulting in loss of revenue 

the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the us europe and elsewhere are often uncertain contradictory and in flux it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices if so this could result in government imposed fines or orders requiring that we change our data practices which could have an adverse effect on our business complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 

in addition certain of our products are onlineenabled the ability of our products to offer online functionality and our ability to offer content through a video game platforms digital distribution channel is dependent upon the continued operation and security of such platforms online network these thirdparty networks as well as our own internal systems and websites and the security measures related thereto may be breached as a result of thirdparty action including intentional misconduct by computer hackers employee error malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers data or our data including our intellectual property and other confidential business information or our information technology systems because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs we may lose business suffer irreparable damage to our reputation andor incur significant costs and expenses relating to the investigation and possible litigation of claims relating to such event 

security breaches involving the source code for our products could adversely affect our revenues 

we securely store the source code for our interactive entertainment software products as it is created a breach whether physical electronic or otherwise of the systems on which such source code and other sensitive data are stored could lead to damage or piracy of our software if we are subject to data security breaches we may have a loss in sales or increased costs arising from the restoration or implementation of additional security measures which could materially and adversely affect our profitability any theft andor unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an event could adversely affect our competitive position reputation brand and future sales of our products our business could be subject to significant disruption and we could suffer monetary and other losses and reputational harm in the event of such incidents and claims 

if we are unable to sustain launch pricing on current generation titles our operating results may suffer 

the interactive entertainment software and hardware industry is characterized by the introduction of new and enhanced generations of products and evolving industry standards current generation titles for the ps3 xbox 360 and wii have been offered at premium retail prices since the launch of such consoles we expect to continue to price current generation titles at a premium level however circumstances may arise in which we may need to reduce prices for such titles if we are unable to sustain launch pricing on these current generation titles it will have a material adverse effect on our margins profitability and operating results 

our efforts to expand into new products and services may subject us to additional risks 

in recent years we have invested in emerging opportunities in interactive entertainment played on mobile platforms including tablets and smartphones and online platforms including social networks we have also grown our product offerings that are available through digital download we are actively investing to 

capitalize on these trends in order to diversify our product mix reduce our operating risks and increase our revenue there are risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed there is no assurance that we will be able to attract a sufficiently large number of customers or recover costs incurred for developing and marketing these new products or services external factors such as competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences may also impact the successful implementation of any new products or services failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial statements 

we depend on our key management and product development personnel 

our continued success will depend to a significant extent on our senior management team and our relationship with zelnickmedia corporation zelnickmedia our executive chairman and chief executive officer and president are partners of zelnickmedia we are also highly dependent on the expertise skills and knowledge of certain of our rockstar employees and other key creative personnel responsible for content creation and development of our grand theft auto titles and titles based on other brands we may not be able to continue to retain these personnel at current compensation levels or at all 

the loss of the services of our executive officers zelnickmedia our key rockstar employees or other key creative personnel could significantly harm our business in addition if one or more key employees were to join a competitor or form a competing company we may lose additional personnel experience material interruptions in product development delays in bringing products to market and difficulties in our relationships with licensors suppliers and customers which would significantly harm our business failure to continue to attract and retain other qualified management and creative personnel could adversely affect our business and prospects 

declines in consumer spending and other adverse changes in the economy could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 

most of our products involve discretionary spending on the part of consumers we believe that consumer spending is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income this makes our products particularly sensitive to general economic conditions and economic cycles as consumers are generally more willing to make discretionary purchases including purchases of products like ours during periods in which favorable economic conditions prevail adverse economic conditions such as a prolonged us or international general economic downturn including periods of increased inflation unemployment levels tax rates interest rates energy prices or declining consumer confidence could also reduce consumer spending reduced consumer spending has and may continue to result in reduced demand for our products and may also require increased selling and promotional expenses which has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results in addition during periods of relative economic weakness our consolidated credit risk reflecting our counterparty dealings with distributors customers capital providers and others may increase perhaps materially so furthermore uncertainty and adverse changes in the economy could also increase the risk of material losses on our investments increase costs associated with developing and publishing our products increase the cost and availability of sources of financing and increase our exposure to material losses from bad debts any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results if economic conditions worsen our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 

changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and in various other jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and in the ordinary course of business 

there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain we are required to estimate future taxes although we currently believe our tax estimates are reasonable the estimate process is inherently uncertain and such estimates are not binding on tax authorities further our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by a variety of factors including changes in the business including the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in tax elections and changes in applicable tax laws additionally tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities and developments in those audits could adversely affect our income tax provision should the ultimate tax liability exceed estimates our income tax provision and net income or loss could be adversely affected 

beginning in fiscal year 2006 we recorded a valuation allowance against most of our us deferred tax assets we expect to provide a valuation allowance on future us tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability or until other significant positive evidence arises that suggest that these benefits are more likely than not to be realized further our tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities and developments in those audits could adversely affect our income tax provision should our ultimate tax liability exceed our estimates our income tax provision and net income or loss could be materially affected 

we earn a significant amount of our operating income and hold a significant portion of our cash outside the us any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions may result in higher effective tax rates for the company in addition there have been proposals to change us tax laws that would significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings although we cannot predict whether or in what form this proposed legislation will pass if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our income tax provision and financial condition 

we are also required to pay taxes other than income taxes such as payroll sales use valueadded net worth property and goods and services taxes in both the us and foreign jurisdictions we are regularly under examination by tax authorities with respect to these nonincome taxes there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations changes in our business or changes in applicable tax rules will not have an adverse effect on our net income or loss and financial condition 

our quarterly operating results are dependent on the release of hit titles and are highly seasonal which may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate significantly 

we have experienced and may continue to experience wide fluctuations in quarterly operating results the release of a hit title typically leads to a high level of sales during the first few months after introduction followed by a rapid decline in sales in addition the interactive entertainment industry is highly seasonal with sales typically higher during the fourth calendar quarter due primarily to increased demand for games during the holiday season demand for and sales of our sports titles are also seasonal in that they are typically released just prior to the start of the sport season which they depict if a key event or sports season to which our product release schedule is tied were to be delayed or cancelled our sales would also suffer disproportionately our failure or inability to produce hit titles or introduce products on a timely basis to meet seasonal fluctuations in demand could adversely affect our business and operating results the uncertainties associated with software development manufacturing lead times production delays and the approval process for products by hardware manufacturers and other licensors make it difficult to predict the quarter in which our products will ship and therefore may cause us to fail to meet financial expectations 

returns of our published titles by our customers and price concessions granted to our customers may adversely affect our operating results 

we are exposed to the risk of product returns and price concessions with respect to our customers our distribution arrangements with customers generally do not give them the right to return titles to us or to 

cancel firm orders however we sometimes accept product returns from our distribution customers for stock balancing and negotiate accommodations for customers which include credits and returns when demand for specific products falls below expectations we accept returns and grant price concessions in connection with our publishing arrangements and revenue is recognized after deducting estimated reserves for returns and price concessions while we believe that we can reliably estimate future returns and price concessions if return rates and price concessions for our products exceed our reserves our revenue could decline 

increased sales of used video game products could lower our sales 

certain of our larger customers sell used video games which are generally priced lower than new video games if our customers continue to increase their sales of used video games it could negatively affect our sales of new video games and have an adverse influence on our operating results 

a limited number of customers account for a significant portion of our sales the loss of a principal customer could seriously hurt our business 

a substantial portion of our product sales are made to a limited number of customers sales to our five largest customers during the fiscal year ended march 31 2013 accounted for approximately 525 of our net revenue with gamestop accounting for 238 our sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders without longterm agreements or other commitments and our customers may terminate their relationship with us at any time certain of our customers may decline to carry products containing mature content the loss of our relationships with principal customers or a decline in sales to principal customers including as a result of a product being rated ao age 18 and over could materially adversely affect our business and operating results furthermore our customers may also be placed into bankruptcy become insolvent or be liquidated due to economic downturns global contractions of credit or for other factors bankruptcies or consolidations of certain large retail customers could seriously hurt our business including as a result of uncollectible accounts receivable from such customers and the concentration of purchasing power among remaining large retailers in addition our results of operations may be adversely affected if certain of our customers who purchase on credit terms are no longer eligible to purchase on such terms due to their financial distress which may reduce the quantity of products they demand from us 

if our marketing and advertising efforts fail to resonate with our customers our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

our products are marketed worldwide through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs such as television and online advertising print advertising retail merchandising website development and event sponsorship our ability to sell our products and services is dependent in part on the success of these programs if the marketing for our products and services fails to resonate with our customers particularly during the holiday season or other key selling periods or if advertising rates or other media placement costs increase these factors could have a material adverse influence on our business and operating results 

the interactive entertainment software industry is highly competitive 

we compete for both licenses to properties and the sale of interactive entertainment software with sony microsoft and nintendo each of which is a large developer and marketer of software for its own platforms we also compete with domestic game publishers such as activision blizzard and electronic arts and international publishers such as capcom konami namcobandai sega square enix and ubisoft as our business is dependent upon our ability to develop hit titles which require increasing budgets for development and marketing the availability of significant financial resources has become a major competitive factor in developing and marketing software games some of our competitors have greater financial technical personnel and other resources than we do and are able to finance larger budgets for 

development and marketing and make higher offers to licensors and developers for commercially desirable properties our titles also compete with other forms of entertainment such as social media and casual games in addition to motion pictures television and audio and video products featuring similar themes online computer programs and other entertainment which may be less expensive or provide other advantages to consumers 

a number of software publishers who compete with us have developed and commercialized or are currently developing online games for use by consumers over the internet if technological advances significantly increase the availability of online games and if consumer acceptance of online gaming grows substantially it could result in a decline in our platformbased software sales and negatively affect sales of such products 

increased competition for limited shelf space and promotional support from retailers could affect the success of our business and require us to incur greater expenses to market our titles 

retailers have limited shelf space and promotional resources and competition is intense among newly introduced interactive entertainment software titles for adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support competition for retail shelf space is expected to continue to increase which may require us to increase our marketing expenditures to maintain desirable sales levels of our titles competitors with more extensive lines and more popular titles may have greater bargaining power with retailers accordingly we may not be able or we may have to pay more than our competitors to achieve similar levels of promotional support and shelf space 

our business is dependent on our ability to enter into successful software development arrangements with thirdparties 

our success depends on our ability to continually identify and develop new titles on a timely basis we rely on thirdparty software developers for the development of some of our titles quality thirdparty developers are continually in high demand software developers who have developed titles for us in the past may not be available to develop software for us in the future due to the limited number of thirdparty software developers and the limited control that we exercise over them these developers may not be able to complete titles for us on a timely basis or within acceptable quality standards if at all we have entered into agreements with thirdparties to acquire the rights to publish and distribute interactive entertainment software as well as to use licensed intellectual properties in our titles these agreements typically require us to make development payments pay royalties and satisfy other conditions our development payments may not be sufficient to permit developers to develop new software successfully which could result in material delays and significantly increase our costs to bring particular products to market software development costs promotion and marketing expenses and royalties payable to software developers and thirdparty licensors have increased significantly in recent years and reduce potential profits derived from sales of our software future sales of our titles may not be sufficient to recover development payments and advances to software developers and licensors and we may not have adequate financial and other resources to satisfy our contractual commitments to such developers if we fail to satisfy our obligations under agreements with thirdparty developers and licensors the agreements may be terminated or modified in ways that are burdensome to us and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

we cannot publish our titles without the approval of hardware licensors that are also our competitors 

we are required to obtain licenses from sony microsoft and nintendo which are also our competitors to develop and publish titles for their respective hardware platforms our existing platform licenses require that we obtain approval for the publication of new titles on a titlebytitle basis as a result the number of titles we are able to publish for these hardware platforms our ability to manage the timing of the release of these titles and accordingly our net revenue from titles for these hardware platforms may be limited if a 

licensor chooses not to renew or extend our license agreement at the end of its current term or if a licensor were to terminate our license for any reason or does not approve one or more of our titles we may be unable to publish that title as well as additional titles for that licensors platform termination of any such agreements or disapproval of titles could seriously hurt our business and prospects we may be unable to continue to enter into license agreements for certain current generation platforms on satisfactory terms or at all failure to enter into any such agreement could also seriously hurt our business 

our platform licensors control the fee structures for online distribution of our games on their platforms 

certain platform licensors have retained the right to change the fee structures for online distribution of both paid content and free content including patches and corrections on their platforms each licensors ability to set royalty rates may increase costs which could negatively affect our operating margins we may be unable to distribute our content in a costeffective or profitable manner through this distribution channel which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we may not be able to adequately adjust our cost structure in a timely fashion in response to a sudden decrease in demand 

in the event of a significant decline in revenue we may not be able to dispose of facilities reduce personnel or make other changes to our cost structure without disruption to our operations or without significant termination and exit costs management may not be able to implement such actions in a timely manner if at all to offset an immediate shortfall in revenue and profit moreover reducing costs may impair our ability to produce and develop software titles at sufficient levels in the future 

we submit our products for rating by the entertainment software rating board esrb in the united states and other voluntary or government ratings organizations in foreign countries failure to obtain a target rating for certain of our products could negatively affect our ability to distribute and sell those games as could the rerating of a game for any reason 

we voluntarily submit our game products to the esrb a usbased nonprofit and independent ratings organization the esrb system provides consumers with information about game content using a rating symbol that generally suggests the appropriate player age group and specific content descriptors such as graphic violence profanity or sexually explicit material the esrb may impose significant penalties on game publishers for violations of its rules related to rating or marketing games including revocation of a rating or monetary fines up to 1 million other countries require voluntary or government backed ratings as prerequisites for product sales in some instances we may have to modify our products in order to market them under the target rating which could delay or disrupt the release of our products in addition some of our titles may not be sold at all or without extensive edits in certain countries such as germany 

in the united states if the esrb rates a game as ao age 18 and older platform licensors may not certify the game and retailers may refuse to sell it in addition some consumers have reacted to reratings or controversial game content by refusing to purchase such games demanding refunds for games that they had already purchased and refraining from buying other games published by us many of our rockstar titles and certain of our 2k titles have been rated m age 17 and older by the esrb if we are unable to obtain m ratings and instead receive ao ratings on future versions of those or similar titles as a result of changes in the esrbs ratings standards or for other reasons including the adoption of legislation in this area our business and prospects could be negatively affected if any of our games are rerated by the esrb or other foreign based ratings organizations we could be exposed to litigation administrative fines and penalties and other potential liabilities and our operating results and financial condition could be significantly affected 

we have implemented processes to comply with the requirements of the esrb and other ratings organizations and properly display the designated rating symbols and content descriptions nonetheless these processes are subject to human error circumvention overriding and reasonable resource constraints if a video game we published were found to contain undisclosed pertinent content the esrb could rerate a game retailers could refuse to sell it and demand that we accept the return of any unsold copies or returns from customers and consumers could refuse to buy it or demand that we refund their money this could have a material negative affect on our operating results and financial condition in addition we may be exposed to litigation administrative fines and penalties and our reputation could be harmed which could affect sales of other video games we sell if any of these consequences were to occur our business and financial performance could be significantly harmed 

content policies adopted by retailers consumer opposition and litigation could negatively affect sales of our products 

retailers may decline to sell interactive entertainment software containing what they judge to be graphic violence or sexually explicit material or other content that they deem inappropriate for their businesses if retailers decline to sell our products based upon their opinion that they contain objectionable themes graphic violence or sexually explicit material or other generally objectionable content or if any of our previously m rated series products are rated ao we might be required to significantly change or discontinue particular titles or series which in the case of our bestselling grand theft auto titles could seriously affect our business consumer advocacy groups have opposed sales of interactive entertainment software containing objectionable themes violence or sexual material or other objectionable content by pressing for legislation in these areas and by engaging in public demonstrations and media campaigns additionally although lawsuits seeking damages for injuries allegedly suffered by thirdparties as a result of video games have generally been unsuccessful in the courts claims of this kind have been asserted against us from time to time and may be asserted and be successful in the future 

we are subject to risks and uncertainties of international trade including fluctuations in the values of local foreign currencies against the dollar 

sales in international markets primarily in europe have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue note 15 to our consolidated financial statements segment and geographic information discloses that sales in europe comprised approximately 270 of the companys net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2013 we have also expanded our asian operations in an effort to increase our geographical scope and diversify our revenue base we are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade including increased credit risks tariffs and duties fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates shipping delays and international political regulatory and economic developments all of which can have a significant influence on our operating results many of our international sales are made in local currencies which could fluctuate against the dollar while we may use forward exchange contracts to a limited extent to seek to mitigate foreign currency risk our operating results could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations 

we face risks from our international operations 

we are subject to certain risks because of our international operations particularly as we continue to grow our business and presence in asia latin america and other parts of the world changes to and compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations may increase our cost of doing business and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals could harm our international and domestic sales trade legislation in either the united states or other countries such as a change in the current tariff structures importexport compliance laws or other trade laws or policies could adversely affect our ability to sell or to distribute in international markets we incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our international operations and could become subject to legal penalties in foreign countries if we do not comply with local 

laws and regulations which may be substantially different from those in the united states in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it may be common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by united states laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and by local laws such as laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations including those based in or from countries where practices which violate such laws may be customary will not take actions in violation of our policies any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could have a material adverse effect on our business 

if we are unable to protect the intellectual property relating to our software the commercial value of our products will be adversely affected and our competitive position could be harmed 

we develop proprietary software and have obtained the rights to publish and distribute software developed by thirdparties we attempt to protect our software and production techniques under copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as through contractual restrictions on disclosure copying and distribution our software is susceptible to piracy and unauthorized copying unauthorized thirdparties may be able to copy or to reverse engineer our software to obtain and use programming or production techniques that we regard as proprietary well organized piracy operations have also proliferated in recent years resulting in the ability to download pirated copies of our software over the internet although we attempt to incorporate protective measures into our software piracy of our products could negatively affect our future profitability 

if we infringe on or are alleged to infringe on the intellectual property rights of thirdparties our business could be adversely affected 

as our industry grows we may be subject to an increasing amount of litigation that is common in the software industry based on allegations of infringement or other alleged violations of patent copyright andor trademarks in addition we believe that interactive entertainment software will increasingly become the subject of claims that such software infringes on the intellectual property rights of others with both the growth of online functionality and advances in technology game content and software graphics as games become more realistic from time to time we receive notices from thirdparties or are named in lawsuits by thirdparties alleging infringement of their proprietary rights although we believe that our software and technologies and the software and technologies of thirdparty developers and publishers with whom we have contractual relations do not and will not infringe or violate proprietary rights of others it is possible that infringement of proprietary rights of others may occur any claims of infringement with or without merit could be time consuming costly and difficult to defend moreover intellectual property litigation or claims could require us to discontinue the distribution of products obtain a license or redesign our products which could result in additional substantial costs and material delays 

our software is susceptible to errors which can harm our financial results and reputation 

the technological advancements of new hardware platforms result in the development of more complex software products as software products become more complex the risk of undetected errors in new products increases we may need to produce and distribute patches in order to repair such errors which could be costly and may distract our developers from working on new products if despite testing errors are found in new products or releases after shipments have been made we could experience a loss of or delay in timely market acceptance product returns loss of revenue increases in costs relating to the repair of such errors and damage to our reputation 

if we acquire or invest in other businesses intellectual properties or other assets we may be unable to integrate them with our business our financial performance may be impaired andor we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for such transactions 

if appropriate opportunities present themselves we may acquire or make investments in businesses intellectual properties and other assets that we believe are strategic we may not be able to identify negotiate or finance any future acquisition or investment successfully even if we do succeed in acquiring or investing in a business intellectual property or other asset such acquisitions and investments involve a number of risks including 

• retaining key employees and maintaining the key business and customer relationships of the businesses we acquire • cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from an acquired company or business into our organization • the possibility that the combined company would not achieve the expected benefits including any anticipated operating and product synergies of the acquisition as quickly as anticipated or that the costs of or operational difficulties arising from an acquisition would be greater than anticipated • significant acquisitionrelated accounting adjustments particularly relating to an acquired companys deferred revenue that may cause reported revenue and profits of the combined company to be lower than the sum of their standalone revenue and profits • significant accounting charges resulting from the completion and integration of a sizeable acquisition and increased capital expenditures including potential impairment charges incurred to write down the carrying amount of intangible assets generated as a result of an acquisition • the possibility that we will not discover important facts during due diligence that could have a material adverse effect on the value of the businesses we acquire including the possibility that a change of control of a company we acquire triggers a termination of contractual or intellectual property rights important to the operation of its business • the need to integrate an acquired companys accounting management information human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management and timely reporting and the need to implement or remediate controls procedures and policies appropriate for a public company in an acquired company that prior to the acquisition lacked these controls procedures and policies • litigation or other claims in connection with or inheritance of claims or litigation risks as a result of an acquisition including claims from terminated employees customers or other thirdparties and • to the extent that we engage in strategic transactions outside of the united states we face additional risks including risks related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages currency risks and the particular economic political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries future acquisitions and investments could also involve the issuance of our equity and equitylinked securities potentially diluting our existing stockholders the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses writeoffs of goodwill intangibles or acquired inprocess technology or other increased cash and noncash expenses such as stock based compensation any of the foregoing factors could harm our financial condition or prevent us from achieving improvements in our financial condition and operating performance that could have otherwise been achieved by us on a standalone basis our stockholders may not have the opportunity to review vote on or evaluate future acquisitions or investments 

our ability to acquire and maintain licenses to intellectual property especially for sports titles affects our revenue and profitability competition for these licenses may make them more expensive and increase our costs 

certain of our products are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others for example certain of our 2k products include rights licensed from major sports leagues and players associations similarly some of our other titles are based on licenses of popular entertainment products competition for these licenses is intense if we are unable to maintain these licenses or obtain additional licenses on reasonable economic terms or with significant commercial value our revenue and profitability could decline significantly competition for these licenses may also increase the advances guarantees and royalties that we must pay to the licensor which could significantly increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability in addition on certain intellectual property licenses we are subject to guaranteed minimum payments royalties or standards of performance and may not be able to terminate these agreements prior to their stated expiration if such licensed products do not generate revenues in excess of such minimum guarantees our profitability will be adversely affected 

we are subject to contractual covenants which place certain limitations on how we manage our business  

our credit agreement as defined herein and the indentures governing our convertible notes as defined herein limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt paying dividends repurchasing shares and acquiring or disposing of assets or businesses in addition we have granted a security interest in connection with certain compensatory arrangements which limits our ability to incur senior debt in excess of certain amounts accordingly we may be restricted from taking actions that management believes would be desirable and in the best interests of us and our stockholders our credit agreement and the indentures also require us to satisfy specified financial and nonfinancial covenants a breach of any of the covenants contained in our credit agreement could result in an event of default under the agreement and under the indentures governing our convertible notes and would allow our lenders and noteholders to pursue various remedies including accelerating the repayment of any outstanding indebtedness 

our involvement and the involvement of some of our former executive officers in a wide variety of lawsuits investigations and proceedings has had and may in the future have a material adverse effect on us 

we and some of our former officers directors and employees have been the subject of three separate governmental investigations and a substantial amount of litigation and other proceedings relating to the subject matter of those investigations while these matters have been resolved we may be subject to heightened scrutiny in the future as a result of our historical legal proceedings including an increased likelihood of a government investigation occurring and an increased likelihood that any such investigation is more extensive than in the past furthermore any future fines restrictions or other penalties imposed as a result of any such investigation may be more severe than those which may be imposed on a company without our history 

our business and products are subject to potential legislation the adoption of such proposed legislation could limit the retail market for our products 

several proposals have been made for federal legislation to regulate our industry such proposals seek to prohibit the sale of products containing content included in some of our games if any such proposals are enacted into law it may limit the potential market for some of our games in the united states and adversely affect our operating results other countries such as germany have adopted laws regulating content both in packaged games and those transmitted over the internet that are stricter than current united states laws in the united states proposals have also been made by numerous state legislators to regulate and prohibit the sale of interactive entertainment software products containing certain types of violent or sexual content to under 17 or 18 audiences such as the state of californias ultraviolent video games law that sought to ban the sale or rental of violent video games to minors while such legislation to 

date has been enjoined by industry and retail groups or been found unconstitutional the adoption into law of such legislation in federal andor in state jurisdictions in which we do significant business could severely limit the retail market for some of our games 

we may need additional capital if we incur losses 

if we incur losses in the future we may be required to raise additional capital in order to fund our operations we could seek to raise capital in a number of ways including through the issuance of debt or equity or through other financing arrangements in october 2011 we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement the credit agreement which amended and restated our july 2007 credit agreement as defined herein which requires us to make periodic interest or other debt service payments in addition we issued 4375 convertible notes due 2014 in june 2009 the 4375 convertible notes and 175 convertible notes due 2016 in november 2011 the 175 convertible notes and together with the 4375 convertible notes the convertible notes which require us to make periodic interest payments to the holders of the convertible notes if we borrow additional funds further debt service payments would probably be necessary in addition the terms of additional debt may impose significant restrictions on our ability to operate our business if we seek financing through the sale of equity or equitybased securities such as our convertible notes our current stockholders will suffer dilution in their percentage ownership of common stock we cannot be certain as to our ability to raise additional capital in the future or under what terms capital would be available if we need to raise capital and are not successful in doing so we will have to consider other options that may include but are not limited to a reduction in our expenditures for internal and external new product development reductions in overhead expenses and sales of intellectual property and other assets these actions should they become necessary will likely result in a reduction in the size of our operations and could materially affect the prospects of our business 

we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill becomes impaired 

we are required under us generally accepted accounting principles to review our goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating a requirement to reevaluate whether our goodwill continues to be recoverable include a significant decline in stock price and market capitalization slower growth rates in our industry or other materially adverse events we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill is determined this may adversely affect our operating results 

our reported financial results could be adversely affected by the application of existing or future accounting standards to our business as it evolves 

our reported financial results are affected by the accounting policies promulgated by the sec and national accounting standards bodies and the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies for example standards regarding software revenue recognition have and could further significantly affect the way we account for revenue related to our products and services we expect that a significant portion of our games will be onlineenabled in the future and we could be required to recognize the related revenue over an extended period of time rather than at the time of sale as we enhance expand and diversify our business and product offerings the application of existing or future financial accounting standards particularly those relating to the way we account for revenue could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results although not necessarily on our cash flows 

risks relating to our common stock 

for purposes of this section —risks relating to our common stock references to the company we our and us refer only to taketwo interactive software inc and not to its subsidiaries 

additional issuances of equity securities by us would dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders 

we may issue equity or equitybased securities such as our convertible notes in the future in connection with acquisitions or strategic transactions to adjust our ratio of debt to equity including through repayment of outstanding debt to fund expansion of our operations or for other purposes to the extent we issue additional equity securities the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders would be reduced 

future sales or other issuances of our common stock could adversely affect its market price 

the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect its price the sale or the availability for sale of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause the price of our common stock to decline the issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of our convertible notes could also adversely affect the price of our common stock 

our stock price has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly 

the market price of our common stock historically has been and we expect will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us including those discussed in the risk factors in this section as well as others not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material to changes in securities analysts earnings estimates or ratings to our results or future financial guidance falling below our expectations and analysts and investors expectations to factors affecting the computer software entertainment media or electronics industries or to national or international economic conditions 

stock markets in general have experienced over the years and continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected market prices for companies such as ours and that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the affected companies these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock regardless of our operating performance 

the convertible senior note hedge and warrant transactions entered into in connection with the offering of our 4375 convertible notes may affect the value of those notes and our common stock 

in connection with the offering of our 4375 convertible notes we entered into convertible senior note hedge transactions which are expected to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the notes however we also entered into warrant transactions which could separately have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants in addition the counterparties to the hedge and warrant transactions andor their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock andor purchasing or selling our common stock in secondary market transactions at any time prior to the maturity of the 4375 convertible notes and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of the 4375 convertible notes this activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the 4375 convertible notes 

delaware law our charter documents and provisions of our debt agreements may impede or discourage a takeover which could cause the market price of our shares to decline 

we are a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a thirdparty to acquire control of us even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders our board has the power without stockholder approval to adopt a stockholder rights plan andor to designate the terms of one or more series of preferred stock and issue shares of preferred stock in addition we may under certain circumstances involving a change of control be obligated to repurchase all or a portion of our convertible notes and any potential acquirer would be required to assume our obligations related to any outstanding convertible notes we or any possible acquirer may not have available financial resources necessary to repurchase those notes the ability of our board to create and issue a new series of preferred stock and certain provisions of delaware law our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the indenture governing our notes could impede a merger takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock which under certain circumstances could reduce the market price of our common stock and the value of any outstanding notes 

our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future years taxes could be substantially limited if we experience an ownership change as defined in the internal revenue code 

section 382 of the internal revenue code contains rules that limit the ability of a company to use its net operating loss carryforwards in years after an ownership change which is generally defined as any change in ownership of more than 50 of its stock over a threeyear testing period these rules generally operate by focusing on ownership changes among stockholders owning directly or indirectly 5 or more of the stock of a company andor any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of stock by the company if as a result of future transactions involving our common stock including purchases or sales of stock by 5 stockholders we undergo cumulative ownership changes which exceed 50 over the testing period our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards would be subject to additional limitations under section 382 

generally if an ownership change occurs the annual taxable income limitation on the use of net operating loss carryforwards is equal to the product of the applicable longterm tax exempt rate and the value of the companys stock immediately before the ownership change depending on the resulting limitation a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards could expire before we would be able to use them 

our inability to fully utilize our net operating losses to offset taxable income generated in the future could have a material and negative affect on our future financial position and results of operations

discontinued operations 

in february 2010 we completed the sale to synnex corporation synnex of our jack of all games thirdparty distribution business which primarily distributed thirdparty interactive entertainment software hardware and accessories in north america for approximately 440 million including 373 million in cash subject to purchase price adjustments and up to an additional 67 million subject to the achievement of certain items which were not met in april 2011 we settled on the purchase price adjustments and as a result the purchase price was lowered by 15 million consequently the net purchase price after the settlement was 358 million the financial results of this business which were previously reported as our distribution business have been classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented the assets and liabilities of this business are reflected as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations 

trends and factors affecting our business 

product release schedule our financial results are affected by the timing of our product releases and the commercial success of those titles our grand theft auto products in particular have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue sales of grand theft auto products generated approximately 

113 of the companys net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2013 the timing of our grand theft auto releases varies significantly which in turn may affect our financial performance on a quarterly and annual basis 

economic environment and retailer performance we continue to monitor economic conditions that may unfavorably affect our businesses such as deteriorating consumer demand pricing pressure on our products credit quality of our receivables and foreign currency exchange rates our business is dependent upon a limited number of customers who account for a significant portion of our revenue our five largest customers accounted for 525 439 and 438 of net revenue during the fiscal years ended march 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively as of march 31 2013 and 2012 our five largest customers comprised approximately 572 and 613 of our gross accounts receivable respectively with our significant customers those that individually comprised more than 10 of our gross accounts receivable balance accounting for approximately 305 and 406 of such balance at march 31 2013 and 2012 respectively the economic environment has affected our customers in the past and may do so in the future bankruptcies or consolidations of our large retail customers could seriously hurt our business due to uncollectible accounts receivables and the concentration of purchasing power among the remaining large retailers certain of our large customers sell used copies of our games which may negatively affect our business by reducing demand for new copies of our games while the downloadable content that we now offer for certain of our titles may serve to reduce used game sales we expect used game sales to continue to adversely affect our business 

hardware platforms we derive most of our revenue from the sale of products made for video game platforms manufactured by thirdparties such as sonys ps3 microsofts xbox 360 and nintendos wii which comprised approximately 795 of the companys net revenue by product platform for the fiscal year ended march 31 2013 the success of our business is dependent upon the consumer acceptance of these platforms and the continued growth in the installed base of these platforms when new hardware platforms are introduced demand for software based on older platforms declines which may negatively affect our business in february 2013 sony announced that it intends to launch playstation 4 its nextgeneration computer entertainment system by the 2013 yearend holiday buying season we continually monitor console hardware sales as well as the development of nextgeneration consoles we manage our product delivery on each current and future platform in a manner we believe to be most effective to maximize our revenue opportunities and achieve the desired return on our investments in product development additionally our development costs are generally higher for titles based on new platforms and we have limited ability to predict the consumer acceptance of the new platforms which may affect our sales and profitability as a result our strategy is to focus our development efforts on a select number of the highest quality titles for these platforms while also expanding our offerings for emerging platforms such as mobile and online games 

online content and digital distribution the interactive entertainment software industry is delivering a growing amount of content through digital online delivery methods we provide a variety of online delivered products and offerings a number of our titles that are available through retailers as packaged goods products are also available through direct digital download through the internet from websites we own and others owned by thirdparties we also offer downloadable addon content to our packaged goods titles in addition we are publishing an expanding variety of titles for tablets and smartphones which are delivered to consumers through digital download through the internet note 15 to our consolidated financial statements segment and geographic information discloses that net revenue from digital online channels comprised approximately 211 of the companys net revenue by distribution channel for the fiscal year ended march 31 2013 we expect online delivery of games and game offerings to become an increasing part of our business over the longterm 

product releases 

we released the following key titles in fiscal year 2013 



product pipeline 

we have announced the following key titles to date this list does not represent all titles currently in development 



fiscal 2013 financial summary 

our fiscal year ended march 31 2013 net revenue was led by titles from a variety of our top franchises including borderlands 2  nba 2k13  grand theft auto products bioshock infinite and max payne 3  our net revenue increased to 12145 million an increase of 3887 million or 471 from the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 

for the fiscal year ended march 31 2013 our net loss was 295 million as compared to a net loss of 1088 million in the prior year net loss per share for the fiscal year ended march 31 2013 was 034 as compared to a net loss per share for the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 of 131 our decreased net loss for the fiscal year ended march 31 2013 as compared to our net loss for the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 was primarily as a result of 1 an increase of 3887 million in net revenue 2 an increase of 5 points in our gross profit as a percent of net revenue and 3 a decrease of 6 points in our operating expenses as a percent of net revenue partially offset by an increase of 118 million in interest and other net expense for the fiscal year ended march 31 2013 

at march 31 2013 we had 4025 million of cash and cash equivalents compared to 4203 million at march 31 2012 the decrease in cash and cash equivalents from march 31 2012 was primarily a result of our higher accounts receivable balance at march 31 2013 primarily reflecting the release of bioshock infinite near the end of the fiscal year and the purchases of fixed assets partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accruals primarily related to bioshock infinite and royalties payable 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and 

expenses during the reporting periods we base our estimates assumptions and judgments on historical experience current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared on a regular basis management reviews the accounting policies assumptions estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are fairly presented in accordance with us gaap however because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 

we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our financial results and they require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the affect and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue upon the transfer of title and risk of loss to our customers accordingly we recognize revenue for software titles when there is 1 persuasive evidence that an arrangement with the customer exists which is generally based on a customer purchase order 2 the product is delivered 3 the selling price is fixed or determinable and 4 collection of the customer receivable is deemed probable certain products are sold to customers with a street date  ie the earliest date these products may be sold by retailers for these products we recognize revenue on the later of the street date or the sale date in addition some of our software products are sold exclusively as downloads of digital content for which the consumer takes possession of the digital content for a fee revenue from product downloads is generally recognized when the download is made available assuming all other recognition criteria are met 

our payment arrangements with customers typically provide net 30 and 60 day terms advances received for licensing and exclusivity arrangements are reported on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred revenue until we meet our performance obligations at which point we recognize the revenue 

we enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which we may provide a combination of game software additional content maintenance or support assuming all other recognition criteria are met for our software and softwarerelated multiple element arrangements we determine the fair value of each delivered and undelivered element using vendorspecific objective evidence vsoe and allocate the total price among the various elements absent vsoe revenue is deferred until the earlier of the point at which vsoe of fair value exists for any undelivered element or until all elements of the arrangement have been delivered however if the only undelivered element is maintenance and support the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period we determine vsoe for each element based on historical standalone sales to third parties in determining vsoe we require that a substantial majority of the selling prices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range 

in addition some of our software products provide limited online functionality at no additional cost to the consumer generally we consider such features to be incidental to the overall product offering and an inconsequential deliverable accordingly we do not defer revenue related to products containing such online features we determine whether our products contain substantial online functionality by evaluating the significance of the development effort and the nature of the online features the extent of anticipated marketing focus on the online features the significance of the online features to the customers anticipated 

overall gameplay experience and the significance of our post sale obligations to customers overall online play functionality is still an emerging area for us and we continue to monitor this developing functionality and its significance to our products determining whether the online functionality for a particular game constitutes morethanan inconsequential deliverable is subjective and require managements judgment 

certain of our software products include ingame advertising for third party products advance payments received for ingame advertising are reported on the balance sheet as deferred revenue until we meet our performance obligations at which point we recognize the revenue which is generally at the time of the initial release of the product 

revenue is recognized after deducting estimated reserves for returns price concessions and other allowances in circumstances when we do not have a reliable basis to estimate returns and price concessions or are unable to determine that collection of a receivable is probable we defer the revenue until such time as we can reliably estimate any related returns and allowances and determine that collection of the receivable is probable 

allowances for returns price concessions and other allowances 

we accept returns and grant price concessions in connection with our publishing arrangements following reductions in the price of our products we grant price concessions to permit customers to take credits against amounts they owe us with respect to merchandise unsold by them our customers must satisfy certain conditions to entitle them to return products or receive price concessions including compliance with applicable payment terms and confirmation of field inventory levels 

our distribution arrangements with customers generally do not give them the right to return titles or to cancel firm orders however we occasionally accept returns from our customers for stock balancing and make accommodations to customers which include credits and returns when demand for specific titles falls below expectations 

we make estimates of future product returns and price concessions related to current period product revenue we estimate the amount of future returns and price concessions for published titles based upon among other factors historical experience and performance of the titles in similar genres historical performance of the hardware platform customer inventory levels analysis of sellthrough rates sales force and retail customer feedback industry pricing market conditions and changes in demand and acceptance of our products by consumers 

significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for returns and price concessions in any accounting period we believe we can make reliable estimates of returns and price concessions however actual results may differ from initial estimates as a result of changes in circumstances market conditions and assumptions adjustments to estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 

software development costs and licenses 

capitalized software development costs include direct costs incurred for internally developed titles and payments made to thirdparty software developers under development agreements 

we capitalize internal software development costs including stockbased compensation specifically identifiable employee payroll expense and incentive compensation costs related to the completion and release of titles thirdparty production and other content costs subsequent to establishing technological feasibility of a software title technological feasibility of a product includes the completion of both technical design documentation and game design documentation significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of when technological feasibility is established for products where proven technology exists this may occur early in the development cycle technological feasibility is evaluated on a product by product basis 

we enter into agreements with thirdparty developers that require us to make payments for game development and production services in exchange for these payments we receive the exclusive publishing and distribution rights to the finished game title as well as in some cases the underlying intellectual property rights such agreements typically allow us to fully recover these payments to the developers at an agreed upon royalty rate earned on the subsequent retail sales of such software net of any agreed upon costs prior to establishing technological feasibility of a product we record any costs incurred by third party developers as research and development expenses subsequent to establishing technological feasibility of a product we capitalize all development and production service payments to thirdparty developers as software development costs and licenses we typically enter into agreements with thirdparty developers after completing the technical design documentation for our products and therefore record the design costs leading up to a signed development contract as research and development expense when we contract with thirdparty developers we generally select thirdparty developers that have proven technology and experience in the genre of the software being developed which often allows for the establishment of technological feasibility early in the development cycle in instances where the documentation of the design and technology are not in place prior to an executed contract we monitor the software development process and require our thirdparty developers to adhere to the same technological feasibility standards that apply to our internally developed products 

licenses consist of payments and guarantees made to holders of intellectual property rights for use of their trademarks copyrights or other intellectual property rights in the development of our products agreements with license holders generally provide for guaranteed minimum payments for use of their intellectual property guaranteed minimum payments are initially recorded as an asset licenses and as a liability accrued licenses upon execution of a licensing agreement provided that no significant performance remains to be completed by the licensor when significant performance remains to be completed by the licensor we record payments when actually paid 

certain licenses especially those related to our sports products extend over multiyear periods and encompass multiple game titles in addition to guaranteed minimum payments these licenses frequently contain provisions that could require us to pay royalties to the license holder based on preagreed unit sales thresholds 

amortization of capitalized software development costs and licenses commences when a product is released and is recorded on a titlebytitle basis in cost of goods sold for capitalized software development costs amortization is calculated using 1 the proportion of current year revenues to the total revenues expected to be recorded over the life of the title or 2 the straightline method over the remaining estimated useful life of the title whichever is greater for capitalized licenses amortization is calculated as a ratio of 1 current period revenues to the total revenues expected to be recorded over the remaining life of the title or 2 the contractual royalty rate based on actual net product sales as defined in the licensing agreement whichever is greater 

significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of the recoverability of capitalized software costs at each balance sheet date or earlier if an indicator of impairment exists we evaluate the recoverability of capitalized software costs licenses and any other unrecognized minimum commitments that have not been paid using an undiscounted future cash flow analysis we use various measures to evaluate expected product performance and estimate future revenues for our software titles including historical performance of comparable titles orders for titles prior to release and the estimated performance of a sequel title based on the performance of the title on which the sequel is based when management determines that the value of a title is unlikely to be recovered by product sales capitalized costs are charged to cost of goods sold in the period in which such determination is made 

we have established profit and unit sales based internal royalty programs that provide for certain of our employees to participate in the success of software titles that they assist in developing royalties earned by employees under this program are recorded as cost of goods sold as they are incurred 

fair value estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap often requires us to determine the fair value of a particular item to fairly present our consolidated financial statements without an independent market or another representative transaction determining the fair value of a particular item requires us to make several assumptions that are inherently difficult to predict and can have a material influence on the conclusion of the appropriate accounting 

there are various valuation techniques used to estimate fair value these include 1 the market approach where market transactions for identical or comparable assets or liabilities are used to determine the fair value 2 the income approach which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts for example future cash flows or future earnings to a single present amount and 3 the cost approach which is based on the amount that would be required to replace an asset for many of our fair value estimates including our estimates of the fair value of acquired intangible assets we use the income approach using the income approach requires the use of financial models which require us to make various estimates including but not limited to 1 the potential future cash flows for the asset liability or equity instrument being measured 2 the timing of receipt or payment of those future cash flows 3 the time value of money associated with the delayed receipt or payment of such cash flows and 4 the inherent risk associated with the cash flows risk premium making these cash flow estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and if any of the estimates used to determine the fair value using the income approach turns out to be inaccurate our financial results may be negatively affected furthermore relatively small changes in many of these estimates can have a significant influence on the estimated fair value resulting from the financial models or the related accounting conclusion reached for example a relatively small change in the estimated fair value of an asset may change a conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired while we are required to make certain fair value assessments associated with the accounting for several types of transactions the following areas are the most sensitive to the assessments 

inventory obsolescence we regularly review inventory quantities onhand and in the retail channels and record an inventory provision for excess or obsolete inventory based on the future expected demand for our products significant changes in demand for our products would affect managements estimates in establishing our inventory provision we write down inventory based on excess or obsolete inventories determined primarily by future anticipated demand for our products inventory writedowns are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market value based upon assumptions about future demand that are inherently difficult to assess 

business combinations—goodwill and intangible assets we must estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these can have a material effect on our reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various lives furthermore a change in the estimated fair value of an asset or liability often has a direct influence on the amount to recognize as goodwill which is an asset that is not amortized often determining the fair value of these assets and liabilities assumed requires an assessment of expected use of the asset the expected cost to extinguish the liability or our expectations related to the timing and the successful completion of development of an acquired inprocess technology such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material influence on our financial statements 

we use either the income cost or market approach to aid in our conclusions of such fair values and asset lives the income approach presumes that the value of an asset can be estimated by the net economic benefit to be received over the life of the asset discounted to present value the cost approach presumes that an investor would pay no more for an asset than its replacement or reproduction cost the market approach estimates value based on what other participants in the market have paid for reasonably similar assets although each valuation approach is considered in valuing the assets acquired the approach ultimately selected is based on the characteristics of the asset and the availability of information 

we evaluate our goodwill annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount the determination of whether or not goodwill has become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units changes in our strategy andor market conditions could significantly affect these judgments and require reductions to recorded intangible asset balances 

longlived assets we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions including determining which cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset the useful life over which cash flows will occur their amount and the assets residual value if any in turn measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value which is based on the best information available we use internal discounted cash flow estimates quoted market prices when available and independent appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value we derive the required cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans and apply an appropriate discount rate 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment in estimating expected stock volatility and the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 

we have granted stock options to nonemployees which were subject to variable accounting when variable accounting is applied to stock option grants we remeasured the fair value of the unvested options at the end of each reporting period or until the options are cancelled or expire unexercised compensation expense in any given period was calculated as the difference between total earned compensation at the end of the period less total earned compensation at the beginning of the period both of which was based on the price of our common stock at such dates as a result fluctuations in the price of our common stock changed compensation expense recognized by us from period to period 

we have also granted time and marketbased restricted stock awards to employees and nonemployees timebased and marketbased awards to nonemployees are subject to variable accounting for the timebased restricted stock grants to nonemployees we cumulatively remeasure the fair value at the end of every period based on the month end closing price of our common stock marketbased restricted stock awards vest based on the relative performance of our common stock to a composite index we calculate the fair value of marketbased restricted stock using a monte carlo simulation method which requires a substantial number of inputs and estimates of future market conditions and considers the range of various vesting probabilities as a result expense recorded for our nonemployee awards can fluctuate substantially from period to period 

income taxes 

we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred income taxes are recognized for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at currently enacted statutory tax rates for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized our cumulative pretax loss in recent fiscal years represents sufficient evidence for us to 

determine that the establishment of a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset is appropriate this valuation allowance offsets deferred tax assets associated with future tax deductions as well as carryforward items 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in addition our filed tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 

we recognize and measure uncertain tax positions and record tax benefits when it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

at each period end it is necessary for us to make certain estimates and assumptions to compute the provision for income taxes including allocations of certain transactions to different tax jurisdictions amounts of permanent and temporary differences the likelihood of deferred tax assets being recovered and the outcome of contingent tax risks these estimates and assumptions are revised as new events occur more experience is acquired and additional information is obtained the effect of these revisions is recorded in income tax expense or benefit in the period in which they become known 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

comprehensive income 

on april 1 2012 the company adopted new guidance related to the presentation of comprehensive income the main provisions of the new guidance provide that an entity that reports items of other comprehensive income has the option to present comprehensive income as i a single statement that presents the components of net income and total net income the components of other comprehensive income and total other comprehensive income and a total for comprehensive income or ii in two separate but consecutive statements whereby an entity must present the components of net income and total net income in the first statement and that statement is immediately followed by a financial statement that presents the components of other comprehensive income a total for other comprehensive income and a total for comprehensive income the new rules eliminate the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of stockholders equity these new rules have been applied retrospectively and became effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2011 april 1 2012 for the company with early adoption permitted the adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

reclassification of accumulated other comprehensive income 

in february 2013 new guidance was issued requiring new disclosures about reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income this new guidance requires an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in addition an entity is required to present either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period for other amounts that are not required under us gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income an entity is required to crossreference to other disclosures required under us gaap that provide 

additional detail about those amounts the new guidance is effective prospectively for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2012 april 1 2013 for the company we do not expect the adoption of this new guidance to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

fluctuations in operating results and seasonality 

we have experienced fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results as a result of the timing of the introduction of new titles variations in sales of titles developed for particular platforms market acceptance of our titles development and promotional expenses relating to the introduction of new titles sequels or enhancements of existing titles projected and actual changes in platforms the timing and success of title introductions by our competitors product returns changes in pricing policies by us and our competitors the size and timing of acquisitions the timing of orders from major customers order cancellations and delays in product shipment sales of our products are also seasonal with peak shipments typically occurring in the fourth calendar quarter as a result of increased demand for titles during the holiday season quarterly and annual comparisons of operating results are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of net revenue represented by certain line items in our statements of operations net revenue by geographic region net revenue by platform and net revenue by distribution channel 



fiscal years ended march 31 2013 and 2012

financial condition 

we are subject to credit risks particularly if any of our receivables represent a limited number of customers or are concentrated in foreign markets if we are unable to collect our accounts receivable as they become due it could adversely affect our liquidity and working capital position 

generally we have been able to collect our accounts receivable in the ordinary course of business we do not hold any collateral to secure payment from customers we have trade credit insurance on the majority of our customers to mitigate accounts receivable risk 

a majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to major retailers and distributors our five largest customers accounted for 525 439 and 438 of net revenue during the fiscal years ended march 31 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively as of march 31 2013 and 2012 our five largest customers accounted for 572 and 613 of our gross accounts receivable respectively customers that individually accounted for more than 10 of our gross accounts receivable balance comprised 305 and 406 of 

such balances at march 31 2013 and 2012 respectively based upon performing ongoing credit evaluations maintaining trade credit insurance on a majority of our customers and our past collection experience we believe that the receivable balances from these largest customers do not represent a significant credit risk although we actively monitor each customers credit worthiness and economic conditions that may affect our customers business and access to capital we are monitoring the current global economic conditions including credit markets and other factors as it relates to our customers in order to manage the risk of uncollectible accounts receivable 

we believe our current cash and cash equivalents and projected cash flow from operations along with availability under our credit agreement will provide us with sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash requirements for working capital capital expenditures and commitments through at least the next 12 months 

as of march 31 2013 the amount of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the us by our foreign subsidiaries was approximately 1244 million these balances are dispersed across various locations around the world we believe that such dispersion meets the business and liquidity needs of our foreign affiliates in addition the company expects in the foreseeable future to have the ability to generate sufficient cash domestically to support ongoing operations consequently it is the companys intention to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries in the event the company needed to repatriate funds outside of the us such repatriation may be subject to local laws and tax consequences including foreign withholding taxes or us income taxes it is not practicable to estimate the tax liability and the company would try to minimize the tax effect to the extent possible however any repatriation may not result in actual cash payments as the taxable event would likely be offset by the utilization of the then available net operating losses and tax credits 

in january 2013 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 7500000 shares of our common stock the authorization permits the company to purchase shares from time to time through a variety of methods including in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable securities laws it does not obligate the company to make any purchases at any specific time or situation repurchases are subject to the availability of stock prevailing market conditions the trading price of the stock the companys financial performance and other conditions the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time for any reason through march 31 2013 the company has not repurchased any shares of our common stock as part of the program 

our changes in cash flows were as follows 



at march 31 2013 we had 4025 million of cash and cash equivalents compared to 4203 million at march 31 2012 the decrease in cash and cash equivalents from march 31 2012 was primarily a result of our higher accounts receivable balance at march 31 2013 primarily reflecting the release of bioshock infinite near the end of the fiscal year and the purchases of fixed assets partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accruals primarily related to bioshock infinite and royalties payable 

contractual obligations and commitments 

we have entered into various agreements in the ordinary course of business that require substantial cash commitments over the next several years generally these include 

• agreements to acquire licenses to intellectual property such as trademarks copyrights and technology for use in the publishing marketing and distribution of our software titles in addition we have certain minimum marketing support commitments where we commit to spend specified amounts related to marketing our products our licensing and marketing commitments primarily reflect agreements with major sports leagues and players associations and expire at various times through september 2018 • contractual payments to thirdparty software developers that expire at various times through september 2015 guaranteed minimum payments assume satisfactory performance • operating leases primarily related to occupancy furniture and equipment expiring at various times through march 2023 included in the cash commitments for operating leases below is a liability for a lease assumption without economic benefit which was approximately 18 million at march 31 2013 and is recorded in liabilities of discontinued operations on the consolidated balance sheet see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations and • purchase obligations primarily related to agreements to purchase services that are enforceable and legally binding on the company that specifies all significant terms including fixed minimum or variable pricing provisions and the approximate timing of the transactions expiring at various times through february 2016 a summary of annual minimum contractual obligations and commitments as of march 31 2013 is as follows in thousands of dollars 



in addition to the cash commitments above we have also entered into acquisition agreements that contain provisions for us to pay contingent cash consideration typically contingent on the acquired company achieving certain financial unit sales or performance conditions the amount and timing of these payments are currently not fixed or determinable see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our potential acquisition commitments 

income taxes at march 31 2013 the company had recorded a liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits of 143 million for which we are unable to make a reasonable and reliable estimate of the period in which these liabilities will be settled with the respective tax authorities therefore these liabilities have not been included in the contractual obligations table 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of march 31 2013 and 2012 we did not have any significant relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial parties such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities 

which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such we are not exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 

international operations 

net revenue earned outside of the united states is principally generated by our operations in europe asia australia canada and latin america for the fiscal years ended march 31 2013 2012 and 2011 approximately 415 456 and 455 respectively of our net revenue was earned outside the united states we are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade including increased credit risks tariffs and duties fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates shipping delays and international political regulatory and economic developments all of which can have a significant effect on our operating results 

fluctuations in quarterly operating results and seasonality 

we have experienced fluctuations in quarterly operating results as a result of the timing of the introduction of new titles variations in sales of titles developed for particular platforms market acceptance of our titles development and promotional expenses relating to the introduction of new titles sequels or enhancements of existing titles projected and actual changes in platforms the timing and success of title introductions by our competitors product returns changes in pricing policies by us and our competitors the accuracy of retailers forecasts of consumer demand the size and timing of acquisitions the timing of orders from major customers and order cancellations and delays in product shipment sales of our titles are also seasonal with peak shipments typically occurring in the fourth calendar quarter as a result of increased demand for titles during the holiday season quarterly comparisons of operating results are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential loss arising from fluctuations in market rates and prices our market risk exposures primarily include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

historically fluctuations in interest rates have not had a significant effect on our operating results under our credit agreement outstanding balances bear interest at our election of a 150 to 200 above a certain base rate 475 at march 31 2013 or b 250 to 300 above the libor rate approximately 270 at march 31 2013 with the margin rate subject to the achievement of certain average liquidity levels changes in market rates may affect our future interest expense if there is an outstanding balance on our line of credit the 175 convertible notes and the 4375 convertible notes pay interest semiannually at a fixed rate of 175 and 4375 respectively per annum and we expect that there will be no fluctuation related to the convertible notes affecting our cash component of interest expense for additional details on our convertible notes see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we transact business in foreign currencies and are exposed to risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates accounts relating to foreign operations are translated into united states dollars using prevailing exchange rates at the relevant period end translation adjustments are included as a separate component of stockholders equity for the fiscal year ended march 31 2013 our foreign currency translation loss adjustment was approximately 116 million we recognized a foreign currency exchange transaction loss for the fiscal years ended march 31 2013 and 2012 of 08 million and 13 million respectively and a foreign currency exchange transaction gain in interest and other net in our consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 of 14 million 

cash flow hedging activities 

we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with forecasted transactions involving nonfunctional currency denominated expenditures these contracts which are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts is reported as either assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets the effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these hedges is initially reported net of tax as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity the gross amount of the effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these hedges is subsequently reclassified into cost of goods sold or research and development expenses as appropriate in the period when the forecasted transaction is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations in the event that the gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income loss are deemed to be ineffective the ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value if any is reclassified to interest and other net in our consolidated statements of operations in the event that the underlying forecasted transactions do not occur or it becomes probable that they will not occur within the defined hedge period the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income loss to interest and other net in our consolidated statements of operations during the reporting periods all forecasted transactions occurred and therefore there were no such gains or losses reclassified into interest and other net we do not enter into derivative financial contracts for speculative or trading purposes at march 31 2013 and 2012 we had 79 million and 102 million respectively of forward contracts outstanding to buy foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars all of which have maturities of less than one year as of march 31 2013 and 2012 the fair value of these outstanding forward contracts was immaterial and is included in prepaid expenses and other the fair value of these outstanding forward contracts is estimated based on the prevailing exchange rates of the various hedged currencies as of the end of the period 

balance sheet hedging activities 

we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with nonfunctional currency denominated cash balances and intercompany funding loans nonfunctional currency denominated accounts receivable and nonfunctional currency denominated accounts payable these transactions are not designated as hedging instruments and are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts is reported as either assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value are reported in interest and other net in our consolidated statements of operations we do not enter into derivative financial contracts for speculative or trading purposes at march 31 2013 we had 554 million of forward contracts outstanding to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars all of which have maturities of less than one year at march 31 2012 we had 40 million of forward contracts outstanding to buy foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars and 283 million of forward contracts outstanding to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars all of which have maturities of less than one year for the fiscal years ended march 31 2013 and 2012 we recorded gains of 22 million and 07 million respectively and for the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 we recorded a loss of 69 million related to foreign currency forward contracts in interest and other net on the consolidated statements of operations as of march 31 2013 and 2012 the fair value of these outstanding forward contracts was immaterial and is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities the fair value of these outstanding forward contracts is estimated based on the prevailing exchange rates of the various hedged currencies as of the end of the period 

our hedging programs are designed to reduce but do not entirely eliminate the effect of currency exchange rate movements we believe the counterparties to these foreign currency forward contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks and that the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risks there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations for the fiscal year ended march 31 2013 415 of the companys revenue was generated outside the united states using sensitivity analysis a hypothetical 10 increase in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would decrease revenues by 42 while a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would increase revenues by 42 in the opinion of management a substantial portion of this fluctuation would be offset by cost of goods sold and operating expenses incurred in local currency

strategy 

overview we endeavor to be the most creative innovative and efficient company in our industry our core strategy is to capitalize on the popularity of video games by developing and publishing highquality interactive entertainment experiences across a range of genres we focus on building compelling entertainment franchises by publishing a select number of titles for which we can create sequels and addon content most of our intellectual property is internally owned and developed which we believe best positions us financially and competitively we have established a portfolio of proprietary software content for the major hardware platforms in a wide range of genres including action adventure racing roleplaying sports and strategy which we distribute worldwide we believe that our commitment to creativity and innovation is a distinguishing strength enabling us to differentiate our products in the marketplace by combining advanced technology with compelling storylines and characters that provide unique gameplay experiences for consumers we have created acquired or licensed a group of highly recognizable brands to match the broad consumer demographics we serve ranging from adults to children and game enthusiasts to casual gamers another cornerstone of our strategy is to support the success of our products in the marketplace through innovative marketing programs and global distribution on all platforms and through all channels that are relevant to our target audience 

support label structure to target distinct market segments our business consists of our whollyowned labels rockstar games and 2k which publishes its titles under 2k games 2k sports and 2k play each group focuses on distinct product genres and target demographics rockstar games is the developer and publisher of the interactive entertainment industrys most iconic and critically acclaimed brand grand theft auto  as well as other successful franchises including la noire  max payne  midnight club  and red dead  we expect rockstar games to continue to be a leader in the action  adventure product category and create groundbreaking entertainment by leveraging our existing franchises as well as developing new brands 2k games is the publisher of the critically acclaimed multimillion unit selling bioshock  borderlands  mafia  and sid meiers civilization franchises we expect 2k games to continue to be a leader in the shooter action roleplaying and strategy categories by building on its existing brands as well as developing new franchises in the future 2k sports publishes nba 2k  the topranked nba basketball video game for 11 years running as well as other sports titles including major league baseball 2k and top spin  2k play focuses on casual and familyfriendly games such as carnival games  an internally developed and owned franchise and licensed titles based on popular nickelodeon television programs we also have expansion initiatives in the rapidly growing asiapacific markets where our strategy is to broaden the distribution of our existing products expand our business in japan and establish an online gaming presence especially in china and korea 

focus on core strength of producing select high quality titles we focus on publishing a select number of highquality titles based on internallyowned and developed intellectual property which typically provide higher margins than licensed products we currently own the intellectual property rights of 19 proprietary brands in addition we will selectively develop titles based on licensed properties including sports and also publish externally developed titles 

we use a product investment review process to evaluate potential titles for investment to review existing titles in development and to assess titles after release to measure their performance in the market and the return on our investment we apply this process to all of our products whether internally or externally developed the product investment review process includes reviews of each project at various stages of development by our executive management team and senior management of our publishing labels and includes coordination between our sales and marketing personnel before the launch of the titles this disciplined approach to product investment is expected to enhance the competitiveness and profitability of our titles 

we develop our products using a combination of our internal and external development resources acting under contract with us we typically select our external developers based on their track record and expertise in developing products in the same category or genre one developer will generally produce the same game for multiple platforms and will also produce sequels to an original game we believe that selecting and using development resources in this manner allows us to leverage the particular expertise of our internal and external development resources which we believe increases the quality of our products 

leverage emerging technologies platforms and distribution channels including digitally delivered content interactive entertainment played on mobile platforms including tablets and smartphones and online platforms including social networks represent exciting opportunities to enhance our growth and profitability in addition the interactive entertainment industry is increasingly delivering content through digital download we are actively investing to capitalize on these trends in order to diversify our product mix reduce our operating risks and increase our revenue each of our labels has released offerings for tablets and smartphones across a variety of genres in december 2011 we released grand theft auto iii 10 th anniversary edition  which was our first title for android and our highestselling title for apples ios platform to date in july 2011 we launched our first social gaming experience sid meiers civilization world  for facebook and we have several initiatives underway to develop online games primarily for asian markets we will continue to invest in emerging opportunities in mobile and online gameplay particularly for our whollyowned franchises as well as downloadable content and micro 

transactions where gamers can pay to download additional content to enhance their game playing experience 

expand international business the global market for interactive entertainment continues to grow and we seek to increase our presence internationally particularly in asia eastern europe and latin america we have expansion initiatives in the asian markets where our strategy is to broaden the distribution of our existing products expand our business in japan and establish an online gaming presence especially in china and korea we are a direct publisher in japan and korea historically we distributed our products in asia through license agreements with local publishers in japan and korea and distribution agreements with local distributors of finished goods elsewhere in asia while we retain title to all intellectual property under license agreements local publishers are responsible for localization of software content distribution and marketing of the products in their respective local markets we intend to continue to build upon our licensing relationships and also expand finished goods distribution strategies to grow our international business 

our publishing and software development businesses 

revenue in our publishing business is primarily derived from the sale of internally developed software titles and software titles developed by thirdparties for our benefit operating margins in our publishing business are dependent in part upon our ability to continually release new commercially successful products and to manage software product development costs we have internal development studios located in australia canada china czech republic the united kingdom and the united states as of march 31 2012 we had a research and development staff of 1653 employees with the technical capabilities to develop software titles for all major current and prior generation consoles handheld hardware platforms and pcs in multiple languages and territories 

operating margins associated with our externally developed titles or titles for which we do not own the intellectual property are generally lower because they require us to acquire licenses provide minimum development guarantees and pay thirdparty royalties agreements with thirdparty developers generally give us exclusive publishing and marketing rights and require us to make development payments pay royalties based on product sales and satisfy other conditions development payments for software titles are typically recoupable against royalties otherwise due to developers based on software sales our agreements with thirdparty developers generally provide us with the right to monitor development efforts and to cease making development payments if specified development milestones are not satisfied we also regularly monitor the level of development payments in light of expected sales for the related titles 

the development cycle for our titles generally ranges from 12 to more than 24 months and our topselling titles could take up to 3 years or longer to develop although we often simultaneously develop our software for multiple platforms in certain cases it can take 9 to 12 months to adapt a product for additional hardware platforms after initial development for one platform is completed the cost to develop a frontline software title generally ranges from 10 million to 60 million with our top titles exceeding these amounts we expect that development costs and time will continue to increase for current generation platforms 

we continue to explore evolving business models such as downloadable content online gaming and microtransactions we expect downloadable content to become more prevalent as broadband connectivity continues to gain popularity and digital delivery platforms such as microsofts xbox live® marketplace xbox live and the sony entertainment network sen gain additional customers we also have expansion initiatives in the asiapacific markets where our strategy is to broaden the distribution of our existing products expand our business in japan and establish an online gaming presence especially in china and korea 

rockstar games software titles published by our rockstar games label are primarily internally developed we expect rockstar games our whollyowned publisher of the grand theft auto  max payne  midnight 

club  red dead and other popular franchises to continue to be a leader in the action  adventure product category and create groundbreaking entertainment by leveraging our existing titles as well as developing new brands we believe that rockstar has established a uniquely original popular cultural phenomenon with its grand theft auto series which we believe is the interactive entertainment industrys most iconic and critically acclaimed brand and has soldin approximately 120 million units rockstar continues to expand on our established franchises by releasing sequels as well as offering downloadable episodes and content in may 2011 rockstar released the commercially successful and critically acclaimed la noire  which became the first video game ever chosen as an official selection of the tribeca film festival rockstar has released several downloadable content packs to support that title rockstar is also well known for developing brands in other genres including the bully and manhunt franchises 

2k our 2k label publishes its titles under 2k games 2k sports and 2k play

2k sports 2k sports publishes realistic sports simulation titles including our flagship nba 2k series which has been the topranked nba basketball video game for 11 years running the major league baseball 2k series and our top spin tennis series we develop most of our 2k sports software titles through our internal development studios 2k sports has secured longterm licensing agreements with the national basketball association nba our current licenses with major league baseball properties the major league baseball players association and major league baseball advanced media expire in fiscal 2013 

we also have expansion initiatives in the rapidly growing asia markets where our strategy is to broaden the distribution of our existing products expand our business in japan and establish an online gaming presence especially in china and korea 2k sports has secured a multiyear license from the nba to develop an online version of the nba simulation game in china taiwan south korea and southeast asia 

2k play 2k play focuses on developing and publishing titles for the casual and familyfriendly games market 2k play titles are developed by both internal development studios and thirdparty developers internally developed titles include carnival games and lets cheer  2k play also has a partnership with nickelodeon to publish video games based on its top rated nick jr titles such as dora the explorer  go diego go  ni hao kailan and the backyardigans  we expect familyoriented gaming to continue to be a component of our business in the future 

discontinued operations 

in february 2010 we completed the sale to synnex corporation synnex of our jack of all games thirdparty distribution business which primarily distributed thirdparty interactive entertainment software hardware and accessories in north america for approximately 440 million including 373 million in cash subject to purchase price adjustments and up to an additional 67 million subject to the achievement of certain items which were not met in april 2011 we settled on the purchase price adjustments and as a result the purchase price was lowered by 15 million consequently the net purchase price after the settlement was 358 million the financial results of this business which were previously reported as our distribution business have been classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented the assets and liabilities of this business are reflected as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations 

intellectual property 

our business is highly dependent on the creation acquisition licensing and protection of intellectual property some of the intellectual property rights we have created or acquired for our internallyowned portfolio of brands are bioshock  bully  carnival games  the darkness  grand theft auto  la noire  mafia  manhunt  max payne  midnight club  red dead  rockstar games presents table tennis  sid meiers civilization  sid meiers pirates  spec ops  and top spin  we believe that content ownership facilitates our internal product development efforts and maximizes profit potential we attempt to protect our software and production techniques under copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as through contractual restrictions on disclosure copying and distribution although we generally do not hold any patents we obtain trademark and copyright registrations for many of our products 

we also enter into content license agreements such as those with sports leagues and players associations movie studios and performing talent music labels and musicians these licenses are typically limited to use of the licensed rights in products for specific time periods in addition we license and include console manufacturer technology in our products on a nonexclusive basis which allows our games to be played on their respective hardware systems 

manufacturing 

sony microsoft and nintendo either manufacture or control selection of approved manufacturers of software products sold for use on their respective hardware platforms we place a purchase order for the manufacture of our products with sony microsoft or nintendo and then send software code and a prototype of the product to the manufacturer together with related artwork user instructions warranty information brochures and packaging designs for approval defect testing and manufacture games are generally shipped within two to three weeks of receipt of our purchase order and all materials

we occasionally experience difficulties or delays in the manufacture of our titles however such delays have not significantly harmed our business to date we have not experienced material delays due to manufacturing defects our software titles typically carry a 90day limited warranty 

sales 

we sell software titles to retail outlets in north america europe and asia through direct relationships with large retail customers and thirdparty distributors our customers in north america include leading mass merchandisers such as walmart specialty retailers such as gamestop electronics stores such as best buy toy stores such as toys r us national and regional drug stores rental outlets and supermarket and discount store chains our european customers include game gamestop gem distribution and media markt we have sales operations in asia australia austria canada france germany the netherlands new zealand spain switzerland the united kingdom and the united states 

we are dependent on a limited number of customers that account for a significant portion of our sales sales to our five largest customers during the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 accounted for approximately 439 of our net revenue with gamestop and walmart accounting for 190 and 107 respectively no other customer accounted for more than 100 of our net revenue during the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 

we also digitally distribute our titles downloadable content and microtransactions direct to consoles and pcs including smartphones and tablets we view digital distribution as an important growth opportunity 

for our industry and company however we continue to expect that packaged goods and traditional retailers will be the primary channel for the sale of our products for the foreseeable future 

marketing 

our marketing and promotional efforts are intended to maximize consumer interest in our titles promote brand name recognition of our franchises assist retailers and properly position package and merchandise our titles 

we market titles by 

• implementing public relations campaigns using print and online advertising television radio spots and outdoor advertising we believe that we label and market our products in accordance with the applicable principles and guidelines of the entertainment software rating board or the esrb an independent selfregulatory body that assigns ratings and enforces advertising guidelines for the interactive software industry • satisfying certain shelf life and sales requirements under our agreements with hardware manufacturers in order to qualify for sonys greatest hits programs and microsofts platinum hits program in connection with these programs we receive manufacturing discounts from sony and microsoft • stimulating continued sales by reducing the wholesale prices of our products to retailers at various times during the life of a product price concessions may occur at any time in a products life cycle but typically occur three to nine months after a products initial launch during the fiscal years ended march 31 2012 2011 and 2010 five months ended march 31 2010 and fiscal year ended october 31 2009 price concessions to retailers amounted to 860 million 599 million 611 million 532 million and 494 million respectively in certain international markets we also provide volume rebates to stimulate continued product sales • employing various other marketing methods designed to promote consumer awareness including social media instore promotions and pointofpurchase displays direct mail cooperative advertising as well as attendance at trade shows in addition to our media retail and public relations campaigns an important part of our marketing strategy leverages evolving business models such as downloadable addon content for our front line titles addon content generates incremental revenues and also helps to prolong consumer engagement with our titles which extends the life of each new release and enhances the value of our franchises as of march 31 2012 we had a sales and marketing staff of 283 people 

product procurement 

we procure products from suppliers principally using standard purchase orders based on our assessment of market demand as well as preorders from retailers we carry inventory quantities that we believe are necessary to provide rapid response to retailer orders we utilize electronic data interchange with many of our customers to enhance the efficiency of placing and shipping orders and receiving payments 

competition 

in our publishing business we compete with 

• companies that range in size and cost structure from very small with limited resources to very large companies with greater financial marketing and technical personnel and other resources than ours including activision blizzard electronic arts and thq and international companies such as capcom konami namcobandai sega square enix and ubisoft 7 

• sony microsoft and nintendo for licenses to properties and the sale of interactive entertainment software each of which is a large developer and marketer of software for its own platforms each of these competitors has the financial resources to withstand significant price competition and to implement extensive advertising campaigns • other software hardware entertainment and media for limited retail shelf space and promotional resources the competition is intense among an increasing number of newly introduced entertainment software titles and hardware for adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support • other forms of entertainment such as motion pictures television and audio online computer programs and other forms of entertainment which may be less expensive or provide other advantages to consumers competition in the entertainment software industry is based on innovation features playability and product quality brand name recognition compatibility with popular platforms access to distribution channels price marketing and customer service our business is driven by hit titles which require increasing budgets for development and marketing competition for our titles is influenced by the timing of competitive product releases and the similarity of such products to our titles and may result in loss of shelf space or a reduction in sellthrough of our titles at retail stores 

trends and factors affecting our business 

product release schedule our financial results are affected by the timing of our product releases and the commercial success of those titles our grand theft auto products in particular have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue sales of grand theft auto products generated approximately 138 of the companys net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 the timing of our grand theft auto releases varies significantly which in turn may affect our financial performance on a quarterly and annual basis 

economic environment and retailer performance we continue to monitor economic conditions that may unfavorably affect our businesses such as deteriorating consumer demand pricing pressure on our products credit quality of our receivables and foreign currency exchange rates our business is dependent upon a limited number of customers who account for a significant portion of our revenue our five largest customers accounted for 439 438 598 557 and 564 of net revenue during the fiscal years ended march 31 2012 2011 and 2010 five months ended march 31 2010 and fiscal year ended october 31 2009 respectively as of march 31 2012 and 2011 our five largest customers accounted for 613 and 542 of our gross accounts receivable respectively customers that individually accounted for more than 10 of our gross accounts receivable balance comprised 406 and 382 of such balances at march 31 2012 and 2011 respectively the economic environment has affected our customers in the past and may do so in the future bankruptcies or consolidations of our large retail customers could seriously hurt our business due to uncollectible accounts receivables and the concentration of purchasing power among the remaining large retailers certain of our large customers sell used copies of our games which may negatively affect our business by reducing demand for new copies of our games while the downloadable episodes that we now offer for certain of our titles may serve to reduce used game sales we expect used game sales to continue to affect our business 

hardware platforms the majority of our products are made for the hardware platforms developed by three companies—sony microsoft and nintendo note 16 to our consolidated financial statements segment and geographic information discloses that sony microsoft and nintendo hardware platforms comprised approximately 894 of the companys net revenue by product platform for the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 the success of our business is dependent upon the consumer acceptance of these platforms and the continued growth in the installed base of these platforms when new hardware platforms are introduced demand for software based on older platforms declines which may negatively 

affect our business additionally our development costs are generally higher for titles based on new platforms and we have limited ability to predict the consumer acceptance of the new platforms which may affect our sales and profitability as a result we believe it is important to focus our development efforts on a select number of titles which is consistent with our strategy 

online content and digital distribution the interactive entertainment software industry is delivering a growing amount of content through digital online delivery methods we provide a variety of online delivered products and services a number of our titles that are available through retailers as packaged goods products are also available through direct digital download through the internet from websites we own and others owned by thirdparties we also offer downloadable addon content to our packaged goods titles in addition in july 2011 we launched our first social gaming experience sid meiers civilization world  for facebook and we have several initiatives underway to develop online games primarily for asian markets we expect online delivery of games and game services to become an increasing part of our business over the longterm 

international operations 

international sales are a significant part of our business for the fiscal years ended march 31 2012 2011 and 2010 five months ended march 31 2010 and fiscal year ended october 31 2009 approximately 456 455 404 356 and 428 respectively of our net revenue was earned outside the united states we have also expanded our asian operations in an effort to increase our geographical scope and diversify our revenue base we are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade including increased credit risks tariffs and duties fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates shipping delays and international political regulatory and economic developments all of which can have a significant effect on our operating results see notes 1 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

segment and geographic information 

see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

employees 

as of march 31 2012 we had 2235 fulltime employees of which 1140 were employed outside of the united states none of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements we consider our relations with employees to be satisfactory 




 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties which may affect our future financial performance because of the risks and uncertainties described below as well as other factors affecting our operating results and financial condition past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and our business and financial performance could be harmed and the market value of our securities could decline 

risks relating to our business 

we are dependent on the future success of our grand theft auto products and we must continue to publish hit titles or sequels to such hit titles in order to compete successfully in our industry 

grand theft auto and certain of our other titles are hit products and have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue sales of grand theft auto products generated approximately 138 of the companys net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 and the ten bestselling titles including grand theft auto  that significantly contributed to the companys net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 in the aggregate accounted for approximately 897 of the companys net revenue if we fail to continue to develop and sell new commercially successful hit titles or sequels to such hit titles or experience any delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of our hit titles or their sequels our revenue and profits may decrease substantially and we may incur losses in addition competition in our industry is intense and a relatively small number of hit titles account for a large portion of total revenue in our industry hit products offered by our competitors may take a larger share of consumer spending than we anticipate which could cause revenue generated from our products to fall below our expectations if our competitors develop more successful products or services at lower price points or based on payment models perceived as offering better value or if we do not continue to develop consistently high quality and wellreceived products and services our revenue and profitability may decline in addition both the online and mobile games marketplaces are characterized by frequent product introductions relatively low barriers to entry and new and evolving business methods technologies and platforms for development widespread consumer adoption of these new platforms for games and other technological advances in online or mobile game offerings could negatively affect our sales of console and traditional pc products before we have an opportunity to develop profitable businesses in such markets 

we are subject to product development risks which could result in delays and additional costs and we must adapt to changes in software technologies 

we depend on our internal development studios and thirdparty software developers to develop new interactive entertainment software within anticipated release schedules and cost projections the development cycle for new titles generally ranges from 12 to more than 24 months and our topselling titles could take up to 3 years or longer to develop development times and costs of current generation software have increased substantially as a result of the additional and enhanced features available in the newest games further after development of a product it may take between 9 and 12 additional months to develop the product for other hardware platforms if our thirdparty software developers experience unanticipated development delays financial difficulties or additional costs we will not be able to release titles according to our schedule and at budgeted costs certain of our licensing and marketing agreements also contain provisions that would impose penalties if we fail to meet agreed upon game release dates there can be no assurance that our products will be sufficiently successful so that we can recoup these costs or make a profit on these products 

additionally in order to stay competitive our internal development studios must anticipate and adapt to rapid technological changes affecting software development any inability to respond to technological advances and implement new technologies could render our products obsolete or less marketable 

the inability of our products to achieve significant market acceptance delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of our products may have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

new products may not achieve significant market acceptance generate sufficient sales or be introduced in a timely manner to permit us to recover development manufacturing and marketing costs associated with these products the life cycle of a title generally involves a relatively high level of sales during the first few months after introduction followed by a rapid decline in sales because revenue associated with an initial product launch generally constitutes a high percentage of the total revenue associated with the life of a product delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of one or more new products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cause our operating results to be materially different from our expectations 

our business is subject to the continued popularity of current generation video game platforms and our ability to develop commercially successful products for these platforms 

we derive most of our revenue from the sale of products made for video game platforms manufactured by thirdparties such as sonys ps3 microsofts xbox 360 and nintendos wii note 16 to our consolidated financial statements segment and geographic information discloses that sony microsoft and nintendo hardware platforms comprised approximately 894 of the companys net revenue by product platform for the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 the success of our business is subject to the continued popularity of these platforms and our ability to develop commercially successful products for these platforms 

connectivity issues related to digital delivery platforms could affect our ability to sell and provide online services for our products and could affect our profitability 

we rely upon thirdparty digital delivery platforms such as xbox live and sen to provide connectivity from the consumer to our digital products and our online services connectivity issues could prevent customers from accessing this content and our ability to successfully market and sell our products could be adversely affected in addition we could experience similar issues related to services we host on our internal servers such issues also could affect our ability to provide online services and could affect our business 

our business could be adversely affected if our consumer data protection measures are not seen as adequate or there are breaches of our security measures or unintended disclosures of our consumer data 

we are collecting and storing consumer information including personal information and credit card information we take measures to protect our consumer data from unauthorized access or disclosure it is possible that our security controls over consumer data may not prevent the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information in addition due to the high profile nature of our products we may draw a disproportionately higher amount of attention and attempts to breach our security controls than companies with lower profile products a security breach that leads to disclosure of consumer account information including personally identifiable information could harm our reputation compel us to comply with disparate breach notification laws in various jurisdictions and otherwise subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue a resulting perception that our products or services do not adequately protect the privacy of personal information could result in a loss of current or potential consumers and business partners in addition if any of our business partners experience a security breach that leads to disclosure of consumer account information our reputation could be harmed resulting in loss of revenue 

the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the us europe and elsewhere are often uncertain contradictory and in flux it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices if so this could result in government imposed fines or orders requiring that we change our data practices which could have an adverse effect on 

our business complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business 

in addition certain of our products are onlineenabled the ability of our products to offer online functionality and our ability to offer content through a video game platforms digital distribution channel is dependent upon the continued operation and security of such platforms online network these thirdparty networks as well as our own internal systems and websites and the security measures related thereto may be breached as a result of thirdparty action including intentional misconduct by computer hackers employee error malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers data or our data including our intellectual property and other confidential business information or our information technology systems because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs we may lose business suffer irreparable damage to our reputation andor incur significant costs and expenses relating to the investigation and possible litigation of claims relating to such event 

security breaches involving the source code for our products could adversely affect our revenues 

we securely store the source code for our interactive entertainment software products as it is created a breach whether physical electronic or otherwise of the systems on which such source code and other sensitive data are stored could lead to damage or piracy of our software if we are subject to data security breaches we may have a loss in sales or increased costs arising from the restoration or implementation of additional security measures which could materially and adversely affect our profitability any theft andor unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an event could adversely affect our competitive position reputation brand and future sales of our products our business could be subject to significant disruption and we could suffer monetary and other losses and reputational harm in the event of such incidents and claims 

if we are unable to sustain launch pricing on current generation titles our operating results may suffer 

the interactive entertainment software and hardware industry is characterized by the introduction of new and enhanced generations of products and evolving industry standards current generation titles for the ps3 xbox 360 and wii have been offered at premium retail prices since the launch of such consoles we expect to continue to price current generation titles at a premium level however circumstances may arise in which we may need to reduce prices for such titles if we are unable to sustain launch pricing on these current generation titles it will have a material adverse effect on our margins profitability and operating results 

we depend on our key management and product development personnel 

our continued success will depend to a significant extent on our senior management team and our relationship with zelnickmedia corporation zelnickmedia our executive chairman and chief executive officer and chief operating officer are partners of zelnickmedia we are also highly dependent on the expertise skills and knowledge of certain of our rockstar employees and other key creative personnel responsible for content creation and development of our grand theft auto titles and titles based on other brands we may not be able to continue to retain these personnel at current compensation levels or at all 

the loss of the services of our executive officers zelnickmedia our key rockstar employees or other key creative personnel could significantly harm our business in addition if one or more key employees were to join a competitor or form a competing company we may lose additional personnel experience material interruptions in product development delays in bringing products to market and difficulties in our relationships with licensors suppliers and customers which would significantly harm our business failure 

to continue to attract and retain other qualified management and creative personnel could adversely affect our business and prospects 

declines in consumer spending and other adverse changes in the economy could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 

most of our products involve discretionary spending on the part of consumers we believe that consumer spending is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income this makes our products particularly sensitive to general economic conditions and economic cycles as consumers are generally more willing to make discretionary purchases including purchases of products like ours during periods in which favorable economic conditions prevail adverse economic conditions such as a prolonged us or international general economic downturn including periods of increased inflation unemployment levels tax rates interest rates energy prices or declining consumer confidence could also reduce consumer spending reduced consumer spending has and may continue to result in reduced demand for our products and may also require increased selling and promotional expenses which has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results furthermore uncertainty and adverse changes in the economy could also increase the risk of material losses on our investments increase costs associated with developing and publishing our products increase the cost and availability of sources of financing and increase our exposure to material losses from bad debts any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results if economic conditions worsen our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 

our quarterly operating results are dependent on the release of hit titles and are highly seasonal which may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate significantly 

we have experienced and may continue to experience wide fluctuations in quarterly operating results the release of a hit title typically leads to a high level of sales during the first few months after introduction followed by a rapid decline in sales in addition the interactive entertainment industry is highly seasonal with sales typically higher during the fourth calendar quarter due primarily to increased demand for games during the holiday season demand for and sales of our sports titles are also seasonal in that they are typically released just prior to the start of the sport season which they depict if a key event or sports season to which our product release schedule is tied were to be delayed or cancelled our sales would also suffer disproportionately our failure or inability to produce hit titles or introduce products on a timely basis to meet seasonal fluctuations in demand could adversely affect our business and operating results the uncertainties associated with software development manufacturing lead times production delays and the approval process for products by hardware manufacturers and other licensors make it difficult to predict the quarter in which our products will ship and therefore may cause us to fail to meet financial expectations 

returns of our published titles by our customers and price concessions granted to our customers may adversely affect our operating results 

we are exposed to the risk of product returns and price concessions with respect to our customers our distribution arrangements with customers generally do not give them the right to return titles to us or to cancel firm orders however we sometimes accept product returns from our distribution customers for stock balancing and negotiate accommodations for customers which include credits and returns when demand for specific products falls below expectations we accept returns and grant price concessions in connection with our publishing arrangements and revenue is recognized after deducting estimated reserves for returns and price concessions while we believe that we can reliably estimate future returns and price concessions if return rates and price concessions for our products exceed our reserves our revenue could decline 

increased sales of used video game products could lower our sales 

certain of our larger customers sell used video games which are generally priced lower than new video games if our customers continue to increase their sales of used video games it could negatively affect our sales of new video games and have an adverse influence on our operating results 

a limited number of customers account for a significant portion of our sales the loss of a principal customer could seriously hurt our business 

a substantial portion of our product sales are made to a limited number of customers sales to our five largest customers during the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 accounted for approximately 439 of our net revenue with gamestop and walmart accounting for 190 and 107 respectively our sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders without longterm agreements or other commitments and our customers may terminate their relationship with us at any time certain of our customers may decline to carry products containing mature content the loss of our relationships with principal customers or a decline in sales to principal customers including as a result of a product being rated ao age 18 and over could materially adversely affect our business and operating results furthermore our customers may also be placed into bankruptcy become insolvent or be liquidated due to economic downturns global contractions of credit or for other factors bankruptcies or consolidations of certain large retail customers could seriously hurt our business including as a result of uncollectible accounts receivable from such customers and the concentration of purchasing power among remaining large retailers in addition our results of operations may be adversely affected if certain of our customers who purchase on credit terms are no longer eligible to purchase on such terms due to their financial distress which may reduce the quantity of products they demand from us 

if our marketing and advertising efforts fail to resonate with our customers our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

our products are marketed worldwide through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs such as television and online advertising print advertising retail merchandising website development and event sponsorship our ability to sell our products and services is dependent in part on the success of these programs if the marketing for our products and services fails to resonate with our customers particularly during the holiday season or other key selling periods or if advertising rates or other media placement costs increase these factors could have a material adverse influence on our business and operating results 

the interactive entertainment software industry is highly competitive 

we compete for both licenses to properties and the sale of interactive entertainment software with sony microsoft and nintendo each of which is a large developer and marketer of software for its own platforms we also compete with domestic game publishers such as activision blizzard electronic arts and thq and international publishers such as capcom konami namcobandai sega square enix and ubisoft as our business is dependent upon our ability to develop hit titles which require increasing budgets for development and marketing the availability of significant financial resources has become a major competitive factor in developing and marketing software games some of our competitors have greater financial technical personnel and other resources than we do and are able to finance larger budgets for development and marketing and make higher offers to licensors and developers for commercially desirable properties our titles also compete with other forms of entertainment such as social media and casual games in addition to motion pictures television and audio and video products featuring similar themes online computer programs and other entertainment which may be less expensive or provide other advantages to consumers 

a number of software publishers who compete with us have developed and commercialized or are currently developing online games for use by consumers over the internet if technological advances 

significantly increase the availability of online games and if consumer acceptance of online gaming grows substantially it could result in a decline in our platformbased software sales and negatively affect sales of such products 

increased competition for limited shelf space and promotional support from retailers could affect the success of our business and require us to incur greater expenses to market our titles 

retailers have limited shelf space and promotional resources and competition is intense among newly introduced interactive entertainment software titles for adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support competition for retail shelf space is expected to continue to increase which may require us to increase our marketing expenditures to maintain desirable sales levels of our titles competitors with more extensive lines and more popular titles may have greater bargaining power with retailers accordingly we may not be able or we may have to pay more than our competitors to achieve similar levels of promotional support and shelf space 

our business is dependent on our ability to enter into successful software development arrangements with thirdparties 

our success depends on our ability to continually identify and develop new titles on a timely basis we rely on thirdparty software developers for the development of some of our titles quality thirdparty developers are continually in high demand software developers who have developed titles for us in the past may not be available to develop software for us in the future due to the limited number of thirdparty software developers and the limited control that we exercise over them these developers may not be able to complete titles for us on a timely basis or within acceptable quality standards if at all we have entered into agreements with thirdparties to acquire the rights to publish and distribute interactive entertainment software as well as to use licensed intellectual properties in our titles these agreements typically require us to make development payments pay royalties and satisfy other conditions our development payments may not be sufficient to permit developers to develop new software successfully which could result in material delays and significantly increase our costs to bring particular products to market software development costs promotion and marketing expenses and royalties payable to software developers and thirdparty licensors have increased significantly in recent years and reduce potential profits derived from sales of our software future sales of our titles may not be sufficient to recover development payments and advances to software developers and licensors and we may not have adequate financial and other resources to satisfy our contractual commitments to such developers if we fail to satisfy our obligations under agreements with thirdparty developers and licensors the agreements may be terminated or modified in ways that are burdensome to us and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 

we cannot publish our titles without the approval of hardware licensors that are also our competitors 

we are required to obtain licenses from sony microsoft and nintendo which are also our competitors to develop and publish titles for their respective hardware platforms our existing platform licenses require that we obtain approval for the publication of new titles on a titlebytitle basis as a result the number of titles we are able to publish for these hardware platforms our ability to manage the timing of the release of these titles and accordingly our net revenue from titles for these hardware platforms may be limited if a licensor chooses not to renew or extend our license agreement at the end of its current term or if a licensor were to terminate our license for any reason or does not approve one or more of our titles we may be unable to publish that title as well as additional titles for that licensors platform termination of any such agreements or disapproval of titles could seriously hurt our business and prospects we may be unable to continue to enter into license agreements for certain current generation platforms on satisfactory terms or at all failure to enter into any such agreement could also seriously hurt our business 

our platform licensors control the fee structures for online distribution of our games on their platforms 

certain platform licensors have retained the right to change the fee structures for online distribution of both paid content and free content including patches and corrections on their platforms each licensors ability to set royalty rates may increase costs which could negatively affect our operating margins we may be unable to distribute our content in a costeffective or profitable manner through this distribution channel which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we may not be able to adequately adjust our cost structure in a timely fashion in response to a sudden decrease in demand 

in the event of a significant decline in revenue we may not be able to dispose of facilities reduce personnel or make other changes to our cost structure without disruption to our operations or without significant termination and exit costs management may not be able to implement such actions in a timely manner if at all to offset an immediate shortfall in revenue and profit moreover reducing costs may impair our ability to produce and develop software titles at sufficient levels in the future 

we submit our products for rating by the entertainment software rating board esrb in the united states and other voluntary or government ratings organizations in foreign countries failure to obtain a target rating for certain of our products could negatively affect our ability to distribute and sell those games as could the rerating of a game for any reason 

we voluntarily submit our game products to the esrb a usbased nonprofit and independent ratings organization the esrb system provides consumers with information about game content using a rating symbol that generally suggests the appropriate player age group and specific content descriptors such as graphic violence profanity or sexually explicit material the esrb may impose significant penalties on game publishers for violations of its rules related to rating or marketing games including revocation of a rating or monetary fines up to 1 million other countries require voluntary or government backed ratings as prerequisites for product sales in some instances we may have to modify our products in order to market them under the target rating which could delay or disrupt the release of our products in addition some of our titles may not be sold at all or without extensive edits in certain countries such as germany 

in the united states if the esrb rates a game as ao age 18 and older platform licensors may not certify the game and retailers may refuse to sell it in addition some consumers have reacted to reratings or controversial game content by refusing to purchase such games demanding refunds for games that they had already purchased and refraining from buying other games published by us many of our rockstar titles and certain of our 2k games titles have been rated m age 17 and older by the esrb if we are unable to obtain m ratings and instead receive ao ratings on future versions of those or similar titles as a result of changes in the esrbs ratings standards or for other reasons including the adoption of legislation in this area our business and prospects could be negatively affected if any of our games are rerated by the esrb or other foreign based ratings organizations we could be exposed to litigation administrative fines and penalties and other potential liabilities and our operating results and financial condition could be significantly affected 

we have implemented processes to comply with the requirements of the esrb and other ratings organizations and properly display the designated rating symbols and content descriptions nonetheless these processes are subject to human error circumvention overriding and reasonable resource constraints if a video game we published were found to contain undisclosed pertinent content the esrb could rerate a game retailers could refuse to sell it and demand that we accept the return of any unsold copies or returns from customers and consumers could refuse to buy it or demand that we refund their money this could have a material negative affect on our operating results and financial condition in addition we may be exposed to litigation administrative fines and penalties and our reputation could be harmed which could affect sales of other video games we sell if any of these consequences were to occur our business and financial performance could be significantly harmed 

content policies adopted by retailers consumer opposition and litigation could negatively affect sales of our products 

retailers may decline to sell interactive entertainment software containing what they judge to be graphic violence or sexually explicit material or other content that they deem inappropriate for their businesses if retailers decline to sell our products based upon their opinion that they contain objectionable themes graphic violence or sexually explicit material or other generally objectionable content or if any of our previously m rated series products are rated ao we might be required to significantly change or discontinue particular titles or series which in the case of our bestselling grand theft auto titles could seriously affect our business consumer advocacy groups have opposed sales of interactive entertainment software containing objectionable themes violence or sexual material or other objectionable content by pressing for legislation in these areas and by engaging in public demonstrations and media campaigns additionally although lawsuits seeking damages for injuries allegedly suffered by thirdparties as a result of video games have generally been unsuccessful in the courts claims of this kind have been asserted against us from time to time and may be asserted and be successful in the future 

we are subject to risks and uncertainties of international trade including fluctuations in the values of local foreign currencies against the dollar 

sales in international markets primarily in europe have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue note 16 to our consolidated financial statements segment and geographic information discloses that sales in europe comprised approximately 298 of the companys net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 we have also expanded our asian operations in an effort to increase our geographical scope and diversify our revenue base we are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade including increased credit risks tariffs and duties fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates shipping delays and international political regulatory and economic developments all of which can have a significant influence on our operating results many of our international sales are made in local currencies which could fluctuate against the dollar while we may use forward exchange contracts to a limited extent to seek to mitigate foreign currency risk our operating results could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations 

we face risks from our international operations 

we are subject to certain risks because of our international operations particularly as we continue to grow our business and presence in asia latin america and other parts of the world changes to and compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations may increase our cost of doing business and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals could harm our international and domestic sales trade legislation in either the united states or other countries such as a change in the current tariff structures importexport compliance laws or other trade laws or policies could adversely affect our ability to sell or to distribute in international markets we incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our international operations and could become subject to legal penalties in foreign countries if we do not comply with local laws and regulations which may be substantially different from those in the united states in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it may be common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by united states laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and by local laws such as laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations including those based in or from countries where practices which violate such laws may be customary will not take actions in violation of our policies any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could have a material adverse effect on our business 

if we are unable to protect the intellectual property relating to our software the commercial value of our products will be adversely affected and our competitive position could be harmed 

we develop proprietary software and have obtained the rights to publish and distribute software developed by thirdparties we attempt to protect our software and production techniques under copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as through contractual restrictions on disclosure copying and distribution our software is susceptible to piracy and unauthorized copying unauthorized thirdparties may be able to copy or to reverse engineer our software to obtain and use programming or production techniques that we regard as proprietary well organized piracy operations have also proliferated in recent years resulting in the ability to download pirated copies of our software over the internet although we attempt to incorporate protective measures into our software piracy of our products could negatively affect our future profitability 

if we infringe on or are alleged to infringe on the intellectual property rights of thirdparties our business could be adversely affected 

as our industry grows we may be subject to an increasing amount of litigation that is common in the software industry based on allegations of infringement or other alleged violations of patent copyright andor trademarks in addition we believe that interactive entertainment software will increasingly become the subject of claims that such software infringes on the intellectual property rights of others with both the growth of online functionality and advances in technology game content and software graphics as games become more realistic from time to time we receive notices from thirdparties or are named in lawsuits by thirdparties alleging infringement of their proprietary rights although we believe that our software and technologies and the software and technologies of thirdparty developers and publishers with whom we have contractual relations do not and will not infringe or violate proprietary rights of others it is possible that infringement of proprietary rights of others may occur any claims of infringement with or without merit could be time consuming costly and difficult to defend moreover intellectual property litigation or claims could require us to discontinue the distribution of products obtain a license or redesign our products which could result in additional substantial costs and material delays 

our software is susceptible to errors which can harm our financial results and reputation 

the technological advancements of new hardware platforms result in the development of more complex software products as software products become more complex the risk of undetected errors in new products increases we may need to produce and distribute patches in order to repair such errors which could be costly and may distract our developers from working on new products if despite testing errors are found in new products or releases after shipments have been made we could experience a loss of or delay in timely market acceptance product returns loss of revenue increases in costs relating to the repair of such errors and damage to our reputation 

if we acquire or invest in other businesses intellectual properties or other assets we may be unable to integrate them with our business our financial performance may be impaired andor we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for such transactions 

if appropriate opportunities present themselves we may acquire or make investments in businesses intellectual properties and other assets that we believe are strategic we may not be able to identify negotiate or finance any future acquisition or investment successfully even if we do succeed in acquiring or investing in a business intellectual property or other asset such acquisitions and investments involve a number of risks including 

• retaining key employees and maintaining the key business and customer relationships of the businesses we acquire • cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from an acquired company or business into our organization 18 

• the possibility that the combined company would not achieve the expected benefits including any anticipated operating and product synergies of the acquisition as quickly as anticipated or that the costs of or operational difficulties arising from an acquisition would be greater than anticipated • significant acquisitionrelated accounting adjustments particularly relating to an acquired companys deferred revenue that may cause reported revenue and profits of the combined company to be lower than the sum of their standalone revenue and profits • significant accounting charges resulting from the completion and integration of a sizeable acquisition and increased capital expenditures including potential impairment charges incurred to write down the carrying amount of intangible assets generated as a result of an acquisition • the possibility that we will not discover important facts during due diligence that could have a material adverse effect on the value of the businesses we acquire including the possibility that a change of control of a company we acquire triggers a termination of contractual or intellectual property rights important to the operation of its business • the need to integrate an acquired companys accounting management information human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management and timely reporting and the need to implement or remediate controls procedures and policies appropriate for a public company in an acquired company that prior to the acquisition lacked these controls procedures and policies • litigation or other claims in connection with or inheritance of claims or litigation risks as a result of an acquisition including claims from terminated employees customers or other thirdparties and • to the extent that we engage in strategic transactions outside of the united states we face additional risks including risks related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages currency risks and the particular economic political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries future acquisitions and investments could also involve the issuance of our equity and equitylinked securities potentially diluting our existing stockholders the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses writeoffs of goodwill intangibles or acquired inprocess technology or other increased cash and noncash expenses such as stock based compensation any of the foregoing factors could harm our financial condition or prevent us from achieving improvements in our financial condition and operating performance that could have otherwise been achieved by us on a standalone basis our stockholders may not have the opportunity to review vote on or evaluate future acquisitions or investments 

our ability to acquire and maintain licenses to intellectual property especially for sports titles affects our revenue and profitability competition for these licenses may make them more expensive and increase our costs 

certain of our products are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others for example our 2k sports products include rights licensed from major sports leagues and players associations similarly some of our other titles are based on licenses of popular entertainment products competition for these licenses is intense if we are unable to maintain these licenses or obtain additional licenses on reasonable economic terms or with significant commercial value our revenue and profitability could decline significantly competition for these licenses may also increase the advances guarantees and royalties that we must pay to the licensor which could significantly increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability in addition on certain intellectual property licenses we are subject to guaranteed minimum payments royalties or standards of performance and may not be able to terminate these agreements prior to their stated expiration if such licensed products do not generate revenues in excess of such minimum guarantees our profitability will be adversely affected 

we are subject to contractual covenants which place certain limitations on how we manage our business  

our credit agreement as defined herein and the indentures governing our convertible notes as defined herein limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt paying dividends repurchasing shares and acquiring or disposing of assets or businesses in addition we have granted a security interest in connection with certain compensatory arrangements which limits our ability to incur senior debt in excess of certain amounts accordingly we may be restricted from taking actions that management believes would be desirable and in the best interests of us and our stockholders our credit agreement and the indentures also require us to satisfy specified financial and nonfinancial covenants a breach of any of the covenants contained in our credit agreement could result in an event of default under the agreement and under the indentures governing our convertible notes and would allow our lenders and noteholders to pursue various remedies including accelerating the repayment of any outstanding indebtedness 

our involvement and the involvement of some of our former executive officers in a wide variety of lawsuits investigations and proceedings has had and may in the future have a material adverse effect on us 

we and some of our former officers directors and employees have been the subject of three separate governmental investigations and a substantial amount of litigation and other proceedings relating to the subject matter of those investigations while these matters have been resolved we may be subject to heightened scrutiny in the future as a result of our historical legal proceedings including an increased likelihood of a government investigation occurring and an increased likelihood that any such investigation is more extensive than in the past furthermore any future fines restrictions or other penalties imposed as a result of any such investigation may be more severe than those which may be imposed on a company without our history 

our business and products are subject to potential legislation the adoption of such proposed legislation could limit the retail market for our products 

several proposals have been made for federal legislation to regulate our industry such proposals seek to prohibit the sale of products containing content included in some of our games if any such proposals are enacted into law it may limit the potential market for some of our games in the united states and adversely affect our operating results other countries such as germany have adopted laws regulating content both in packaged games and those transmitted over the internet that are stricter than current united states laws in the united states proposals have also been made by numerous state legislators to regulate and prohibit the sale of interactive entertainment software products containing certain types of violent or sexual content to under 17 or 18 audiences such as the state of californias ultraviolent video games law that sought to ban the sale or rental of violent video games to minors while such legislation to date has been enjoined by industry and retail groups or been found unconstitutional the adoption into law of such legislation in federal andor in state jurisdictions in which we do significant business could severely limit the retail market for some of our games 

we may need additional capital if we incur losses 

if we incur losses in the future we may be required to raise additional capital in order to fund our operations we could seek to raise capital in a number of ways including through the issuance of debt or equity or through other financing arrangements in october 2011 we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement the credit agreement which amended and restated our july 2007 credit agreement as defined herein which requires us to make periodic interest or other debt service payments in addition we issued 4375 convertible notes due 2014 in june 2009 the 4375 convertible notes and 175 convertible notes due 2016 in november 2011 the 175 convertible notes and together with the 4375 convertible notes the convertible notes which require us to make periodic interest payments to the holders of the convertible notes if we borrow additional funds further debt service payments would probably be necessary in addition the terms of additional debt may 

impose significant restrictions on our ability to operate our business if we seek financing through the sale of equity or equitybased securities such as our convertible notes our current stockholders will suffer dilution in their percentage ownership of common stock we cannot be certain as to our ability to raise additional capital in the future or under what terms capital would be available if we need to raise capital and are not successful in doing so we will have to consider other options that may include but are not limited to a reduction in our expenditures for internal and external new product development reductions in overhead expenses and sales of intellectual property and other assets these actions should they become necessary will likely result in a reduction in the size of our operations and could materially affect the prospects of our business 

we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill becomes impaired 

we are required under us generally accepted accounting principles to review our goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating a requirement to reevaluate whether our goodwill continues to be recoverable include a significant decline in stock price and market capitalization slower growth rates in our industry or other materially adverse events we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill is determined this may adversely affect our operating results 

our reported financial results could be adversely affected by the application of existing or future accounting standards to our business as it evolves 

our reported financial results are affected by the accounting policies promulgated by the sec and national accounting standards bodies and the methods estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies for example standards regarding software revenue recognition have and could further significantly affect the way we account for revenue related to our products and services we expect that a significant portion of our games will be online enabled in the future and we could be required to recognize the related revenue over an extended period of time rather than at the time of sale as we enhance expand and diversify our business and product offerings the application of existing or future financial accounting standards particularly those relating to the way we account for revenue could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results although not necessarily on our cash flows 

risks relating to our common stock 

for purposes of this section —risks relating to our common stock references to the company we our and us refer only to taketwo interactive software inc and not to its subsidiaries 

additional issuances of equity securities by us would dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders 

we may issue equity or equitybased securities such as our convertible notes in the future in connection with acquisitions or strategic transactions to adjust our ratio of debt to equity including through repayment of outstanding debt to fund expansion of our operations or for other purposes to the extent we issue additional equity securities the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders would be reduced 

future sales or other issuances of our common stock could adversely affect its market price 

the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect its price the sale or the availability for sale of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause the price of our common stock to decline the issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of our convertible notes could also adversely affect the price of our common stock 

our stock price has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly 

the market price of our common stock historically has been and we expect will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us including those discussed in the risk factors in this section as well as others not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material to changes in securities analysts earnings estimates or ratings to our results or future financial guidance falling below our expectations and analysts and investors expectations to factors affecting the computer software entertainment media or electronics industries or to national or international economic conditions 

stock markets in general have experienced over the years and continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected market prices for companies such as ours and that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the affected companies these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock regardless of our operating performance 

the convertible senior note hedge and warrant transactions entered into in connection with the offering of our 4375 convertible notes may affect the value of those notes and our common stock 

in connection with the offering of our 4375 convertible notes we entered into convertible senior note hedge transactions which are expected to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the notes however we also entered into warrant transactions which could separately have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants in addition the counterparties to the hedge and warrant transactions andor their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock andor purchasing or selling our common stock in secondary market transactions at any time prior to the maturity of the 4375 convertible notes and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of the 4375 convertible notes this activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the 4375 convertible notes 

delaware law our charter documents and provisions of our debt agreements may impede or discourage a takeover which could cause the market price of our shares to decline 

we are a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a thirdparty to acquire control of us even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders our board has the power without stockholder approval to adopt a stockholder rights plan andor to designate the terms of one or more series of preferred stock and issue shares of preferred stock in addition we may under certain circumstances involving a change of control be obligated to repurchase all or a portion of our convertible notes and any potential acquirer would be required to assume our obligations related to any outstanding convertible notes we or any possible acquirer may not have available financial resources necessary to repurchase those notes the ability of our board to create and issue a new series of preferred stock and certain provisions of delaware law our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the indenture governing our notes could impede a merger takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock which under certain circumstances could reduce the market price of our common stock and the value of any outstanding notes 

our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future years taxes could be substantially limited if we experience an ownership change as defined in the internal revenue code 

section 382 of the internal revenue code contains rules that limit the ability of a company to use its net operating loss carryforwards in years after an ownership change which is generally defined as any change in ownership of more than 50 of its stock over a threeyear testing period these rules generally operate 

by focusing on ownership changes among stockholders owning directly or indirectly 5 or more of the stock of a company andor any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of stock by the company if as a result of future transactions involving our common stock including purchases or sales of stock by 5 stockholders we undergo cumulative ownership changes which exceed 50 over the testing period our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards would be subject to additional limitations under section 382 

generally if an ownership change occurs the annual taxable income limitation on the use of net operating loss carryforwards is equal to the product of the applicable longterm tax exempt rate and the value of the companys stock immediately before the ownership change depending on the resulting limitation a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards could expire before we would be able to use them 

our inability to fully utilize our net operating losses to offset taxable income generated in the future could have a material and negative affect on our future financial position and results of operations

software titles published by our rockstar games label are primarily internally developed we expect rockstar games our whollyowned publisher of the grand theft auto  max payne  midnight club  red dead and other popular franchises to continue to be a leader in the action  adventure product category and create groundbreaking entertainment by leveraging our existing titles as well as developing new brands we believe that rockstar has established a uniquely original popular cultural phenomenon with its grand theft auto series which is the interactive entertainment industrys most iconic and critically acclaimed brand and has soldin approximately 120 million units rockstar continues to expand on our established franchises by releasing sequels as well as offering downloadable episodes and content in may 2011 rockstar released the commercially successful and critically acclaimed la noire  which became the first video game ever chosen as an official selection of the tribeca film festival rockstar has released several downloadable content packs to support that title rockstar is also well known for developing brands in other genres including the bully and manhunt franchises

we also have expansion initiatives in the rapidly growing asia markets where our strategy is to broaden the distribution of our existing products expand our business in japan and establish an online gaming presence especially in china and korea 2k sports has secured a multiyear license from the nba to develop an online version of the nba simulation game in china taiwan south korea and southeast asia 

discontinued operations 

in february 2010 we completed the sale to synnex corporation synnex of our jack of all games thirdparty distribution business which primarily distributed thirdparty interactive entertainment software hardware and accessories in north america for approximately 440 million including 373 million in cash subject to purchase price adjustments and up to an additional 67 million subject to the achievement of certain items which were not met in april 2011 we settled on the purchase price adjustments and as a result the purchase price was lowered by 15 million consequently the net purchase price after the settlement was 358 million the financial results of this business which were previously reported as our distribution business have been classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented the assets and liabilities of this business are reflected as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations 

trends and factors affecting our business 

product release schedule our financial results are affected by the timing of our product releases and the commercial success of those titles our grand theft auto products in particular have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue sales of grand theft auto products generated approximately 138 of the companys net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 the timing of our grand theft auto releases varies significantly which in turn may affect our financial performance on a quarterly and annual basis 

economic environment and retailer performance we continue to monitor economic conditions that may unfavorably affect our businesses such as deteriorating consumer demand pricing pressure on our products credit quality of our receivables and foreign currency exchange rates our business is dependent upon a limited number of customers who account for a significant portion of our revenue our five largest customers accounted for 439 438 598 557 and 564 of net revenue during the fiscal years ended march 31 2012 2011 and 2010 five months ended march 31 2010 and fiscal year ended october 31 2009 respectively as of march 31 2012 and 2011 the five largest customers accounted for 613 and 542 of our gross accounts receivable respectively customers that individually accounted for 

more than 10 of our gross accounts receivable balance comprised 406 and 382 of such balances at march 31 2012 and 2011 respectively the economic environment has affected our customers in the past and may do so in the future bankruptcies or consolidations of our large retail customers could seriously hurt our business due to uncollectible accounts receivables and the concentration of purchasing power among the remaining large retailers certain of our large customers sell used copies of our games which may negatively affect our business by reducing demand for new copies of our games while the downloadable episodes that we now offer for certain of our titles may serve to reduce used game sales we expect used game sales to continue to affect our business 

hardware platforms the majority of our products are made for the hardware platforms developed by three companies—sony microsoft and nintendo note 16 to our consolidated financial statements segment and geographic information discloses that sony microsoft and nintendo hardware platforms comprised approximately 894 of the companys net revenue by product platform for the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 the success of our business is dependent upon the consumer acceptance of these platforms and the continued growth in the installed base of these platforms when new hardware platforms are introduced demand for software based on older platforms declines which may negatively affect our business additionally our development costs are generally higher for titles based on new platforms and we have limited ability to predict the consumer acceptance of the new platforms which may affect our sales and profitability as a result we believe it is important to focus our development efforts on a select number of titles which is consistent with our strategy 

online content and digital distribution the interactive entertainment software industry is delivering a growing amount of content through digital online delivery methods we provide a variety of online delivered products and services a number of our titles that are available through retailers as packaged goods products are also available through direct digital download through the internet from websites we own and others owned by thirdparties we also offer downloadable addon content to our packaged goods titles in addition in july 2011 we launched our first social gaming experience sid meiers civilization world  for facebook and we have several initiatives underway to develop online games primarily for asian markets we expect online delivery of games and game services to become an increasing part of our business over the longterm 

product releases 

we released the following key titles in fiscal year 2012 



product pipeline 

we have announced expected release dates for the following key titles this list does not represent all titles currently in development 



fiscal 2012 financial summary 

our fiscal year ended march 31 2012 net revenue was led by titles from a variety of our top franchises including la noire  nba 2k12  grand theft auto products duke nukem forever and red dead redemption  our net revenue decreased to 8258 million a decrease of 3111 million or 274 from the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 

for the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 our net loss was 1088 million as compared to net income of 485 million in the prior year net loss per share for the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 was 131 as compared to earnings per share for the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 of 056 our net loss for the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 as compared to our net income for the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 was primarily as a result of 1 a decrease of 3111 million in net revenue 2 a decrease of 3 points in our gross profit as a percent of net revenue 3 an increase of 14 points in our operating expenses as a percent of net revenue 4 an increase of 61 million in interest and other net expense and 5 a decrease of 42 million in our loss from discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 

at march 31 2012 we had 4203 million of cash and cash equivalents compared to 2804 million at march 31 2011 our increase in cash and cash equivalents from march 31 2011 was primarily a result of cash provided by financing activities partially offset by cash used in operating activities cash used in investing activities and the effect of exchange rates 

cash provided by financing activities was generated from the net proceeds from the issuance of 2500 million of 175 convertible notes in november 2011 cash used in operating activities was primarily due to our net loss of 1088 million cash used in investing activities was primarily due to purchases of fixed assets of 108 million and we paid contingent consideration of 41 million for our prior year acquisitions cash and cash equivalents were negatively affected by 43 million as a result of foreign currency exchange rate movements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we base our estimates assumptions and judgments on historical 

experience current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared on a regular basis management reviews the accounting policies assumptions estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are fairly presented in accordance with us gaap however because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 

we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our financial results and they require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the affect and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue upon the transfer of title and risk of loss to our customers accordingly we recognize revenue for software titles when there is 1 persuasive evidence that an arrangement with the customer exists which is generally based on a customer purchase order 2 the product is delivered 3 the selling price is fixed or determinable and 4 collection of the customer receivable is deemed probable certain products are sold to customers with a street date  ie the earliest date these products may be sold by retailers for these products we recognize revenue on the later of the street date or the sale date 

our payment arrangements with customers typically provide net 30 and 60 day terms advances received for licensing and exclusivity arrangements are reported on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred revenue until we meet our performance obligations at which point we recognize the revenue 

some of our software products provide limited online functionality at no additional cost to the consumer generally we consider such features to be incidental to the overall product offering and an inconsequential deliverable accordingly we do not defer revenue related to products containing such online features we determine whether our products contain substantial online functionality by evaluating the significance of the development effort and the nature of the online features the extent of anticipated marketing focus on the online features the significance of the online features to the customers anticipated overall gameplay experience and the significance of our post sale obligations to customers overall online play functionality is still an emerging area for us and we continue to monitor this developing functionality and its significance to our products 

in addition some of our software products are sold exclusively as downloads of digital content for which the consumer takes possession of the digital content for a fee revenue from product downloads is generally recognized when the download is made available assuming all other recognition criteria are met 

certain of our software products include ingame advertising for thirdparty products advance payments received for ingame advertising are reported on the balance sheet as deferred revenue until we meet our performance obligations at which point we recognize the revenue which is generally at the time of the initial release of the product 

revenue is recognized after deducting estimated reserves for returns price concessions and other allowances in circumstances when we do not have a reliable basis to estimate returns and price concessions or are unable to determine that collection of a receivable is probable we defer the revenue 

until such time as we can reliably estimate any related returns and allowances and determine that collection of the receivable is probable 

allowances for returns price concessions and other allowances 

we accept returns and grant price concessions in connection with our publishing arrangements following reductions in the price of our products we grant price concessions to permit customers to take credits against amounts they owe us with respect to merchandise unsold by them our customers must satisfy certain conditions to entitle them to return products or receive price concessions including compliance with applicable payment terms and confirmation of field inventory levels 

our distribution arrangements with customers generally do not give them the right to return titles or to cancel firm orders however we occasionally accept returns from our customers for stock balancing and make accommodations to customers which include credits and returns when demand for specific titles falls below expectations 

we make estimates of future product returns and price concessions related to current period product revenue we estimate the amount of future returns and price concessions for published titles based upon among other factors historical experience and performance of the titles in similar genres historical performance of the hardware platform customer inventory levels analysis of sellthrough rates sales force and retail customer feedback industry pricing market conditions and changes in demand and acceptance of our products by consumers 

significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for returns and price concessions in any accounting period we believe we can make reliable estimates of returns and price concessions however actual results may differ from initial estimates as a result of changes in circumstances market conditions and assumptions adjustments to estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 

software development costs and licenses 

capitalized software development costs include direct costs incurred for internally developed titles and payments made to thirdparty software developers under development agreements 

we capitalize internal software development costs including stockbased compensation specifically identifiable employee payroll expense and incentive compensation costs related to the completion and release of titles thirdparty production and other content costs subsequent to establishing technological feasibility of a software title technological feasibility of a product includes the completion of both technical design documentation and game design documentation significant management judgment and estimates are utilized in establishing technological feasibility 

we enter into agreements with thirdparty developers that require us to make payments for game development and production services in exchange for these payments we receive the exclusive publishing and distribution rights to the finished game title as well as in some cases the underlying intellectual property rights such agreements allow us to fully recover these payments to the developers at an agreed upon royalty rate earned on the subsequent retail sales of such software net of any agreed upon costs prior to establishing technological feasibility of a product we record any costs incurred by thirdparty developers as research and development expenses subsequent to establishing technological feasibility of a product we capitalize all development and production service payments to thirdparty developers as software development costs and licenses we typically enter into agreements with thirdparty developers after completing the technical design documentation for our products and therefore record the design costs leading up to a signed development contract as research and development expense when we contract with thirdparty developers we generally select thirdparty developers that have proven technology and experience in the genre of the software being developed which often allows for the 

establishment of technological feasibility early in the development cycle in instances where the documentation of the design and technology are not in place prior to an executed contract we monitor the software development process and require our thirdparty developers to adhere to the same technological feasibility standards that apply to our internally developed products 

licenses consist of payments and guarantees made to holders of intellectual property rights for use of their trademarks copyrights or other intellectual property rights in the development of our products agreements with license holders generally provide for guaranteed minimum royalty payments for use of their intellectual property guaranteed minimum payments are initially recorded as an asset licenses and as a liability accrued licenses upon execution of a licensing agreement provided that no significant performance remains to be completed by the licensor when significant performance remains to be completed by the licensor we record payments when actually paid 

certain licenses especially those related to our sports products extend over multiyear periods and encompass multiple game titles in addition to guaranteed minimum payments these licenses frequently contain provisions that could require us to pay royalties to the license holder based on preagreed unit sales thresholds 

amortization of capitalized software development costs and licenses commences when a product is released and is recorded on a titlebytitle basis in cost of goods sold for capitalized software development costs amortization is calculated using 1 the proportion of current year revenues to the total revenues expected to be recorded over the life of the title or 2 the straightline method over the remaining estimated useful life of the title whichever is greater for capitalized licenses amortization is calculated as a ratio of 1 current period revenues to the total revenues expected to be recorded over the remaining life of the title or 2 the contractual royalty rate based on actual net product sales as defined in the licensing agreement whichever is greater 

significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of the recoverability of capitalized software costs at each balance sheet date or earlier if an indicator of impairment exists we evaluate the recoverability of capitalized software costs licenses and any other unrecognized minimum commitments that have not been paid using an undiscounted future cash flow analysis we use various measures to evaluate expected product performance and estimate future revenues for our software titles including historical performance of comparable titles orders for titles prior to release and the estimated performance of a sequel title based on the performance of the title on which the sequel is based when management determines that the value of a title is unlikely to be recovered by product sales capitalized costs are charged to cost of goods sold in the period in which such determination is made 

we have established profit and unit sales based internal royalty programs that provide for certain of our employees to participate in the success of software titles that they assist in developing royalties earned by employees under this program are recorded as cost of goods sold as they are incurred

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap often requires us to determine the fair value of a particular item to fairly present our consolidated financial statements without an independent market or another representative transaction determining the fair value of a particular item requires us to make several assumptions that are inherently difficult to predict and can have a material influence on the conclusion of the appropriate accounting 

there are various valuation techniques used to estimate fair value these include 1 the market approach where market transactions for identical or comparable assets or liabilities are used to determine the fair value 2 the income approach which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts for example future cash flows or future earnings to a single present amount and 3 the cost approach which is based on the amount that would be required to replace an asset for many of our fair value estimates including 

our estimates of the fair value of acquired intangible assets we use the income approach using the income approach requires the use of financial models which require us to make various estimates including but not limited to 1 the potential future cash flows for the asset liability or equity instrument being measured 2 the timing of receipt or payment of those future cash flows 3 the time value of money associated with the delayed receipt or payment of such cash flows and 4 the inherent risk associated with the cash flows risk premium making these cash flow estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and if any of the estimates used to determine the fair value using the income approach turns out to be inaccurate our financial results may be negatively affected furthermore relatively small changes in many of these estimates can have a significant influence on the estimated fair value resulting from the financial models or the related accounting conclusion reached for example a relatively small change in the estimated fair value of an asset may change a conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired while we are required to make certain fair value assessments associated with the accounting for several types of transactions the following areas are the most sensitive to the assessments 

inventory obsolescence we regularly review inventory quantities onhand and in the retail channels and record an inventory provision for excess or obsolete inventory based on the future expected demand for our products significant changes in demand for our products would affect managements estimates in establishing our inventory provision we write down inventory based on excess or obsolete inventories determined primarily by future anticipated demand for our products inventory writedowns are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market value based upon assumptions about future demand that are inherently difficult to assess 

business combinations—goodwill and intangible assets we must estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these can have a material effect on our reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various lives furthermore a change in the estimated fair value of an asset or liability often has a direct influence on the amount to recognize as goodwill which is an asset that is not amortized often determining the fair value of these assets and liabilities assumed requires an assessment of expected use of the asset the expected cost to extinguish the liability or our expectations related to the timing and the successful completion of development of an acquired inprocess technology such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material influence on our financial statements 

we use either the income cost or market approach to aid in our conclusions of such fair values and asset lives the income approach presumes that the value of an asset can be estimated by the net economic benefit to be received over the life of the asset discounted to present value the cost approach presumes that an investor would pay no more for an asset than its replacement or reproduction cost the market approach estimates value based on what other participants in the market have paid for reasonably similar assets although each valuation approach is considered in valuing the assets acquired the approach ultimately selected is based on the characteristics of the asset and the availability of information 

we evaluate our goodwill annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount the determination of whether or not goodwill has become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units changes in our strategy andor market conditions could significantly affect these judgments and require reductions to recorded intangible asset balances 

longlived assets we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions including determining which cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset the useful life over which cash flows will occur their amount and the assets residual value if any in turn measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value which is based on the best information available we use internal 

discounted cash flow estimates quoted market prices when available and independent appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value we derive the required cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans and apply an appropriate discount rate 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment in estimating expected stock volatility and the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 

we have granted stock options to nonemployees which were subject to variable accounting when variable accounting is applied to stock option grants we remeasured the fair value of the unvested options at the end of each reporting period or until the options are cancelled or expire unexercised compensation expense in any given period was calculated as the difference between total earned compensation at the end of the period less total earned compensation at the beginning of the period both of which was based on the price of our common stock at such dates as a result fluctuations in the price of our common stock changed compensation expense recognized by us from period to period 

we have also granted time and marketbased restricted stock awards to employees and nonemployees timebased and marketbased awards to nonemployees are subject to variable accounting for the timebased restricted stock grants to nonemployees we cumulatively remeasure the fair value at the end of every period based on the month end closing price of our common stock marketbased restricted stock awards vest based on the relative performance of our common stock to a composite index we calculate the fair value of marketbased restricted stock using a monte carlo simulation method which requires a substantial number of inputs and estimates of future market conditions and considers the range of various vesting probabilities as a result expense recorded for our nonemployee awards can fluctuate substantially from period to period 

income taxes 

we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred income taxes are recognized for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at currently enacted statutory tax rates for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized our cumulative pretax loss in recent fiscal years represents sufficient evidence for us to determine that the establishment of a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset is appropriate this valuation allowance offsets deferred tax assets associated with future tax deductions as well as carryforward items 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in addition our filed tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 

we recognize and measure uncertain tax positions and record tax benefits when it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical 

merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

at each period end it is necessary for us to make certain estimates and assumptions to compute the provision for income taxes including allocations of certain transactions to different tax jurisdictions amounts of permanent and temporary differences the likelihood of deferred tax assets being recovered and the outcome of contingent tax risks these estimates and assumptions are revised as new events occur more experience is acquired and additional information is obtained the effect of these revisions is recorded in income tax expense or benefit in the period in which they become known 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

multipledeliverable revenue arrangements 

on april 1 2011 the company adopted new guidance related to the accounting for multipledeliverable revenue arrangements these new rules amend the existing guidance for separating consideration in multipledeliverable arrangements and establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable the adoption of this new guidance did not have any effect on our consolidated financial position cash flows or results of operations 

certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 

on april 1 2011 the company adopted new guidance that changes the accounting model for revenue arrangements by excluding tangible products containing both software and nonsoftware components that function together to deliver the products essential functionality the adoption of this new guidance did not have any effect on our consolidated financial position cash flows or results of operations 

testing goodwill for impairment 

on september 30 2011 the company adopted new guidance related to testing goodwill for impairment effective for the companys annual impairment test as of august 1 2011 this new guidance permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting units fair value is less than its carrying value as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test if it is determined through the qualitative assessment that a reporting units fair value is more likely than not greater than its carrying value the remaining impairment steps would be unnecessary the qualitative assessment is optional allowing entities to go directly to the quantitative assessment this new guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 however early adoption is permitted including for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed as of a date before september 15 2011 if an entitys financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued the early adoption of this new guidance did not have any effect on our consolidated financial position cash flows or results of operations 

comprehensive income 

in june 2011 new guidance was issued related to the presentation of comprehensive income the main provisions of the new guidance provide that an entity that reports items of other comprehensive income has the option to present comprehensive income as i a single statement that presents the components of net income and total net income the components of other comprehensive income and total other comprehensive income and a total for comprehensive income or ii in two separate but consecutive statements whereby an entity must present the components of net income and total net income in the first statement and that statement is immediately followed by a financial statement that presents the components of other comprehensive income a total for other comprehensive income and a total for 

comprehensive income the new rules eliminate the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of stockholders equity these new rules are to be applied retrospectively and become effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning on or after december 15 2011 april 1 2012 for the company with early adoption permitted we do not expect the adoption of this new guidance to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position cash flows or results of operations 

fluctuations in operating results and seasonality 

we have experienced fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results as a result of the timing of the introduction of new titles variations in sales of titles developed for particular platforms market acceptance of our titles development and promotional expenses relating to the introduction of new titles sequels or enhancements of existing titles projected and actual changes in platforms the timing and success of title introductions by our competitors product returns changes in pricing policies by us and our competitors the size and timing of acquisitions the timing of orders from major customers order cancellations and delays in product shipment sales of our products are also seasonal with peak shipments typically occurring in the fourth calendar quarter as a result of increased demand for titles during the holiday season quarterly and annual comparisons of operating results are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 

results of operations

financial condition 

we are subject to credit risks particularly if any of our receivables represent a limited number of customers or are concentrated in foreign markets if we are unable to collect our accounts receivable as they become due it could adversely affect our liquidity and working capital position 

generally we have been able to collect our accounts receivable in the ordinary course of business we do not hold any collateral to secure payment from customers we have trade credit insurance on the majority of our customers to mitigate accounts receivable risk 

a majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to major retailers and distributors our five largest customers accounted for 439 438 and 598 of net revenue during the fiscal years ended march 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively as of march 31 2012 and 2011 our five largest customers accounted for 613 and 542 of our gross accounts receivable respectively customers that individually accounted for more than 10 of our gross accounts receivable balance comprised 406 and 382 of such balances at march 31 2012 and 2011 respectively we believe that the receivable balances from these largest customers do not represent a significant credit risk based on past collection experience although we actively monitor each customers credit worthiness and economic conditions that may affect our customers 

business and access to capital we are monitoring the current global economic conditions including credit markets and other factors as it relates to our customers in order to manage the risk of uncollectible accounts receivable 

we believe our current cash and cash equivalents and projected cash flow from operations along with availability under our credit agreement will provide us with sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash requirements for working capital capital expenditures and commitments through at least the next 12 months 

as of march 31 2012 the amount of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the us by our foreign subsidiaries was approximately 1245 million these balances are dispersed across various locations around the world we believe that such dispersion meets the business and liquidity needs of our foreign affiliates in addition the company expects in the foreseeable future to have the ability to generate sufficient cash domestically to support ongoing operations consequently it is the companys intention to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries in the event the company needed to repatriate funds outside of the us such repatriation may be subject to local laws and tax consequences including foreign withholding taxes or us income taxes it is not practicable to estimate the tax liability and the company would try to minimize the tax effect to the extent possible however any repatriation may not result in actual cash payments as the taxable event would likely be offset by the utilization of the then available net operating losses and tax credits 

our changes in cash flows were as follows 



at march 31 2012 we had 4203 million of cash and cash equivalents compared to 2804 million at march 31 2011 our increase in cash and cash equivalents from march 31 2011 was primarily a result of cash provided by financing activities partially offset by cash used in operating activities cash used in investing activities and the effect of foreign currency exchange rates 

cash provided by financing activities was generated from the net proceeds from the issuance of 2500 million of 175 convertible notes in november 2011 cash used in operating activities was primarily due to our net loss of 1088 million cash used in investing activities was primarily due to purchases of fixed assets of 108 million and the payment of contingent consideration of 41 million for our prior year acquisitions cash and cash equivalents were negatively affected by 43 million as a result of foreign currency exchange rate movements 

contractual obligations and commitments 

we have entered into various agreements in the ordinary course of business that require substantial cash commitments over the next several years generally these include 

• agreements to acquire licenses to intellectual property such as trademarks copyrights and technology for use in the publishing marketing and distribution of our software titles in addition we have certain minimum marketing support commitments where we commit to spend specified amounts related to marketing our products our licensing and marketing commitments primarily 47 

reflect agreements with major sports leagues and players associations and expire at various times through september 2018 

• contractual payments to thirdparty software developers that expire at various times through july 2014 guaranteed minimum payments assume satisfactory performance • operating leases primarily related to occupancy furniture and equipment expiring at various times through march 2023 included in the cash commitments for operating leases below is a liability for a lease assumption without economic benefit which was approximately 37 million at march 31 2012 and is recorded in liabilities of discontinued operations on the consolidated balance sheet see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations and • purchase obligations primarily related to agreements to purchase services that are enforceable and legally binding on the company that specifies all significant terms including fixed minimum or variable pricing provisions and the approximate timing of the transactions expiring at various times through october 2015 a summary of annual minimum contractual obligations and commitments as of march 31 2012 is as follows in thousands of dollars 



in addition to the cash commitments above we have also entered into acquisition agreements that contain provisions for us to pay contingent cash consideration typically contingent on the acquired company achieving certain financial unit sales or performance conditions the amount and timing of these payments are currently not fixed or determinable see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our potential acquisition commitments 

income taxes at march 31 2012 the company had recorded a liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits of 156 million for which we are unable to make a reasonable and reliable estimate of the period in which these liabilities will be settled with the respective tax authorities therefore these liabilities have not been included in the contractual obligations table 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of march 31 2012 and 2011 we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial parties such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes as such we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements and are not exposed to any financing liquidity market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 

international operations 

net revenue earned outside of the united states is principally generated by our operations in europe asia australia canada and latin america for the fiscal years ended march 31 2012 2011 and 2010 approximately 456 455 and 404 respectively of our net revenue was earned outside the united states we are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade including increased credit risks tariffs and duties fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates shipping delays and international political regulatory and economic developments all of which can have a significant effect on our operating results 

fluctuations in quarterly operating results and seasonality 

we have experienced fluctuations in quarterly operating results as a result of the timing of the introduction of new titles variations in sales of titles developed for particular platforms market acceptance of our titles development and promotional expenses relating to the introduction of new titles sequels or enhancements of existing titles projected and actual changes in platforms the timing and success of title introductions by our competitors product returns changes in pricing policies by us and our competitors the accuracy of retailers forecasts of consumer demand the size and timing of acquisitions the timing of orders from major customers and order cancellations and delays in product shipment sales of our titles are also seasonal with peak shipments typically occurring in the fourth calendar quarter as a result of increased demand for titles during the holiday season quarterly comparisons of operating results are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential loss arising from fluctuations in market rates and prices our market risk exposures primarily include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

historically fluctuations in interest rates have not had a significant effect on our operating results under our credit agreement outstanding balances bear interest at our election of a 150 to 200 above a certain base rate 475 at march 31 2012 or b 250 to 300 above the libor rate approximately 274 at march 31 2012 with the margin rate subject to the achievement of certain average liquidity levels changes in market rates may affect our future interest expense if there is an outstanding balance on our line of credit the 175 convertible notes and the 4375 convertible notes pay interest semiannually at a fixed rate of 175 and 4375 respectively per annum and we expect that there will be no fluctuation related to the convertible notes affecting our cash component of interest expense for additional details on our convertible notes see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we transact business in foreign currencies and are exposed to risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates accounts relating to foreign operations are translated into united states dollars using prevailing exchange rates at the relevant period end translation adjustments are included as a separate component of stockholders equity for the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 our foreign currency translation loss adjustment was approximately 38 million we recognized a foreign currency exchange transaction loss for the fiscal years ended march 31 2012 and 2010 of 13 million and 06 million respectively and a foreign currency exchange transaction gain in interest and other net in our consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 of 14 million 

cash flow hedging activities 

during the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with forecasted nonfunctional currency denominated expenses these transactions which are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts is reported as either assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets the effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these hedges is initially reported net of tax as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity the gross amount of the effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these hedges is subsequently reclassified into cost of goods sold or research and development expenses as appropriate in the period when the forecasted transaction is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations in the event that the gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income loss are deemed to be ineffective the ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value if any is reclassified to interest and other net in our consolidated statements of operations in the event that the underlying forecasted transactions do not occur or it becomes probable that they will not occur within the defined hedge period the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income loss to interest and other net in our consolidated statements of operations during the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 all forecasted transactions occurred and therefore there were no such gains or losses reclassified into interest and other net we do not enter into derivative financial contracts for speculative or trading purposes as of march 31 2012 we had 102 million of forward contracts outstanding to buy foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars all of which have maturities of less than one year as of march 31 2012 the fair value of these outstanding forward contracts was immaterial and is included in prepaid expenses and other 

balance sheet hedging activities 

we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with nonfunctional currency denominated cash balances and intercompany funding loans nonfunctional currency denominated accounts receivable and nonfunctional currency denominated accounts payable these transactions are not designated as hedging instruments and are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts is reported as either assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value are reported in interest and other net in our consolidated statements of operations we do not enter into derivative financial contracts for speculative or trading purposes at march 31 2012 we had 40 million of forward contracts outstanding to buy foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars and 283 million of forward contracts outstanding to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars all of which have maturities of less than one year at march 31 2011 we had 24 million of forward contracts outstanding to buy foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars and 355 million of forward contracts outstanding to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars all of which have maturities of less than one year for the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 we recorded a gain of 07 million and for the fiscal years ended march 31 2011 and 2010 we recorded losses of 69 million and 10 million respectively related to foreign currency forward contracts in interest and other net on the consolidated statements of operations as of march 31 2012 and 2011 the fair value of these outstanding forward contracts was immaterial and is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities 

our hedging programs are designed to reduce but do not entirely eliminate the effect of currency exchange rate movements we believe the counterparties to these foreign currency forward contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks and that the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risks there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations for the fiscal year ended march 31 2012 456 of the companys revenue was generated outside the united states using sensitivity analysis a hypothetical 10 increase in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would decrease revenues by 46 while a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would increase revenues by 46 in the opinion of management a substantial portion of this fluctuation would be offset by cost of goods sold and operating expenses incurred in local currency

strategy 

overview we endeavor to be the most creative innovative and efficient company in our industry our strategy is to capitalize on the widespread popularity of interactive entertainment by focusing on publishing a select number of high quality titles for which we can create sequels and build successful franchises we develop most of our frontline products internally and own the intellectual property associated with most of our titles which we believe best positions us financially and competitively we have established a portfolio of proprietary software content for the major hardware platforms in a wide range of genres including action adventure racing roleplaying sports and strategy we believe that our commitment to creativity and innovation is a distinguishing strength allowing us to differentiate many of our products in the marketplace by combining advanced technology with compelling storylines and characters that provide unique gameplay experiences for consumers we have created acquired or licensed a group of highly recognizable brands to match the variety of consumer demographics we aspire to serve ranging from adults to children and game enthusiasts to casual gamers 

support label structure to target distinct market segments our business consists of our whollyowned labels rockstar games and 2k which publishes its titles under 2k games 2k sports and 2k play each group focuses on distinct product genres and target demographics we expect rockstar games our whollyowned 

publisher of the grand theft auto  midnight club  red dead and other popular franchises to continue to be a leader in the action product category and create groundbreaking entertainment by leveraging our existing titles as well as developing new brands we expect 2k games developer and publisher of our successful sid meiers civilization series our critically acclaimed bioshock franchise and other popular titles to continue to develop new and successful franchises in the future our 2k sports series which includes major league baseball 2k  nba 2k  nhl 2k and top spin are generally published on an annual basis 2k play focuses on the market of casual and familyoriented games such as carnival games  an internally developed and owned franchise 2k play has leveraged this franchise through sequels and brand extensions including carnival games™ minigolf and carnival games™ monkey see monkey do  we also have expansion initiatives in the rapidly growing asiapacific markets where our strategy is to broaden the distribution of our existing products expand our business in japan and establish an online gaming presence especially in china and korea 

focus on core strength of producing select high quality titles our primary strategy is to publish a select number of high quality titles based on internallyowned and developed intellectual property which typically provide higher margins than licensed products we currently own the intellectual property rights of 19 proprietary brands in addition we will selectively develop titles based on licensed properties including sports and also publish externally developed titles 

we use a product investment review process to evaluate potential titles for investment to review existing titles in development and to assess titles after release to measure their performance in the market and the return on our investment we apply this process to all of our products whether internally or externally developed the product investment review process includes reviews of each project at various stages of development by our executive management team and senior management of our publishing labels and includes coordination between our sales and marketing personnel before the launch of the titles this disciplined approach to product investment is expected to enhance the competitiveness and profitability of our titles 

we develop our products using a combination of our internal and external development resources acting under contract with us we typically select our external developers based on their track record and expertise in developing products in the same category or genre one developer will generally produce the same game for multiple platforms and will also produce sequels to an original game we believe that selecting and using development resources in this manner allows us to leverage the particular expertise of our internal and external development resources which we believe increases the quality of our products 

leverage emerging technologies and platforms including digitally delivered content we believe the diversification of our product mix will reduce our operating risks and increase our revenue we continually seek to capitalize on the technological advances in our industry that are generating new revenue streams we see opportunities in a variety of areas including downloadable content microtransactions and social games we are beginning to develop gaming experiences that capitalize on the increasing consumer adoption of social networks we also continue to pursue opportunities that exist for networked gameplay particularly for our whollyowned franchises as well as microtransactions where gamers can pay to download additional content to enhance their game playing experience 

expand international business the global market for interactive entertainment continues to grow and we seek to increase our presence internationally particularly in asia eastern europe and latin america we have expansion initiatives in the asian markets where our strategy is to broaden the distribution of our existing products expand our business in japan and establish an online gaming presence especially in china and korea we are a direct publisher in japan and korea historically we distributed our products in asia through license agreements with local publishers in japan and korea and distribution agreements with local distributors of finished goods elsewhere in asia while we retain title to all intellectual property under license agreements local publishers are responsible for localization of software content distribution and marketing of the products in their respective local markets we intend to continue to build upon our 

licensing relationships and also expand finished goods distribution strategies to grow our international business 

our publishing and software development businesses 

revenue in our publishing business is primarily derived from the sale of internally developed software titles and software titles developed by thirdparties for our benefit operating margins in our publishing business are dependent in part upon our ability to continually release new commercially successful products and to manage software product development costs we have internal development studios located in australia canada china czech republic the united kingdom and the united states as of march 31 2011 we had a research and development staff of 1560 employees with the technical capabilities to develop software titles for all major current and prior generation consoles handheld hardware platforms and pcs in multiple languages and territories 

operating margins associated with our externally developed titles or titles for which we do not own the intellectual property are generally lower because they require us to acquire licenses provide minimum development guarantees and pay thirdparty royalties agreements with thirdparty developers generally give us exclusive publishing and marketing rights and require us to make development payments pay royalties based on product sales and satisfy other conditions development payments for software titles are typically recoupable against royalties otherwise due to developers based on software sales our agreements with thirdparty developers generally provide us with the right to monitor development efforts and to cease making development payments if specified development milestones are not satisfied we also regularly monitor the level of development payments in light of expected sales for the related titles 

the development cycle for our titles generally ranges from 12 to more than 24 months and our topselling titles could take up to 3 years or longer to develop although we often simultaneously develop our software for multiple platforms in certain cases it can take 9 to 12 months to adapt a product for additional hardware platforms after initial development for one platform is completed the cost to develop a frontline software title generally ranges from 10 million to 60 million with our top titles exceeding these amounts we expect that development costs and time will continue to increase for current generation platforms 

we continue to explore new revenue streams as they evolve including higher margin sources such as downloadable content we expect downloadable content to become more prevalent as broadband connectivity continues to gain popularity and digital delivery platforms such as xbox live and psn gain additional customers we also have expansion initiatives in the asiapacific markets where our strategy is to broaden the distribution of our existing products expand our business in japan and establish an online gaming presence especially in china and korea 

rockstar games software titles published by our rockstar games label are primarily internally developed we expect rockstar games our whollyowned publisher of the grand theft auto  midnight club  red dead and other popular franchises to continue to be a leader in the action product category and create groundbreaking entertainment by leveraging our existing franchises as well as developing new brands we believe that rockstar has established a uniquely original popular cultural phenomenon with its grand theft auto series and continues to expand on our established franchises by releasing sequels as well as offering downloadable episodes and content rockstar is also well known for developing brands in other genres including the bully  manhunt and max payne franchises 

2k our 2k label publishes its titles under 2k games 2k sports and 2k play

we are dependent on a limited number of customers that account for a significant portion of our sales sales to our five largest customers during the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 accounted for approximately 438 of our net revenue with gamestop and walmart accounting for 192 and 108 respectively no other customer accounted for more than 100 of our net revenue during the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 

we also digitally distribute our titles downloadable content and micro transactions direct to consoles pcs and communications devices we view digital distribution as an important growth opportunity for our industry and company however we continue to expect that packaged goods and traditional retailers will be the primary channel for the sale of our products for the foreseeable future 

marketing 

our marketing and promotional efforts are intended to maximize exposure and broaden distribution of our titles promote brand name recognition assist retailers and properly position package and merchandise our titles 

we market titles by 

• implementing public relations campaigns using print and online advertising television radio spots and outdoor advertising we believe that we label and market our products in accordance with the applicable principles and guidelines of the entertainment software rating board or the esrb an independent selfregulatory body that assigns ratings and enforces advertising guidelines for the interactive software industry • satisfying certain shelf life and sales requirements under our agreements with hardware manufacturers in order to qualify for sonys greatest hits programs and microsofts platinum hits program in connection with these programs we receive manufacturing discounts from sony and microsoft similarly nintendo has also established a players choice program for the wii • stimulating continued sales by reducing the wholesale prices of our products to retailers at various times during the life of a product price concessions may occur at any time in a products life cycle but typically occur three to nine months after a products initial launch during the fiscal years ended march 31 2011 and 2010 and fiscal years ended october 31 2009 and 2008 price concessions to retailers amounted to 599 million 611 million 494 million and 419 million respectively in certain international markets we also provide volume rebates to stimulate continued product sales we also employ various other marketing methods designed to promote consumer awareness including instore promotions and pointofpurchase displays direct mail cooperative advertising as well as attendance at trade shows as of march 31 2011 we had a sales and marketing staff of 258 people 

product procurement 

we procure products from suppliers principally using standard purchase orders based on our assessment of market demand as well as preorders from retailers we carry inventory quantities that we believe are 

necessary to provide rapid response to retailer orders we utilize electronic data interchange with many of our customers to enhance the efficiency of placing and shipping orders and receiving payments 

competition 

in our publishing business we compete with 

• companies that range in size and cost structure from very small with limited resources to very large companies with greater financial marketing and technical personnel and other resources than ours including activision blizzard electronic arts and thq and international companies such as capcom konami namcobandai sega square enix and ubisoft • sony microsoft and nintendo for licenses to properties and the sale of interactive entertainment software each of which is a large developer and marketer of software for its own platforms each of these competitors has the financial resources to withstand significant price competition and to implement extensive advertising campaigns • other software hardware entertainment and media for limited retail shelf space and promotional resources the competition is intense among an increasing number of newly introduced entertainment software titles and hardware for adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support • other forms of entertainment such as motion pictures television and audio online computer programs and other forms of entertainment which may be less expensive or provide other advantages to consumers competition in the entertainment software industry is based on innovation features playability and product quality brand name recognition compatibility with popular platforms access to distribution channels price marketing and customer service our business is driven by hit titles which require increasing budgets for development and marketing competition for our titles is influenced by the timing of competitive product releases and the similarity of such products to our titles and may result in loss of shelf space or a reduction in sellthrough of our titles at retail stores 

trends and factors impacting our business 

product release schedule our financial results are affected by the timing of our product releases and the commercial success of those titles our grand theft auto products in particular have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue the timing of our grand theft auto releases varies significantly which in turn impacts our financial performance on a quarterly and annual basis 

economic environment and retailer performance we continue to monitor economic conditions which may have unfavorable impacts on our businesses such as deteriorating consumer demand pricing pressure on our products credit quality of our receivables and foreign currency exchange rates our business is dependent upon a limited number of customers who account for a significant portion of our revenue the economic environment has impacted our customers in the past and may do so in the future bankruptcies or consolidations of our large retail customers could seriously hurt our business due to uncollectible accounts receivables and the concentration of purchasing power among the remaining large retailers our business is also negatively impacted by the actions of certain of our large customers who sell used copies of our games which reduces demand for new copies of our games we now offer downloadable episodes and content for certain of our titles while this may serve to reduce some used game sales we expect sales of used games to continue to affect our business 

hardware platforms the majority of our products are made for the hardware platforms developed by three companies—sony microsoft and nintendo when new hardware platforms are introduced demand for software based on older platforms declines which may negatively affect our business additionally our 

development costs are generally higher for titles based on new platforms and we have limited ability to predict the consumer acceptance of the new platforms which may impact our sales and profitability as a result we believe it is important to focus our development efforts on a select number of titles which is consistent with our strategy 

international operations sales in international markets primarily in europe have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue we have also recently expanded our asian operations in an effort to increase our geographical scope and diversify our revenue base we are subject to risks associated with foreign trade including credit risks and consumer acceptance of our products and our financial results may be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

online content and digital distribution the interactive entertainment software industry is delivering a growing amount of content through digital online delivery methods we provide a variety of online delivered products and services a number of our titles that are available through retailers as packaged goods products are also available through direct digital download through the internet from websites owned by thirdparties we also offer downloadable addon content to our packaged goods titles in addition we have several initiatives underway to develop online games primarily for asian markets we expect online delivery of games and game services to become an increasing part of our business over the longterm 

international operations 

sales in international markets principally in the united kingdom and other countries in europe have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue for the fiscal years ended march 31 2011 and 2010 and fiscal years ended october 31 2009 and 2008 approximately 441 393 422 and 491 respectively of our net revenue was earned outside the united states we are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade including increased credit risks tariffs and duties fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates shipping delays and international political regulatory and economic developments all of which can have a significant impact on our operating results see notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

segment and geographic information 

see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements 

employees 

as of march 31 2011 we had 2118 fulltime employees of which 1200 were employed outside of the united states none of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements we consider our relations with employees to be satisfactory 




 item 1a risk factors 

our business is subject to many risks and uncertainties which may affect our future financial performance because of the risks and uncertainties described below as well as other factors affecting our operating results and financial condition past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance and our business and financial performance could be harmed and the market value of our securities could decline 

risks relating to our business 

we are dependent on the future success of our grand theft auto products and we must continue to publish hit titles or sequels to such hit titles in order to compete successfully in our industry 

grand theft auto and certain of our other titles are hit products and have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue if we fail to continue to develop and sell new commercially successful hit titles or sequels to such hit titles or experience any delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of our hit titles or their sequels our revenue and profits may decrease substantially and we may incur losses in addition competition in our industry is intense and a relatively small number of hit titles account for a large portion of total revenue in our industry hit products offered by our competitors may take a larger share of consumer spending than we anticipate which could cause revenue generated from our products to fall below our expectations if our competitors develop more successful products or services at lower price points or based on payment models perceived as offering better value such as payforplay or subscriptionbased models or if we do not continue to develop consistently high quality and wellreceived products and services our revenue and profitability may decline 

we are subject to product development risks which could result in delays and additional costs and we must adapt to changes in software technologies 

we depend on our internal development studios and thirdparty software developers to develop new interactive entertainment software within anticipated release schedules and cost projections the development cycle for new titles generally ranges from 12 to more than 24 months and our topselling titles could take up to 3 years or longer to develop development times and costs of current generation software have increased substantially as a result of the additional and enhanced features available in the newest games further after development of a product it may take between 9 and 12 additional months to develop the product for other hardware platforms if our thirdparty software developers experience unanticipated development delays financial difficulties or additional costs we will not be able to release titles according to our schedule and at budgeted costs certain of our licensing and marketing agreements also contain provisions that would impose penalties if we fail to meet agreed upon game release dates there can be no assurance that our products will be sufficiently successful so that we can recoup these costs or make a profit on these products 

additionally in order to stay competitive our internal development studios must anticipate and adapt to rapid technological changes affecting software development any inability to respond to technological advances and implement new technologies could render our products obsolete or less marketable 

the inability of our products to achieve significant market acceptance delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of our products may have a material adverse effect on our operating results 

new products may not achieve significant market acceptance generate sufficient sales or be introduced in a timely manner to permit us to recover development manufacturing and marketing costs associated with these products the life cycle of a title generally involves a relatively high level of sales during the first few months after introduction followed by a rapid decline in sales because revenue associated with an initial 

product launch generally constitutes a high percentage of the total revenue associated with the life of a product delays in product releases or disruptions following the commercial release of one or more new products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cause our operating results to be materially different from our expectations 

our business is subject to the continued popularity of current generation video game platforms our ability to develop commercially successful products for these platforms and the continued operation and security of the online networks for these platforms 

we derive most of our revenue from the sale of products for play on video game platforms manufactured by third parties such as sonys ps3 and psp microsofts xbox 360 and nintendos wii and ds the success of our business is subject to the continued popularity of these platforms and our ability to develop commercially successful products for these platforms 

certain of our products are onlineenabled the ability of our products to offer online functionality and our ability to offer content through a video game platforms digital distribution channel is dependent upon the continued operation and security of such platforms online network these thirdparty networks as well as our own internal systems and websites and the security measures related thereto may be breached as a result of thirdparty action including intentional misconduct by computer hackers employee error malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers data or our data including our intellectual property and other confidential business information or our information technology systems because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs we may lose business suffer irreparable damage to our reputation andor incur significant costs and expenses relating to the investigation and possible litigation of claims relating to such event we may be liable in such event for damages penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations and costs for remediation and efforts to prevent future occurrences any of which liabilities could be significant any theft andor unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an event could adversely affect our competitive position reputation brand and future sales of our products our business could be subject to significant disruption and we could suffer monetary and other losses and reputational harm in the event of such incidents and claims 

if we are unable to sustain launch pricing on current generation titles our operating results may suffer 

the interactive entertainment software and hardware industry is characterized by the introduction of new and enhanced generations of products and evolving industry standards current generation titles for the ps3 xbox 360 and wii have been offered at premium retail prices since the launch of such consoles we expect to continue to price current generation titles at a premium level however circumstances may arise in which we may need to reduce prices for such titles if we are unable to sustain launch pricing on these current generation titles it will have a material adverse effect on our margins profitability and operating results 

a lockout by nba owners or a strike by nba players could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

the nba players union and the owners of the nba teams are currently renegotiating their collective bargaining agreement which is set to expire following the 2010  2011 basketball season sales of 2ks annually released basketball game could be adversely affected in the event that the players are locked out or go on strike 

we depend on our key management and product development personnel 

our continued success will depend to a significant extent on our senior management team and our relationship with zelnickmedia corporation zelnickmedia our executive chairman and chief executive officer and chief operating officer are partners of zelnickmedia we are also highly dependent on the expertise skills and knowledge of certain of our rockstar employees responsible for content creation and development of our grand theft auto titles and titles based on other brands although we entered into employment agreements with members of the creative team of our rockstar games publishing label we may not be able to continue to retain these personnel at current compensation levels or at all 

the loss of the services of our executive officers zelnickmedia or our key rockstar employees could significantly harm our business in addition if one or more key employees were to join a competitor or form a competing company we may lose additional personnel experience material interruptions in product development delays in bringing products to market and difficulties in our relationships with licensors suppliers and customers which would significantly harm our business failure to continue to attract and retain other qualified management and creative personnel could adversely affect our business and prospects 

declines in consumer spending and other adverse changes in the economy could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

most of our products involve discretionary spending on the part of consumers we believe that consumer spending is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income this makes our products particularly sensitive to general economic conditions and economic cycles as consumers are generally more willing to make discretionary purchases including purchases of products like ours during periods in which favorable economic conditions prevail adverse economic conditions such as a prolonged us or international general economic downturn including periods of increased inflation unemployment levels tax rates interest rates energy prices or declining consumer confidence could also reduce consumer spending reduced consumer spending has and may continue to result in reduced demand for our products and may also require increased selling and promotional expenses which has had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and operating results furthermore uncertainty and adverse changes in the economy could also increase the risk of material losses on our investments increase costs associated with developing and publishing our products increase the cost and availability of sources of financing and increase our exposure to material losses from bad debts any of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results if economic conditions worsen our business financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected 

our quarterly operating results are dependent on the release of hit titles and are highly seasonal which may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate significantly 

we have experienced and may continue to experience wide fluctuations in quarterly operating results the release of a hit title typically leads to a high level of sales during the first few months after introduction followed by a rapid decline in sales in addition the interactive entertainment industry is highly seasonal with sales typically higher during the fourth calendar quarter due primarily to increased demand for games during the holiday season demand for and sales of our sports titles are also seasonal in that they are typically released just prior to the start of the sport season which they depict our failure or inability to produce hit titles or introduce products on a timely basis to meet seasonal fluctuations in demand could adversely affect our business and operating results the uncertainties associated with software development manufacturing lead times production delays and the approval process for products by 

hardware manufacturers and other licensors make it difficult to predict the quarter in which our products will ship and therefore may cause us to fail to meet financial expectations 

returns of our published titles by our customers and price concessions granted to our customers may adversely affect our operating results 

we are exposed to the risk of product returns and price concessions with respect to our customers our distribution arrangements with customers generally do not give them the right to return titles to us or to cancel firm orders however we sometimes accept product returns from our distribution customers for stock balancing and negotiate accommodations for customers which include credits and returns when demand for specific products falls below expectations we accept returns and grant price concessions in connection with our publishing arrangements and revenue is recognized after deducting estimated reserves for returns and price concessions while we believe that we can reliably estimate future returns and price concessions if return rates and price concessions for our products exceed our reserves our revenue could decline 

increased sales of used video game products could lower our sales 

certain of our larger customers sell used video games which are generally priced lower than new video games if our customers continue to increase their sales of used video games it could negatively affect our sales of new video games and have an adverse impact on our operating results 

a limited number of customers account for a significant portion of our sales the loss of a principal customer could seriously hurt our business 

a substantial portion of our product sales are made to a limited number of customers our sales are made primarily pursuant to purchase orders without longterm agreements or other commitments and our customers may terminate their relationship with us at any time certain of our customers may decline to carry products containing mature content the loss of our relationships with principal customers or a decline in sales to principal customers including as a result of a product being rated ao age 18 and over could materially adversely affect our business and operating results furthermore our customers may also be placed into bankruptcy become insolvent or be liquidated due to the current economic downturn the global contraction of credit or for other factors bankruptcies or consolidations of certain large retail customers could seriously hurt our business including as a result of uncollectible accounts receivable from such customers and the concentration of purchasing power among remaining large retailers 

if our marketing and advertising efforts fail to resonate with our customers our business and operating results could be adversely affected 

our products are marketed worldwide through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs such as television and online advertising print advertising retail merchandising website development and event sponsorship our ability to sell our products and services is dependent in part on the success of these programs if the marketing for our products and services fails to resonate with our customers particularly during the holiday season or other key selling periods or if advertising rates or other media placement costs increase these factors could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 

we rely on a limited number of thirdparty distributers for a significant portion of our products and the failure of these service providers to perform as expected could harm our operating results 

we sell our products to our customers worldwide primarily through a limited number of thirdparty distributers these thirdparties provide shipping receiving warehouse management and related functions 

if these services are not performed in a satisfactory manner or if we desire or are required to replace one or more of our primary distributors and are unable to do so our sales and operating results could suffer 

the interactive entertainment software industry is highly competitive 

we compete for both licenses to properties and the sale of interactive entertainment software with sony microsoft and nintendo each of which is a large developer and marketer of software for its own platforms we also compete with domestic game publishers such as activision blizzard electronic arts and thq and international publishers such as capcom konami namcobandai sega square enix and ubisoft as our business is dependent upon our ability to develop hit titles which require increasing budgets for development and marketing the availability of significant financial resources has become a major competitive factor in developing and marketing software games some of our competitors have greater financial technical personnel and other resources than we do and are able to finance larger budgets for development and marketing and make higher offers to licensors and developers for commercially desirable properties our titles also compete with other forms of entertainment such as social media and casual games in addition to motion pictures television and audio and video products featuring similar themes online computer programs and other entertainment which may be less expensive or provide other advantages to consumers 

a number of software publishers who compete with us have developed and commercialized or are currently developing online games for use by consumers over the internet if technological advances significantly increase the availability of online games and if consumer acceptance of online gaming grows substantially it could result in a decline in our platformbased software sales and negatively impact sales of our products 

increased competition for limited shelf space and promotional support from retailers could affect the success of our business and require us to incur greater expenses to market our titles 

retailers have limited shelf space and promotional resources and competition is intense among newly introduced interactive entertainment software titles for adequate levels of shelf space and promotional support competition for retail shelf space is expected to continue to increase which may require us to increase our marketing expenditures to maintain desirable sales levels of our titles competitors with more extensive lines and more popular titles may have greater bargaining power with retailers accordingly we may not be able or we may have to pay more than our competitors to achieve similar levels of promotional support and shelf space 

our business is dependent on our ability to enter into successful software development arrangements with thirdparties 

our success depends on our ability to continually identify and develop new titles on a timely basis we rely on thirdparty software developers for the development of some of our titles quality thirdparty developers are continually in high demand software developers who have developed titles for us in the past may not be available to develop software for us in the future due to the limited number of thirdparty software developers and the limited control that we exercise over them these developers may not be able to complete titles for us on a timely basis or within acceptable quality standards if at all we have entered into agreements with thirdparties to acquire the rights to publish and distribute interactive entertainment software as well as to use licensed intellectual properties in our titles these agreements typically require us to make development payments pay royalties and satisfy other conditions our development payments may not be sufficient to permit developers to develop new software successfully which could result in material delays and significantly increase our costs to bring particular products to market software development costs promotion and marketing expenses and royalties payable to software developers and thirdparty licensors have increased significantly in recent years and reduce potential profits derived from 

sales of our software future sales of our titles may not be sufficient to recover development payments and advances to software developers and licensors and we may not have adequate financial and other resources to satisfy our contractual commitments to such developers if we fail to satisfy our obligations under agreements with thirdparty developers and licensors the agreements may be terminated or modified in ways that are burdensome to us and have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and operating results 

we cannot publish our titles without the approval of hardware licensors that are also our competitors 

we are required to obtain licenses from sony microsoft and nintendo which are also our competitors to develop and publish titles for their respective hardware platforms our existing platform licenses require that we obtain approval for the publication of new titles on a titlebytitle basis as a result the number of titles we are able to publish for these hardware platforms our ability to manage the timing of the release of these titles and accordingly our net revenue from titles for these hardware platforms may be limited if a licensor chooses not to renew or extend our license agreement at the end of its current term or if a licensor were to terminate our license for any reason or does not approve one or more of our titles we may be unable to publish that title as well as additional titles for that licensors platform termination of any such agreements or disapproval of titles could seriously hurt our business and prospects we may be unable to continue to enter into license agreements for certain current generation platforms on satisfactory terms or at all failure to enter into any such agreement could also seriously hurt our business 

our platform licensors control the fee structures for online distribution of our games on their platforms 

certain platform licensors have retained the right to change the fee structures for online distribution of both paid content and free content including patches and corrections on their platforms each licensors ability to set royalty rates may increase costs which could negatively impact our operating margins we may be unable to distribute our content in a costeffective or profitable manner through this distribution channel which could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

we may not be able to adequately adjust our cost structure in a timely fashion in response to a sudden decrease in demand 

a significant portion of our selling and general and administrative expense is attributable to expenses for personnel and facilities in the event of a significant decline in revenue we may not be able to dispose of facilities reduce personnel or make other changes to our cost structure without disruption to our operations or without significant termination and exit costs management may not be able to implement such actions in a timely manner if at all to offset an immediate shortfall in revenue and profit moreover reducing costs may impair our ability to produce and develop software titles at sufficient levels in the future 

we submit our products for rating by the entertainment software rating board esrb in the united states and other voluntary or government ratings organizations in foreign countries failure to obtain a target rating for certain of our products could negatively impact our ability to distribute and sell those games as could the rerating of a game for any reason 

we voluntarily submit our game products to the esrb a usbased nonprofit and independent ratings organization the esrb system provides consumers with information about game content using a rating symbol that generally suggests the appropriate player age group and specific content descriptors such as graphic violence profanity or sexually explicit material the esrb may impose significant penalties on game publishers for violations of its rules related to rating or marketing games including revocation of a rating or monetary fines up to 1 million other countries require voluntary or government backed ratings as prerequisites for product sales in some instances we may have to modify our products in order to 

market them under the target rating which could delay or disrupt the release of our products in addition some of our titles may not be sold at all or without extensive edits in certain countries such as germany 

in the united states if the esrb rates a game as ao age 18 and older platform licensors may not certify the game and retailers may refuse to sell it in addition some consumers have reacted to reratings or controversial game content by refusing to purchase such games demanding refunds for games that they had already purchased and refraining from buying other games published by us many of our rockstar titles and certain of our 2k games titles have been rated m age 17 and older by the esrb if we are unable to obtain m ratings and instead receive ao ratings on future versions of those or similar titles as a result of changes in the esrbs ratings standards or for other reasons including the adoption of legislation in this area our business and prospects could be negatively affected if any of our games are rerated by the esrb or other foreign based ratings organizations we could be exposed to litigation administrative fines and penalties and other potential liabilities and our operating results and financial condition could be significantly impacted 

we have implemented processes to comply with the requirements of the esrb and other ratings organizations and properly display the designated rating symbols and content descriptions nonetheless these processes are subject to human error circumvention overriding and reasonable resource constraints if a video game we published were found to contain undisclosed pertinent content the esrb could rerate a game retailers could refuse to sell it and demand that we accept the return of any unsold copies or returns from customers and consumers could refuse to buy it or demand that we refund their money this could have a material negative impact on our operating results and financial condition in addition we may be exposed to litigation administrative fines and penalties and our reputation could be harmed which could impact sales of other video games we sell if any of these consequences were to occur our business and financial performance could be significantly harmed 

content policies adopted by retailers consumer opposition and litigation could negatively impact sales of our products 

retailers may decline to sell interactive entertainment software containing what they judge to be graphic violence or sexually explicit material or other content that they deem inappropriate for their businesses if retailers decline to sell our products based upon their opinion that they contain objectionable themes graphic violence or sexually explicit material or other generally objectionable content or if any of our previously m rated series products are rated ao we might be required to significantly change or discontinue particular titles or series which in the case of our best selling grand theft auto titles could seriously affect our business consumer advocacy groups have opposed sales of interactive entertainment software containing objectionable themes violence or sexual material or other objectionable content by pressing for legislation in these areas and by engaging in public demonstrations and media campaigns additionally although lawsuits seeking damages for injuries allegedly suffered by thirdparties as a result of video games have generally been unsuccessful in the courts claims of this kind have been asserted against us from time to time and may be asserted and be successful in the future 

we are subject to risks and uncertainties of international trade including fluctuations in the values of local foreign currencies against the dollar 

sales in international markets primarily in europe have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue we have also recently expanded our asian operations in an effort to increase our geographical scope and diversify our revenue base we are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade including increased credit risks tariffs and duties fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates shipping delays and international political regulatory and economic developments all of which can have a significant impact on our operating results all of our international sales are made in local currencies which could fluctuate against the dollar while we may use forward exchange contracts to a limited extent to seek to mitigate 

foreign currency risk our operating results could be adversely affected by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations 

we face risks from our international operations 

we are subject to certain risks because of our international operations particularly as we continue to grow our business and presence in asia latin america and other parts of the world changes to and compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations may increase our cost of doing business and our inability or failure to obtain required approvals could harm our international and domestic sales trade legislation in either the united states or other countries such as a change in the current tariff structures importexport compliance laws or other trade laws or policies could adversely affect our ability to sell or to distribute in international markets we incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our international operations and could become subject to legal penalties in foreign countries if we do not comply with local laws and regulations which may be substantially different from those in the united states in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it may be common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by united states laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and by local laws such as laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations including those based in or from countries where practices which violate such laws may be customary will not take actions in violation of our policies any such violation even if prohibited by our policies could have a material adverse effect on our business 

if we are unable to protect the intellectual property relating to our software the commercial value of our products will be adversely affected and our competitive position could be harmed 

we develop proprietary software and have obtained the rights to publish and distribute software developed by thirdparties we attempt to protect our software and production techniques under copyright trademark and trade secret laws as well as through contractual restrictions on disclosure copying and distribution our software is susceptible to piracy and unauthorized copying unauthorized thirdparties may be able to copy or to reverse engineer our software to obtain and use programming or production techniques that we regard as proprietary well organized piracy operations have also proliferated in recent years resulting in the ability to download pirated copies of our software over the internet although we attempt to incorporate protective measures into our software piracy of our products could negatively impact our future profitability 

if we infringe on or are alleged to infringe on the intellectual property rights of thirdparties our business could be adversely affected 

as our industry grows we may be subject to an increasing amount of litigation that is common in the software industry based on allegations of infringement or other alleged violations of patent copyright andor trademarks in addition we believe that interactive entertainment software will increasingly become the subject of claims that such software infringes on the intellectual property rights of others with both the growth of online functionality and advances in technology game content and software graphics as games become more realistic from time to time we receive notices from thirdparties or are named in lawsuits by thirdparties alleging infringement of their proprietary rights although we believe that our software and technologies and the software and technologies of thirdparty developers and publishers with whom we have contractual relations do not and will not infringe or violate proprietary rights of others it is possible that infringement of proprietary rights of others may occur any claims of infringement with or without merit could be time consuming costly and difficult to defend moreover intellectual property litigation or claims could require us to discontinue the distribution of products obtain a license or redesign our products which could result in additional substantial costs and material delays 

data breaches involving the source code for our products could adversely affect our revenues 

we securely store the source code for our interactive entertainment software products as it is created a breach whether physical electronic or otherwise of the systems on which such source code and other sensitive data is stored could lead to damage or piracy of our software if we are subject to data security breaches we may have a loss in sales or increased costs arising from the restoration or implementation of additional security measures which could materially and adversely affect our profitability 

our software is susceptible to errors which can harm our financial results and reputation 

the technological advancements of new hardware platforms result in the development of more complex software products as software products become more complex the risk of undetected errors in new products increases we may need to produce and distribute patches in order to repair such errors which could be costly and may distract our developers from working on new products if despite testing errors are found in new products or releases after shipments have been made we could experience a loss of or delay in timely market acceptance product returns loss of revenue increases in costs relating to the repair of such errors and damage to our reputation 

if we acquire or invest in other businesses intellectual properties or other assets we may be unable to integrate them with our business our financial performance may be impaired andor we may not realize the anticipated financial and strategic goals for such transactions 

if appropriate opportunities present themselves we may acquire or make investments in businesses intellectual properties and other assets that we believe are strategic we may not be able to identify negotiate or finance any future acquisition or investment successfully even if we do succeed in acquiring or investing in a business intellectual property or other asset such acquisitions and investments involve a number of risks including 

• retaining key employees and maintaining the key business and customer relationships of the businesses we acquire • cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from an acquired company or business into our organization • the possibility that the combined company would not achieve the expected benefits including any anticipated operating and product synergies of the acquisition as quickly as anticipated or that the costs of or operational difficulties arising from an acquisition would be greater than anticipated • significant acquisitionrelated accounting adjustments particularly relating to an acquired companys deferred revenue that may cause reported revenue and profits of the combined company to be lower than the sum of their standalone revenue and profits • significant accounting charges resulting from the completion and integration of a sizeable acquisition and increased capital expenditures including potential impairment charges incurred to write down the carrying amount of intangible assets generated as a result of an acquisition • the possibility that we will not discover important facts during due diligence that could have a material adverse impact on the value of the businesses we acquire including the possibility that a change of control of a company we acquire triggers a termination of contractual or intellectual property rights important to the operation of its business • the need to integrate an acquired companys accounting management information human resource and other administrative systems to permit effective management and timely reporting and the need to implement or remediate controls procedures and policies appropriate for a public company 18 

in an acquired company that prior to the acquisition lacked these controls procedures and policies 

• litigation or other claims in connection with or inheritance of claims or litigation risks as a result of an acquisition including claims from terminated employees customers or other thirdparties and • to the extent that we engage in strategic transactions outside of the united states we face additional risks including risks related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages currency risks and the particular economic political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries future acquisitions and investments could also involve the issuance of our equity and equitylinked securities potentially diluting our existing stockholders the incurrence of debt contingent liabilities or amortization expenses writeoffs of goodwill intangibles or acquired inprocess technology or other increased cash and noncash expenses such as stock based compensation any of the foregoing factors could harm our financial condition or prevent us from achieving improvements in our financial condition and operating performance that could have otherwise been achieved by us on a standalone basis our stockholders may not have the opportunity to review vote on or evaluate future acquisitions or investments 

our ability to acquire and maintain licenses to intellectual property especially for sports titles impacts our revenue and profitability competition for these licenses may make them more expensive and increase our costs 

certain of our products are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others for example our 2k sports products include rights licensed from major sports leagues and players associations similarly some of our other titles are based on licenses of popular entertainment products competition for these licenses is intense if we are unable to maintain these licenses or obtain additional licenses on reasonable economic terms or with significant commercial value our revenue and profitability could decline significantly competition for these licenses may also increase the advances guarantees and royalties that we must pay to the licensor which could significantly increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability in addition on certain intellectual property licenses we are subject to guaranteed minimum payments royalties or standards of performance and may not be able to terminate these agreements prior to their stated expiration if such licensed products do not generate revenues in excess of such minimum guarantees our profitability will be adversely impacted 

we are subject to contractual covenants which place certain limitations on how we manage our business  

our credit agreement and the indenture governing our convertible senior notes limit our ability to take various actions including incurring additional debt paying dividends repurchasing shares and acquiring or disposing of assets or businesses in addition we have granted a security interest in connection with certain compensatory arrangements which limits our ability to incur senior debt in excess of certain amounts accordingly we may be restricted from taking actions that management believes would be desirable and in the best interests of us and our stockholders our credit agreement and the indenture also require us to satisfy specified financial and nonfinancial covenants a breach of any of the covenants contained in our credit agreement could result in an event of default under the agreement and under the indenture governing our convertible senior notes and would allow our lenders and noteholders to pursue various remedies including accelerating the repayment of any outstanding indebtedness 

our involvement and the involvement of some of our former executive officers in a wide variety of lawsuits investigations and proceedings has had and may in the future have a material adverse effect on us 

we and some of our former officers directors and employees have been the subject of three separate governmental investigations and a substantial amount of litigation and other proceedings relating to the 

subject matter of those investigations while most of these matters have been resolved these investigations litigation and other proceedings have imposed significant costs on us including professional fees penalties and settlement costs and the diversion of the time and attention of our management team we may be subject to heightened scrutiny in the future as a result of our historical legal proceedings including an increased likelihood of a government investigation occurring and an increased likelihood that any such investigation is more extensive than in the past furthermore any future fines restrictions or other penalties imposed as a result of any such investigation may be more severe than those which may be imposed on a company without our history 

our business and products are subject to potential legislation the adoption of such proposed legislation could limit the retail market for our products 

several proposals have been made for federal legislation to regulate our industry such proposals seek to prohibit the sale of products containing content included in some of our games if any such proposals are enacted into law it may limit the potential market for some of our games in the united states and adversely affect our operating results other countries such as germany have adopted laws regulating content both in packaged games and those transmitted over the internet that are stricter than current united states laws in the united states proposals have also been made by numerous state legislators to regulate and prohibit the sale of interactive entertainment software products containing certain types of violent or sexual content to under 17 or 18 audiences such as the state of californias ultraviolent video games law that sought to ban the sale or rental of violent video games to minors while such legislation to date has been enjoined by industry and retail groups or been found unconstitutional the adoption into law of such legislation in federal andor in state jurisdictions in which we do significant business could severely limit the retail market for some of our games 

we may need additional capital if we incur losses 

if we incur losses in the future we may be required to raise additional capital in order to fund our operations we could seek to raise capital in a number of ways including through the issuance of debt or equity or through other financing arrangements during the fiscal year ended october 31 2007 we entered into a senior secured line of credit agreement and expanded the line of credit in november 2007 which requires us to make periodic interest or other debt service payments in addition during the fiscal year ended october 31 2009 we issued convertible senior notes which require us to make periodic interest payments to the holders of the convertible senior notes if we borrow additional funds further debt service payments would probably be necessary in addition the terms of additional debt may impose significant restrictions on our ability to operate our business if we seek financing through the sale of equity or equitybased securities such as our convertible senior notes our current stockholders will suffer dilution in their percentage ownership of common stock we cannot be certain as to our ability to raise additional capital in the future or under what terms capital would be available particularly in light of the recent economic downturn which has among other consequences led to the depression of stock prices and the tightening of credit if we need to raise capital and are not successful in doing so we will have to consider other options that may include but are not limited to a reduction in our expenditures for internal and external new product development reductions in overhead expenses and sales of intellectual property and other assets these actions should they become necessary will likely result in a reduction in the size of our operations and could materially affect the prospects of our business 

we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill becomes impaired 

we are required under generally accepted accounting principles to review our goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating a requirement to reevaluate whether our goodwill continues to be recoverable include a significant decline in stock price 

and market capitalization slower growth rates in our industry or other materially adverse events we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill is determined this may adversely impact our operating results 

our reported financial results could be adversely affected by the application of existing or future accounting standards to our business as it evolves 

the frequency of accounting policy changes may continue to accelerate for example standards regarding software revenue recognition have and could further significantly affect the way we account for revenue related to our products and services we expect that a significant portion of our games will be online enabled in the future and we could be required to recognize the related revenue over an extended period of time rather than at the time of sale as we enhance expand and diversify our business and product offerings the application of existing or future financial accounting standards particularly those relating to the way we account for revenue could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results although not necessarily on our cash flows 

risks relating to our common stock 

for purposes of this section —risks relating to our common stock references to the company we our and us refer only to taketwo interactive software inc and not to its subsidiaries 

additional issuances of equity securities by us would dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders 

we may issue equity or equitybased securities such as our convertible senior notes in the future in connection with acquisitions or strategic transactions to adjust our ratio of debt to equity including through repayment of outstanding debt to fund expansion of our operations or for other purposes to the extent we issue additional equity securities the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders would be reduced 

future sales or other issuances of our common stock could adversely affect its market price 

the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely impact its price the sale or the availability for sale of a large number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause the price of our common stock to decline the issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of our convertible senior notes could also adversely affect the price of our common stock 

our stock price has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly 

the market price of our common stock historically has been and we expect will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us including those discussed in the risk factors in this section as well as others not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material to changes in securities analysts earnings estimates or ratings to our results or future financial guidance falling below our expectations and analysts and investors expectations to factors affecting the computer software entertainment media or electronics industries or to national or international economic conditions 

stock markets in general have experienced over the years and continue to experience significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected market prices for companies such as ours and that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the affected companies these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock regardless of our operating performance 

the convertible senior note hedge and warrant transactions entered into in connection with the offering of our convertible senior notes may affect the value of the notes and our common stock 

in connection with the offering of our convertible senior notes we entered into convertible senior note hedge transactions which are expected to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the notes however we also entered into warrant transactions which could separately have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants in addition the counterparties to the hedge and warrant transactions andor their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock andor purchasing or selling our common stock in secondary market transactions at any time prior to the maturity of the notes and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of notes this activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the notes 

delaware law our charter documents and provisions of our debt agreements may impede or discourage a takeover which could cause the market price of our shares to decline 

we are a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a thirdparty to acquire control of us even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders our board has the power without stockholder approval to adopt a stockholder rights plan andor to designate the terms of one or more series of preferred stock and issue shares of preferred stock in addition we may under certain circumstances involving a change of control be obligated to repurchase all or a portion of our convertible senior notes and any potential acquirer would be required to assume our obligations related to any outstanding notes we or any possible acquirer may not have available financial resources necessary to repurchase those notes the ability of our board to create and issue a new series of preferred stock and certain provisions of delaware law our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the indenture governing our notes could impede a merger takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock which under certain circumstances could reduce the market price of our common stock and the value of any outstanding notes 

our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future years taxes could be substantially limited if we experience an ownership change as defined in the internal revenue code 

section 382 of the internal revenue code contains rules that limit the ability of a company to use its net operating loss carryforwards in years after an ownership change which is generally defined as any change in ownership of more than 50 of its stock over a threeyear testing period these rules generally operate by focusing on ownership changes among stockholders owning directly or indirectly 5 or more of the stock of a company andor any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of stock by the company if as a result of future transactions involving our common stock including purchases or sales of stock by 5 stockholders we undergo cumulative ownership changes which exceed 50 over the testing period our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards would be subject to additional limitations under section 382 

generally if an ownership change occurs the annual taxable income limitation on the use of net operating loss carryforwards is equal to the product of the applicable longterm tax exempt rate and the value of the companys stock immediately before the ownership change depending on the resulting limitation a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards could expire before we would be able to use them 

our inability to fully utilize our net operating losses to offset taxable income generated in the future could have a material and negative impact on our future financial position and results of operations

we endeavor to be the most creative innovative and efficient company in our industry our strategy is to capitalize on the widespread popularity of interactive entertainment by focusing on publishing a select number of high quality titles for which we can create sequels and build successful franchises we develop and market most of our frontline products internally and own the intellectual property associated with most of our titles which we believe best positions us financially and competitively we have established a portfolio of proprietary software content for the major hardware platforms in a wide range of genres including action adventure racing roleplaying sports and strategy which we distribute worldwide we believe that our commitment to creativity and innovation is a distinguishing strength allowing us to differentiate many of our products in the marketplace by combining advanced technology with compelling storylines and characters that provide unique gameplay experiences for consumers we have created acquired or licensed a group of highly recognizable brands to match the variety of consumer demographics we aspire to serve ranging from adults to children and game enthusiasts to casual gamers 

our revenue is primarily derived from the sale of internally developed software titles and software titles developed by thirdparties for our benefit operating margins are dependent in part upon our ability to continually release new commercially successful products and to manage software product development costs we have internal development studios located in australia canada china czech republic the united kingdom and the united states 

we expect rockstar games our whollyowned publisher of the grand theft auto  midnight club  red dead and other popular franchises to continue to be a leader in the action product category and create groundbreaking entertainment by leveraging our existing titles as well as developing new brands software titles published by our rockstar games label are primarily internally developed we believe that rockstar has established a uniquely original popular cultural phenomenon with its grand theft auto series and continues to expand on our established franchises by releasing sequels as well as offering downloadable episodes and content rockstar is also well known for developing brands in other genres including the bully  manhunt and max payne franchises 

2k games has published a variety of popular entertainment properties across multiple genres and platforms and we expect 2k games to continue to develop new and successful franchises in the future 2k games internally owned and developed franchises include the critically acclaimed multimillion unit selling bioshock  mafia  and sid meiers civilization series 2k games has also published titles that were externally developed such as the darkness ™ and borderlands ™ which has become another key franchise for 2k games since its launch in october 2009 

our 2k sports series which includes major league baseball 2k  nba 2k and nhl 2k  provides annual revenue streams since they are generally published on a yearly basis we develop most of our 2k sports software titles through our internal development studios including the major league baseball 2k series nba 2k series nhl 2k series and our top spin tennis series 2k sports has secured longterm thirdparty exclusive licensing relationships with major league baseball properties the major league baseball players association and major league baseball advanced media in addition 2k sports has secured licensing agreements with the national basketball association nba and the national hockey league nhl nba 2k is the top rated and top selling basketball simulation franchise through march 2011 according to gamerankingcom and the npd group estimates of us retail video game sales

discontinued operations 

in february 2010 we completed the sale to synnex corporation synnex of our jack of all games thirdparty distribution business which primarily distributed thirdparty interactive entertainment software hardware and accessories in north america for approximately 440 million including 373 million in cash subject to purchase price adjustments and up to an additional 67 million subject to the achievement of certain items which were not met in april 2011 we settled on the purchase price adjustments and as a result the purchase price was lowered by 15 million consequently the net purchase price after the settlement was 358 million the financial results of this business which were previously reported as our distribution business have been classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented the assets and liabilities of this business are reflected as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations 

trends and factors impacting our business 

product release schedule our financial results are affected by the timing of our product releases and the commercial success of those titles our grand theft auto products in particular have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our revenue the timing of our grand theft auto releases varies significantly which in turn impacts our financial performance on a quarterly and annual basis 

economic environment and retailer performance we continue to monitor economic conditions which may have unfavorable impacts on our businesses such as deteriorating consumer demand pricing pressure 

on our products credit quality of our receivables and foreign currency exchange rates our business is dependent upon a limited number of customers who account for a significant portion of our revenue the economic environment has impacted our customers in the past and may do so in the future bankruptcies or consolidations of our large retail customers could seriously hurt our business due to uncollectible accounts receivables and the concentration of purchasing power among the remaining large retailers our business is also negatively impacted by the actions of certain of our large customers who sell used copies of our games which reduces demand for new copies of our games we now offer downloadable episodes for certain of our titles while this may serve to reduce some used game sales we expect sales of used games to continue to affect our business 

hardware platforms the majority of our products are made for the hardware platforms developed by three companies—sony microsoft and nintendo the success of our business is dependent upon the consumer acceptance of these platforms and the continued growth in the installed base of these platforms when new hardware platforms are introduced demand for software based on older platforms declines which may negatively affect our business additionally our development costs are generally higher for titles based on new platforms and we have limited ability to predict the consumer acceptance of the new platforms which may impact our sales and profitability as a result we believe it is important to focus our development efforts on a select number of titles which is consistent with our strategy 

international operations sales in international markets primarily in europe have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue we have also recently expanded our asian operations in an effort to increase our geographical scope and diversify our revenue base we are subject to risks associated with foreign trade including credit risks and consumer acceptance of our products and our financial results may be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

online content and digital distribution the interactive entertainment software industry is delivering a growing amount of content through digital online delivery methods we provide a variety of online delivered products and services a number of our titles that are available through retailers as packaged goods products are also available through direct digital download through the internet from websites we own and others owned by thirdparties we also offer downloadable addon content to our packaged goods titles in addition we have several initiatives underway to develop online games primarily for asian markets we expect online delivery of games and game services to become an increasing part of our business over the longterm

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods we base our estimates assumptions and judgments on historical experience current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared on a regular basis management reviews the accounting policies assumptions estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are fairly presented in accordance with gaap however because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 

we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our financial results and they require managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 

revenue recognition 

we recognize revenue upon the transfer of title and risk of loss to our customers accordingly we recognize revenue for software titles when there is 1 persuasive evidence that an arrangement with the customer exists which is generally based on a customer purchase order 2 the product is delivered 3 the selling price is fixed or determinable and 4 collection of the customer receivable is deemed probable certain products are sold to customers with a street date  ie the earliest date these products may be sold by retailers for these products we recognize revenue on the later of the street date or the sale date 

our payment arrangements with customers typically provide net 30 and 60 day terms advances received for licensing and exclusivity arrangements are reported on our consolidated balance sheets as deferred revenue until we meet our performance obligations at which point we recognize the revenue 

some of our software products provide limited online functionality at no additional cost to the consumer generally we consider such features to be incidental to the overall product offering and an inconsequential deliverable accordingly we do not defer revenue related to products containing such online features we determine whether our products contain substantial online functionality by evaluating the significance of the development effort and the nature of the online features the extent of anticipated marketing focus on the online features the significance of the online features to the customers anticipated overall gameplay experience and the significance of our post sale obligations to customers overall online play functionality is still an emerging area for us and we continue to monitor this developing functionality and its significance to our products 

in addition some of our software products are sold exclusively as downloads of digital content for which the consumer takes possession of the digital content for a fee revenue from product downloads is 

generally recognized when the download is made available assuming all other recognition criteria are met 

certain of our software products include ingame advertising for thirdparty products advance payments received for ingame advertising are reported on the balance sheet as deferred revenue until we meet our performance obligations at which point we recognize the revenue which is generally at the time of the initial release of the product 

revenue is recognized after deducting estimated reserves for returns price concessions and other allowances in circumstances when we do not have a reliable basis to estimate returns and price concessions or are unable to determine that collection of a receivable is probable we defer the revenue until such time as we can reliably estimate any related returns and allowances and determine that collection of the receivable is probable 

allowances for returns price concessions and other allowances 

we accept returns and grant price concessions in connection with our publishing arrangements following reductions in the price of our products we grant price concessions to permit customers to take credits against amounts they owe us with respect to merchandise unsold by them our customers must satisfy certain conditions to entitle them to return products or receive price concessions including compliance with applicable payment terms and confirmation of field inventory levels 

our distribution arrangements with customers generally do not give them the right to return titles or to cancel firm orders however we occasionally accept returns from our customers for stock balancing and make accommodations to customers which include credits and returns when demand for specific titles falls below expectations 

we make estimates of future product returns and price concessions related to current period product revenue we estimate the amount of future returns and price concessions for published titles based upon among other factors historical experience and performance of the titles in similar genres historical performance of the hardware platform customer inventory levels analysis of sellthrough rates sales force and retail customer feedback industry pricing market conditions and changes in demand and acceptance of our products by consumers 

significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for returns and price concessions in any accounting period we believe we can make reliable estimates of returns and price concessions however actual results may differ from initial estimates as a result of changes in circumstances market conditions and assumptions adjustments to estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 

software development costs and licenses 

capitalized software development costs include direct costs incurred for internally developed titles and payments made to thirdparty software developers under development agreements 

we capitalize internal software development costs including stockbased compensation specifically identifiable employee payroll expense and incentive compensation costs related to the completion and release of titles thirdparty production and other content costs subsequent to establishing technological feasibility of a software title technological feasibility of a product includes the completion of both technical design documentation and game design documentation significant management judgment and estimates are utilized in establishing technological feasibility 

we enter into agreements with thirdparty developers that require us to make payments for game development and production services in exchange for these payments we receive the exclusive publishing and distribution rights to the finished game title as well as in some cases the underlying intellectual property rights such agreements allow us to fully recover these payments to the developers at an agreed 

upon royalty rate earned on the subsequent retail sales of such software net of any agreed upon costs we capitalize all development and production service payments to thirdparty developers as software development costs on a productbyproduct basis we reduce software development costs and record a corresponding amount of research and development expense for any costs incurred by thirdparty developers prior to establishing technological feasibility of a product we typically enter into agreements with thirdparty developers after completing the technical design documentation for our products and therefore record the design costs leading up to a signed development contract as research and development expense when we contract with thirdparty developers we generally select thirdparty developers that have proven technology and experience in the genre of the software being developed which often allows for the establishment of technological feasibility early in the development cycle in instances where the documentation of the design and technology are not in place prior to an executed contract we monitor the software development process and require our thirdparty developers to adhere to the same technological feasibility standards that apply to our internally developed products 

licenses consist of payments and guarantees made to holders of intellectual property rights for use of their trademarks copyrights or other intellectual property rights in the development of our products agreements with license holders generally provide for guaranteed minimum royalty payments for use of their intellectual property guaranteed minimum payments are initially recorded as an asset licenses and as a liability accrued licenses upon execution of a licensing agreement provided that no significant performance remains to be completed by the licensor when significant performance remains to be completed by the licensor we record payments when actually paid 

certain licenses especially those related to our sports products extend over multiyear periods and encompass multiple game titles in addition to guaranteed minimum payments these licenses frequently contain provisions that could require us to pay royalties to the license holder based on preagreed unit sales thresholds 

amortization of capitalized software development costs and licenses commences when a product is released and is recorded on a titlebytitle basis in cost of goods sold for capitalized software development costs amortization is calculated using 1 the proportion of current year revenues to the total revenues expected to be recorded over the life of the title or 2 the straightline method over the remaining estimated useful life of the title whichever is greater for capitalized licenses amortization is calculated as a ratio of 1 current period revenues to the total revenues expected to be recorded over the remaining life of the title or 2 the contractual royalty rate based on actual net product sales as defined in the licensing agreement whichever is greater 

significant management judgments and estimates are utilized in the assessment of the recoverability of capitalized software costs at each balance sheet date or earlier if an indicator of impairment exists we evaluate the recoverability of capitalized software costs licenses and any other unrecognized minimum commitments that have not been paid using an undiscounted future cash flow analysis we use various measures to evaluate expected product performance and estimate future revenues for our software titles including historical performance of comparable titles orders for titles prior to release and the estimated performance of a sequel title based on the performance of the title on which the sequel is based when management determines that the value of a title is unlikely to be recovered by product sales capitalized costs are charged to cost of goods sold in the period in which such determination is made 

we have established profit and unit sales based internal royalty programs that provide for certain of our employees to participate in the success of software titles that they assist in developing royalties earned by employees under this program are recorded as cost of goods sold as they are incurred 

fair value estimates 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap often requires us to determine the fair value of a particular item to fairly present our consolidated financial statements without an independent 

market or another representative transaction determining the fair value of a particular item requires us to make several assumptions that are inherently difficult to predict and can have a material impact on the conclusion of the appropriate accounting 

there are various valuation techniques used to estimate fair value these include 1 the market approach where market transactions for identical or comparable assets or liabilities are used to determine the fair value 2 the income approach which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts for example future cash flows or future earnings to a single present amount and 3 the cost approach which is based on the amount that would be required to replace an asset for many of our fair value estimates including our estimates of the fair value of acquired intangible assets we use the income approach using the income approach requires the use of financial models which require us to make various estimates including but not limited to 1 the potential future cash flows for the asset liability or equity instrument being measured 2 the timing of receipt or payment of those future cash flows 3 the time value of money associated with the delayed receipt or payment of such cash flows and 4 the inherent risk associated with the cash flows risk premium making these cash flow estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and if any of the estimates used to determine the fair value using the income approach turns out to be inaccurate our financial results may be negatively impacted furthermore relatively small changes in many of these estimates can have a significant impact on the estimated fair value resulting from the financial models or the related accounting conclusion reached for example a relatively small change in the estimated fair value of an asset may change a conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired while we are required to make certain fair value assessments associated with the accounting for several types of transactions the following areas are the most sensitive to the assessments 

inventory obsolescence we regularly review inventory quantities onhand and in the retail channels and record an inventory provision for excess or obsolete inventory based on the future expected demand for our products significant changes in demand for our products would impact managements estimates in establishing our inventory provision we write down inventory based on excess or obsolete inventories determined primarily by future anticipated demand for our products inventory writedowns are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market value based upon assumptions about future demand that are inherently difficult to assess 

business combinations—goodwill and intangible assets we must estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these can have a material effect on our reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various lives furthermore a change in the estimated fair value of an asset or liability often has a direct impact on the amount to recognize as goodwill which is an asset that is not amortized often determining the fair value of these assets and liabilities assumed requires an assessment of expected use of the asset the expected cost to extinguish the liability or our expectations related to the timing and the successful completion of development of an acquired inprocess technology such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our financial statements 

we use either the income cost or market approach to aid in our conclusions of such fair values and asset lives the income approach presumes that the value of an asset can be estimated by the net economic benefit to be received over the life of the asset discounted to present value the cost approach presumes that an investor would pay no more for an asset than its replacement or reproduction cost the market approach estimates value based on what other participants in the market have paid for reasonably similar assets although each valuation approach is considered in valuing the assets acquired the approach ultimately selected is based on the characteristics of the asset and the availability of information 

we evaluate our goodwill annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount the determination of whether or not goodwill has become impaired involves a significant level of judgment in the assumptions underlying the approach used to determine the value of our reporting units changes in our strategy andor market 

conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require reductions to recorded intangible asset balances 

longlived assets we review longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable determining whether impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions including determining which cash flows are directly related to the potentially impaired asset the useful life over which cash flows will occur their amount and the assets residual value if any in turn measurement of an impairment loss requires a determination of fair value which is based on the best information available we use internal discounted cash flow estimates quoted market prices when available and independent appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value we derive the required cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans and apply an appropriate discount rate 

stockbased compensation 

stockbased compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period determining the fair value of stockbased awards at the grant date requires judgment including in the case of stock option awards estimating expected stock volatility in addition judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stockbased awards that are expected to be forfeited if actual results differ significantly from these estimates stockbased compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 

we have granted stock options to nonemployees which were subject to variable accounting when variable accounting is applied to stock option grants we remeasure the fair value of the unvested options at the end of each reporting period or until the options are cancelled or expire unexercised compensation expense in any given period is calculated as the difference between total earned compensation at the end of the period less total earned compensation at the beginning of the period both of which are based on the price of our common stock at such dates as a result fluctuations in the price of our common stock will change compensation expense recognized by us each reporting period 

we have also granted time and marketbased restricted stock awards to employees and nonemployees timebased and marketbased awards to nonemployees are subject to variable accounting for the timebased restricted stock grants to nonemployees we cumulatively remeasure the fair value at the end of every period based on the month end closing price of our common stock marketbased restricted stock awards vest based on the relative performance of our common stock to a composite index we calculate the fair value of marketbased restricted stock using a monte carlo simulation method which requires a substantial number of inputs and estimates of future market conditions and considers the range of various vesting probabilities as a result expense recorded for our nonemployee awards can fluctuate substantially from period to period 

income taxes 

we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method under which deferred income taxes are recognized for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at currently enacted statutory tax rates for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized our cumulative pretax loss in recent fiscal years represents sufficient evidence for us to determine that the establishment of a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset is appropriate this valuation allowance offsets deferred tax assets associated with future tax deductions as well as carryforward items 

our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof in addition our filed tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 

we recognize and measure uncertain tax positions and record tax benefits when it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

at each period end it is necessary for us to make certain estimates and assumptions to compute the provision for income taxes including allocations of certain transactions to different tax jurisdictions amounts of permanent and temporary differences the likelihood of deferred tax assets being recovered and the outcome of contingent tax risks these estimates and assumptions are revised as new events occur more experience is acquired and additional information is obtained the impact of these revisions is recorded in income tax expense or benefit in the period in which they become known 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

amendments to variable interest entity guidance 

on april 1 2010 the company adopted new guidance which requires an enterprise to determine whether its variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the enterprise that has both 1 the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impacts the entitys economic performance and 2 the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity the guidance also requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity the adoption of this new guidance did not have any impact on our consolidated financial position cash flows or results of operations 

multipledeliverable revenue arrangements 

in october 2009 new guidance was issued related to the accounting for multipledeliverable revenue arrangements these new rules amend the existing guidance for separating consideration in multipledeliverable arrangements and establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable these new rules will become effective on a prospective basis at the start of a companys first fiscal year beginning after june 15 2010 april 1 2011 for the company we do not expect the adoption of this new guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position cash flows or results of operations 

certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 

in october 2009 new guidance was issued that changes the accounting model for revenue arrangements by excluding tangible products containing both software and nonsoftware components that function together to deliver the products essential functionality this new rule will become effective on a prospective basis at the start of a companys first fiscal year beginning after june 15 2010 april 1 2011 for the company we do not expect the adoption of this new guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position cash flows or results of operations 

fluctuations in operating results and seasonality 

we have experienced fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results as a result of the timing of the introduction of new titles variations in sales of titles developed for particular platforms market acceptance of our titles development and promotional expenses relating to the introduction of new titles sequels or enhancements of existing titles projected and actual changes in platforms the timing and success of title introductions by our competitors product returns changes in pricing policies by us and our competitors the size and timing of acquisitions the timing of orders from major customers order cancellations and delays in product shipment sales of our products are also seasonal with peak shipments typically occurring in the fourth calendar quarter as a result of increased demand for titles during the holiday season quarterly and annual comparisons of operating results are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of net revenue represented by certain line items in our statements of operations net revenue by geographic region and net revenue by platform 



fiscal years ended march 31 2011 and 2010 



1 includes 10695 and 5213 of stockbased compensation expense in 2011 and 2010 respectively net revenue increased 3739 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 as compared to the prior year primarily due to the releases of red dead redemption in may 2010 and mafia ii in august 2010 and a periodoverperiod increase in our nba franchise partially offsetting the increase in net revenue were decreases in bioshock 2 and borderlands  which were released in february 2010 and october 2009 respectively and a decrease in sales of our grand theft auto franchise of approximately 635 million the decrease in our grand theft auto franchise was primarily due to decreases in sales from grand theft auto iv and grand theft auto chinatown wars as well as from downloadable episodes grand theft auto iv the lost and damned and grand theft auto the ballad of gay tony which released in prior periods partially offset by the current year release of grand theft auto iv complete  

net revenue on current generation consoles accounted for approximately 839 of our total net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 as compared to 749 for the prior year the increase is primarily due to releases of red dead redemption in may 2010 and mafia ii in august 2010 and a periodoverperiod increase in our nba franchise pc sales increased to approximately 93 of our total net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 as compared to 87 for the prior year primarily due to the september 2010 release of sid meiers civilization® v  handheld sales decreased to 46 of our total net revenue for the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 as compared to 103 for the prior year primarily due to a decrease in sales of grand theft auto chinatown wars  which released on the psp in october 2009 and the nintendo ds in march 2009 as well as the impact of the increased net revenue on current generation consoles for the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 mentioned above 

gross profit as a percentage of net revenue increased in 2011 compared to the prior year primarily due to improved pricing mix resulting from the release of red dead redemption in may 2010 and higher development royalties in the prior year primarily due to the october 2009 release of the externally developed borderlands  partially offset by higher internal royalty expense which was primarily due to increased income generated from red dead redemption 

net revenue earned outside of north america accounted for approximately 4457 million 392 for the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 as compared to 2521 million 330 in the prior year the increase was primarily due to the global release of red dead redemption in may 2010 while 2k sports titles which are mostly sold in north america made up a larger proportion of our net revenue during the fiscal year ended march 31 2010 foreign exchange rates decreased net revenue and gross profit by approximately 91 million and 11 million respectively for the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 as compared to the prior year 

operating expenses 



1 includes stockbased compensation expense as follows 



foreign currency exchange rates decreased total operating expenses by approximately 20 million in the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 as compared to the prior year 

selling and marketing 

selling and marketing expenses increased 218 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 as compared to the prior year primarily due to higher advertising expenses related to red dead redemption and mafia ii partially offset by lower advertising expenses incurred for the february 2010 release of bioshock 2  the october 2009 release of borderlands and the grand theft auto franchise 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses decreased 62 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 as compared to the prior year primarily due to reduced salary expense as a result of cost cutting initiatives 25 million of income as a result of a favorable legal settlement and 24 million of reduced stockbased compensation expense related to the stock options issued to zelnickmedia as they became fully vested in august 2010 the decrease was partially offset by higher performancebased incentive compensation as a result of the companys improved performance 

general and administrative expenses for the fiscal years ended march 31 2011 and 2010 include occupancy expense primarily rent utilities and office expenses of 143 million and 148 million respectively related to our development studios 

research and development 

research and development expenses increased 117 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 as compared to the prior year primarily due to lower payroll capitalization rates at our development studios due to the transition of efforts being refocused to new projects following the may 2010 release of red dead redemption and an increase in production expenses 

depreciation and amortization 

depreciation and amortization expenses decreased 14 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 as compared to the prior year primarily due to lower purchases of fixed assets during the current period 

interest and other net 



interest and other net was an expense of 135 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 as compared to an expense of 188 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2010 primarily due to a loss on the sale of our italian subsidiary during the fiscal year ended march 31 2010 and we recorded a greater foreign exchange gain for the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 partially offset by higher interest expense the increase in interest expense net is primarily due to higher average debt and interest rates for the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 

provision for income taxes 

income tax expense was 98 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 compared to 131 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2010 the tax in 2011 is due to increased income in the foreign jurisdictions while the 2010 tax expense related to an increase to our valuation allowance as a result of deferred tax liabilities related to goodwill and a tax expense resulting from the cancellation of stock options our effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to changes in valuation allowances and changes in gross unrecognized tax benefits during both the 2011 and 2010 periods our valuation allowances decreased by 152 million during the 2011 period primarily due to the use of net operating losses while our valuation allowance increased by 251 million during the same period in 2010 primarily due to taxable losses incurred during the period 

as of march 31 2011 we had gross unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties of 151 million all of which would affect our effective tax rate if realized for the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by 42 million primarily related to domestic tax issues we are generally no longer subject to audit for us federal income tax returns for periods prior to our fiscal year ended october 31 2007 and state income tax returns for periods prior to fiscal year ended october 31 2004 with few exceptions we are no longer subject to income tax examinations in nonus jurisdictions for years prior to fiscal year ended october 31 2005 us federal taxing authorities have completed examinations of our income tax returns through the fiscal years ended october 31 2006 and have recently informed us of their intent to audit subsequent years through fiscal year ending october 31 2009 certain us state taxing authorities are currently examining our income tax returns from fiscal years ended october 31 2004 through october 31 2006 in addition tax authorities in certain nonus jurisdictions are currently examining our income tax returns the determination as to further adjustments to our gross unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months is not practicable 

we are regularly audited by domestic and foreign taxing authorities audits may result in tax assessments in excess of amounts claimed and the payment of additional taxes we believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable tax assessments 

discontinued operations 

loss from discontinued operations net of income tax reflects the results of our former distribution business for which the net assets were sold in february 2010 for the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 the loss was 53 million as compared to a loss of 149 million for the prior year the loss during the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 is primarily due to costs associated with a net liability for a lease assumption without economic benefit the loss generated during the fiscal year ended march 31 2010 is primarily due 

to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets net of income tax and also reflected our active involvement in the distribution business at that time 

net income loss and earnings loss per share 

for the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 our net income was 485 million as compared to a net loss of 1230 million in the prior year earnings per share for the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 was 056 as compared to a net loss per share of 158 for the fiscal year ended march 31 2010 total weighted average shares outstanding for the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 increased compared to the prior year period primarily due to the inclusion of the dilutive impact of participating restricted stock for the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 and the vesting of restricted stock over the last twelve months 

fiscal years ended october 31 2009 and 2008 



1 includes 6094 and 13461 of stockbased compensation expense respectively 

net revenue decreased 5300 million for the fiscal year ended october 31 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to lower sales of grand theft auto iv released in april 2008 for the ps3 and xbox 360 sales of our grand theft auto franchise were 4168 million lower for the fiscal year ended october 31 2009 the decrease in sales from grand theft auto iv was partially mitigated by the 2009 releases of grand theft auto chinatown wars  grand theft auto episodes from liberty city as well as downloadable episodes grand theft auto iv the lost and damned and grand theft auto the ballad of gay tony 

excluding our grand theft auto franchise net revenue was lower by 1132 million primarily related to titles that were released in 2008 such as those in our midnight club  civilization  carnival games and bioshock franchises which collectively decreased 1280 million compared to the prior year partially offsetting the decrease in net revenues was the release of borderlands in october 2009 

net revenue generated by our 2k sports products decreased 171 million compared to the prior year mainly reflecting lower sales of our 2008 release top spin 3 partially offset by better performance of nba 2k10 compared to its predecessor title 

net revenue on current generation platforms accounted for approximately 674 of our total net revenue for the fiscal year ended october 31 2009 compared to 822 for the same period in 2008 the decrease is primarily due to the release of grand theft auto iv in april 2008 for the ps3 and xbox 360 pc software sales increased 379 million 921 due primarily to the first quarter 2009 pc release of grand theft auto iv  sales on prior generation platforms continued to decline led by a 482 decrease on ps2 reflecting wider acceptance of current generation platforms we expect volume on prior generation platforms to continue to decline as a result of the continued transition to current generation hardware platforms and have therefore reduced the number of titles in development for these older platforms we have also continued to reduce pricing on software titles for the ps2 as the current generation hardware installed base grows 

gross profit as a percentage of net revenue decreased for the fiscal year ended october 31 2009 as compared to the prior year which included the initial release period of grand theft auto iv one of our highest margin products product costs increased as a percentage of net revenue primarily due to volume based manufacturing discounts that were recorded in connection with our release of grand theft auto iv in the 2008 period additionally software development costs and royalties increased as a percentage of net revenue in 2009 as we incurred higher royalty costs associated with the increased number of externally developed titles released in 2009 primarily related to the october 2009 release of borderlands  also software development costs and royalties were negatively impacted by impairments related to our major league baseball titles partially offset by impairments recorded in 2008 internal royalties decreased from the prior year period primarily due to decreased sales and profitability in our publishing business and a change in the compensation structure at our rockstar games label where internal royalties were previously calculated using a net sales formula and are now calculated based on a profit share formula license costs increased as a percentage of net revenue as we are not expecting to generate the revenue necessary to exceed the minimum commitments due under our license agreements with major league baseball entities as a result we accelerated the amortization of certain license costs related to the contract and impaired development costs related to future titles additionally we offered greater price concessions in the 2009 period primarily due to the economic slowdown and increased pressure to reduce prices on certain titles 

revenue earned from licensing our intellectual property to thirdparties and other ancillary revenues decreased to 252 million for the fiscal year ended october 31 2009 compared to 332 million in 2008 primarily due to the october 2008 release of grand theft auto iv for the ps3 and xbox 360 in japan we recognize substantially higher gross profit margins on revenue earned in connection with licensing our products 

net revenue earned outside of north america accounted for approximately 2614 million 373 for the fiscal year ended october 31 2009 compared to 5356 million 435 in the 2008 period the yearoveryear decrease was primarily attributable to the release of grand theft auto iv in the second quarter of 2008 foreign exchange rates reduced net revenue and gross profit by approximately 288 million and 29 million respectively for the fiscal year ended october 31 2009 compared to the fiscal year ended october 31 2008 

operating expenses 



1 includes stockbased compensation expense as follows 



foreign currency exchange rates favorably impacted total operating expenses by approximately 144 million for the fiscal year ended october 31 2009 

selling and marketing 

selling and marketing expenses decreased 124 million for the fiscal year ended october 31 2009 as compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to a decrease of 68 million in advertising and marketing expense primarily related to the release of grand theft auto iv in april 2008 with no comparable product in the current year and a decrease of 43 million in personnel and severance costs due to lower incentive based compensation as well as savings from the restructuring and termination of employees in our european operations in december 2007 partially offset by a 09 million increase in personnel costs in asia due to expansion initiatives in the asiapacific region 

general and administrative 

general and administrative expenses decreased 359 million for the fiscal year ended october 31 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 primarily due to a decrease of 206 million in professional fees primarily due to a 70 million decrease in consulting expense related to stockbased compensation expense for stockbased awards to zelnickmedia reflecting a decrease in the price of our common stock and lower performancebased compensation consulting and legal fees related to the electronic arts tender offer also decreased by approximately 104 million and a decrease of 72 million in personnel costs due to lower incentive based compensation and cost saving initiatives initiated in 2008 

general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended october 31 2009 and 2008 also include occupancy expense primarily rent utilities and office expenses of 141 million and 118 million respectively related to our development studios 

research and development 

research and development expenses decreased slightly for the fiscal year ended october 31 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 personnel costs decreased primarily due to lower bonus expense and higher capitalization rates the capitalization rates for payroll related costs for 2008 were lower than usual as certain development studios refocused their efforts to new projects following the release of grand theft auto iv  this decrease was offset by higher production expenses and increased headcount primarily from the prior year acquisitions of rockstar new england formerly known as mad doc software llc and 2k czech formerly known as illusion softworks as as well as expansion initiatives in asiapacific markets 

depreciation and amortization 

for the fiscal year ended october 31 2009 depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by 37 million compared to 2008 primarily due to lower purchases of fixed assets during the current year period 

interest and other net 



for the fiscal year ended october 31 2009 interest and other net was an expense of 58 million compared to an expense of 33 million in the prior year period interest expense was significantly higher in the current year period primarily due to the issuance of our convertible notes in june 2009 as well as higher interest expense associated with our line of credit this expense was partially offset by favorable exchange gains in our foreign subsidiaries in addition lower interest income during the fiscal year ended october 31 2009 due to lower average cash balances and lower interest rates contributed to the increase in the net expense for the fiscal year ended october 31 2009 

provision for income taxes income tax expense was 45 million for the fiscal year ended october 31 2009 compared to 133 million for the fiscal year ended october 31 2008 the change in income taxes is primarily attributable to pretax losses without tax benefit in 2009 a reduction in our liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits following the conclusion of certain tax audits and a cumulative charge to increase our valuation allowance as a result of deferred tax liabilities related to goodwill which cannot be used to offset deferred tax assets compared to worldwide pretax income in 2008 with a related tax charge we did not record an income tax benefit on our pretax losses in 2009 due to uncertainty regarding the realization of our deferred tax assets and recorded income tax expense on income generated in several foreign jurisdictions our effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate due to losses without tax benefit in 2009 and changes in gross unrecognized tax benefits during 2009 and 2008 the 2009 taxable loss required an increase to the valuation allowance of 257 million while the use of net operating losses in 2008 enabled the reversal of the valuation allowance of 193 million 

as of october 31 2009 we had gross unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties of 246 million all of which would affect our effective tax rate if realized for the fiscal year ended october 31 2009 gross unrecognized tax benefits decreased by 18 million primarily related to adjustments resulting from tax audits that concluded during 2009 

us federal taxing authorities have completed examinations of our income tax returns for years through our fiscal year ended october 31 2002 certain us state taxing authorities are currently examining our income tax returns from fiscal years ended october 31 2004 through october 31 2006 in addition tax authorities in certain nonus jurisdictions are currently examining our tax returns it is possible that tax examinations will be settled prior to october 31 2010 based on the progress and possible settlement of certain audits we believe it is reasonably possible that approximately 110 million of our gross unrecognized tax benefits could become payable during the next 12 months we generally are no longer subject to audit for us federal income tax returns for periods prior to october 31 2003 and state income tax returns for periods prior to october 31 2004 with some exceptions we are generally no longer subject to income tax examinations in nonus jurisdictions for years prior to october 31 2005 

we are regularly audited by domestic and foreign taxing authorities audits may result in tax assessments in excess of amounts claimed and the payment of additional taxes we believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable tax assessments 

discontinued operations 

income loss from discontinued operations net of income tax reflects the results of our former distribution business for which net assets were sold in february 2010 for the fiscal year ended october 31 2009 the loss was 100 million as compared to income of 26 million for the same period last year the loss during the fiscal year ended october 31 2009 is primarily due to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets net of income tax related to the distribution business 

net loss income and earnings loss per share for the fiscal year ended october 31 2009 our net loss was 1405 million compared to net income of 971 million in the fiscal year ended october 31 2008 net loss per share for the fiscal year ended october 31 2009 was 183 compared to net income per share of 126 and 125 for basic and diluted earnings per share respectively for the fiscal year ended october 31 2008 weighted average shares outstanding decreased compared to the prior period primarily due to the inclusion of unvested sharebased awards that are considered participating restricted stock due to net income generated during the fiscal year ended october 31 2008 offset in part by the vesting of restricted stock awards during the fiscal year ended october 31 2009 

liquidity and capital resources 

our primary cash requirements have been to fund i the development manufacturing and marketing of our published products ii working capital iii acquisitions and iv capital expenditures we expect to 

rely on funds provided by our operating activities our credit agreement and our convertible notes to satisfy our working capital needs 

in february 2010 we completed the sale to synnex of our jack of all games thirdparty distribution business which primarily distributed thirdparty interactive entertainment software hardware and accessories in north america for approximately 440 million including 373 million in cash subject to purchase price adjustments and up to an additional 67 million subject to the achievement of certain items which were not met in april 2011 we settled on the purchase price adjustments and as a result the purchase price was lowered by 15 million consequently the net purchase price after the settlement was 358 million as of march 31 2011 we had recorded a liability of discontinued operations for 61 million primarily related to a lease assumption which matures on september 30 2014 and the purchase price adjustment owed to synnex 

in june 2009 we issued 1380 million aggregate principal amount of 4375 convertible senior notes due 2014 convertible notes interest on the convertible notes is payable semiannually on june 1 and december 1 of each year and commenced on december 1 2009 the convertible notes mature on june 1 2014 unless earlier redeemed or repurchased by the company or converted 

the convertible notes are convertible at an initial conversion rate of 936768 shares of our common stock per 1000 principal amount of convertible notes representing an initial conversion price of approximately 10675 per share of common stock for a total of approximately 12927000 underlying conversion shares subject to adjustment in certain circumstances holders may convert the convertible notes at their option prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding december 1 2013 only under the following circumstances 1 during any fiscal quarter commencing after july 31 2009 if the last reported sale price of the common stock for at least 20 trading days whether or not consecutive during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130 of the applicable conversion price on each applicable trading day 2 during the five business day period after any 10 consecutive trading day period the measurement period in which the trading price per 1000 principal amount of convertible notes for each day of that measurement period was less than 98 of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the applicable conversion rate on each such day 3 if we call the convertible notes for redemption at any time prior to the close of business on the third scheduled trading day prior to the redemption date or 4 upon the occurrence of specified corporate events on and after december 1 2013 until the close of business on the third scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date holders may convert their convertible notes at any time regardless of the foregoing circumstances upon conversion the convertible notes may be settled at our election in cash shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the companys common stock our common stock price exceeded 130 of the applicable conversion price of 10675 per share for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ended march 31 2011 accordingly as of april 1 2011 the notes may be converted at the holders option through june 30 2011 if the notes were to be converted during this period our current intent and ability given our option would be to settle the conversion in shares of our common stock as such we have continued to classify these convertible notes as longterm debt 

at any time on or after june 5 2012 the company may redeem all of the outstanding convertible notes for cash but only if the last reported sale of our common stock for 20 or more trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day prior to the date we provide notice of redemption to holders of the convertible notes exceeds 150 of the conversion price in effect on each such trading day the redemption price will equal 100 of the principal amount of the convertible notes to be redeemed plus all accrued and unpaid interest including additional interest if any to but excluding the redemption date the indenture governing the convertible notes contains customary terms and covenants and events of default as of march 31 2011 we were in compliance with all covenants and requirements outlined in the indenture governing the convertible notes 

in july 2007 we entered into a credit agreement which provides for borrowings of up to 1400 million and is secured by substantially all of our assets and the equity of our subsidiaries the credit agreement the credit agreement expires on july 3 2012 revolving loans under the credit agreement bear interest at our election of a 200 to 250 above a certain base rate with a minimum 600 base rate 800 at march 31 2011 and 2010 and october 31 2009 or b 325 to 375 above the libor rate with a minimum 400 libor rate 725 at march 31 2011 and 2010 and october 31 2009 we are also required to pay a monthly fee on the unused available balance ranging from 025 to 075 based on amounts borrowed 

availability under the credit agreement is restricted by our domestic and united kingdom based accounts receivable and inventory balances the credit agreement also allows for the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to 250 million 

as of march 31 2011 there were no outstanding borrowings and 1155 million was available to borrow we had 17 million of letters of credit outstanding at march 31 2011 

the credit agreement substantially limits us and our subsidiaries ability to create incur assume or be liable for indebtedness dispose of assets outside the ordinary course of business acquire merge or consolidate with or into another person or entity create incur or allow any lien on any of their respective properties make investments or pay dividends or make distributions each subject to certain limitations in addition the credit agreement provides for certain events of default such as nonpayment of principal and interest breaches of representations and warranties noncompliance with covenants acts of insolvency default on indebtedness held by thirdparties and default on certain material contracts subject to certain limitations and cure periods the credit agreement also contains a requirement that we maintain an interest coverage ratio of more than one to one for the trailing twelve month period if the liquidity of our domestic operations falls below 300 million including available borrowings under the credit facility based on a 30day average as of march 31 2011 we were in compliance with all covenants and requirements outlined in the credit agreement 

we are subject to credit risks particularly if any of our receivables represent a limited number of customers or are concentrated in foreign markets if we are unable to collect our accounts receivable as they become due it could adversely affect our liquidity and working capital position 

generally we have been able to collect our accounts receivable in the ordinary course of business we do not hold any collateral to secure payment from customers we have trade credit insurance on the majority of our customers to mitigate accounts receivable risk 

a majority of our trade receivables are derived from sales to major retailers and distributors our five largest customers accounted for 438 598 564 and 404 of net revenue for the fiscal years ended march 31 2011 and 2010 and the fiscal years ended october 31 2009 and 2008 respectively as of march 31 2011 and 2010 and october 31 2009 amounts due from our five largest customers comprised approximately 542 657 and 597 of our gross accounts receivable balance respectively with our significant customers those that individually comprised more than 10 of our gross accounts receivable balance accounting for 382 561 and 503 of such balance at march 31 2011 and 2010 and october 31 2009 respectively we believe that the receivable balances from these largest customers do not represent a significant credit risk based on past collection experience although we actively monitor each customers credit worthiness and economic conditions that may impact our customers business and access to capital we are monitoring the current global economic conditions including credit markets and other factors as it relates to our customers in order to manage the risk of uncollectible accounts receivable 

we have entered into various agreements in the ordinary course of business that require substantial cash commitments over the next several years generally these include 

• agreements to acquire licenses to intellectual property such as trademarks copyrights and technology for use in the publishing marketing and distribution of our software titles our licensing and marketing commitments primarily reflect agreements with major sports leagues and players associations and expire at various times through september 2014 47 

• contractual payments to thirdparty software developers that expire at various times through april 2012 guaranteed minimum payments assume satisfactory performance and • operating leases primarily related to occupancy furniture and equipment expiring at various times through december 2017 a summary of annual minimum contractual obligations and commitments as of march 31 2011 is as follows in thousands of dollars 



in addition to the cash commitments above we have also entered into acquisition agreements that contain provisions for us to pay contingent cash consideration typically contingent on the acquired company achieving certain financial unit sales or performance conditions the amount and timing of these payments are currently not fixed or determinable see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of our potential acquisition commitments 

income taxes at march 31 2011 the company had recorded a liability for gross unrecognized tax benefits of 120 million for which we are unable to make a reasonable and reliable estimate of the period in which these liabilities will be settled with the respective tax authorities therefore these liabilities have not been included in the contractual obligations table see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we believe our current cash and cash equivalents and projected cash flow from operations along with availability under our credit agreement will provide us with sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash requirements for working capital capital expenditures and commitments through at least the next 12 months 

our changes in cash flows are as follows 



at march 31 2011 we had 2804 million of cash and cash equivalents compared to 1458 million at march 31 2010 our increase in cash and cash equivalents from march 31 2010 was primarily due to cash 

from operating activities generated from the strong performance of games released during the year primarily red dead redemption  nba 2k11 and mafia ii  

cash and cash equivalents were positively impacted by 66 million during the year ended march 31 2011 as a result of foreign currency exchange movements 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of march 31 2011 and 2010 and october 31 2009 we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial parties such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes that have or are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operation liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

international operations 

net revenue earned outside of the united states is principally generated by our operations in europe canada australia and asia for the fiscal years ended march 31 2011 and 2010 and the fiscal years ended october 31 2009 and 2008 approximately 441 393 422 and 491 respectively of our net revenue was earned outside of the united states we are subject to risks inherent in foreign trade including increased credit risks tariffs and duties fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates shipping delays and international political regulatory and economic developments all of which can have a significant impact on our operating results 

fluctuations in quarterly operating results and seasonality 

we have experienced fluctuations in quarterly operating results as a result of the timing of the introduction of new titles variations in sales of titles developed for particular platforms market acceptance of our titles development and promotional expenses relating to the introduction of new titles sequels or enhancements of existing titles projected and actual changes in platforms the timing and success of title introductions by our competitors product returns changes in pricing policies by us and our competitors the accuracy of retailers forecasts of consumer demand the size and timing of acquisitions the timing of orders from major customers and order cancellations and delays in product shipment sales of our titles are also seasonal with peak shipments typically occurring in the fourth calendar quarter as a result of increased demand for titles during the holiday season quarterly comparisons of operating results are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

market risk is the potential loss arising from fluctuations in market rates and prices our market risk exposures primarily include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

interest rate risk 

historically fluctuations in interest rates have not had a significant impact on our operating results under our credit agreement outstanding balances bear interest at our election of a 200 to 250 above a certain base rate with a minimum 600 base rate 800 at march 31 2011 or b 325 to 375 above the libor rate with a minimum 400 libor rate 725 at march 31 2011 with the margin rate subject to the achievement of certain average liquidity levels changes in market rates may impact our future interest expense if there is an outstanding balance on our line of credit the convertible notes pay interest semiannually at a fixed rate of 4375 per annum and we expect that there will be no fluctuation related to the convertible notes impacting our cash component of interest expense for additional details on our convertible notes see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

we transact business in foreign currencies and are exposed to risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates accounts relating to foreign operations are translated into united states dollars using prevailing exchange rates at the relevant period end translation adjustments are included as a separate component of stockholders equity for the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 our foreign currency translation gain adjustment was approximately 142 million we recognized a foreign exchange transaction gain in interest and other net in our consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended march 31 2011 and october 31 2009 of 14 million and 43 million respectively and a foreign exchange transaction loss for the fiscal years ended march 31 2010 and october 31 2008 of 06 million and 50 million respectively 

we use forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk related to certain foreign currency transactions these transactions primarily relate to nonfunctional currency denominated cash balances and intercompany funding loans nonfunctional currency denominated accounts receivable and nonfunctional currency denominated accounts payable we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes at march 31 2011 we had forward contracts outstanding to purchase 24 million of foreign currency in exchange for us dollars and 355 million of us dollars in exchange for foreign currencies with a maturity of less than one year for the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 we recorded a 69 million loss related to foreign currency forward contracts in interest and other net on the consolidated statements of operations 

for the fiscal year ended march 31 2011 441 of the companys revenue was generated outside the united states using sensitivity analysis a hypothetical 10 increase in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would decrease revenues by 44 while a hypothetical 10 decrease in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would increase revenues by 44 in the opinion of management a substantial portion of this fluctuation would be offset by cost of goods sold and operating expenses incurred in local currency
