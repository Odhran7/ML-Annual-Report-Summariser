covid19 impact the novel coronavirus covid19 pandemic together with the measures implemented or recommended by governmental authorities and private organizations in response to the pandemic has had an adverse impact that has been material to the companys business operating results financial condition and liquidity the company has seen increasing demand for travel both domestically and in countries where entry is permitted compared to demand at the start of the covid19 pandemic however as the situation surrounding the covid19 pandemic remains fluid the pandemic has 

continued to negatively impact travel demand it remains difficult to reasonably assess or predict the full extent of the ongoing impact of the covid19 pandemic on the companys longerterm operational and financial performance which will depend on a number of future developments many of which are outside the companys control such as the ultimate duration of and factors impacting the recovery from the pandemic including the efficacy and speed of vaccination programs in curbing the spread of the virus in different markets the efficacy and availability of various treatment options the introduction and spread of new variants of the virus that may be resistant to currently approved vaccines or treatment options and the continuation of existing or implementation of new government travel restrictions customer behavior changes and fluctuations in demand for air travel among others the covid19 pandemic and the measures taken in response may continue to impact many aspects of our business operating results financial condition and liquidity in a number of ways including labor shortages including reductions in available staffing and related impacts to the companys flight schedules and reputation facility closures and related costs disruptions to the companys and its business partners operations reduced travel demand and consumer spending increased operating costs supply chain disruptions logistics constraints volatility in the price of our securities our ability to access capital markets and volatility in the global economy and financial markets generally the companys recovery from the covid19 pandemic has not followed a linear path and due to the significant uncertainty that remains its future operating performance particularly in the shortterm may be subject to volatility the company is taking steps to be prepared for recovery as demand for travel continues to generally increase which include investing in innovative technology focusing on process improvements and implementing the united next transformative strategy during 2021 the company operated approximately 63 of its 2019 capacity

aircraft fuel the table below summarizes the fuel consumption and expense of uals aircraft including the operations of our regional partners operating under cpas during the last three years 



our operational and financial results can be significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel the company routinely enters into purchase contracts based on expected fuel requirements for ual aircraft including regional partners operating under cpas that are generally indexed to various market price benchmarks for aircraft fuel these contracts customarily do not provide material protection against changes in market prices or guarantee the uninterrupted availability of adequate quantities of aircraft fuel the price of aircraft fuel used by our operations has fluctuated substantially in the past several years the companys current strategy is to not enter into financial transactions to hedge the market price exposure of its expected fuel consumption although the company regularly reviews its strategy based on market conditions and other factors due to the partial recovery in operations experienced in 2021 our aircraft fuel consumption has increased from 2020 levels 

industry conditions 

domestic competition the domestic airline industry is highly competitive and dynamic the companys competitors consist primarily of other airlines and to a certain extent other forms of transportation currently any us carrier deemed fit by the us department of transportation the dot is largely free to operate scheduled passenger service between any two points within the united states competition can be direct in the form of another carrier flying the exact nonstop route or indirect where a carrier serves the same two cities nonstop from an alternative airport in that city or via an itinerary requiring a connection at another airport air carriers cost structures are not uniform and are influenced by numerous factors carriers with lower costs may offer lower fares to passengers which could have a potential negative impact on the companys revenues domestic pricing decisions are impacted by intense competitive pressure exerted on the company by other us airlines in order to remain competitive and maintain passenger traffic levels we often find it necessary to match competitors discounted fares since we compete in a dynamic marketplace attempts to generate additional revenue through increased fares often fail 

international competition internationally the company competes not only with us airlines but also with foreign carriers international competition has increased and may continue to increase in the future as a result of airline mergers and acquisitions jbas alliances restructurings liberalization of aviation bilateral agreements and new or increased service by competitors competition on international routes is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation the companys ability to compete successfully with nonus carriers on international routes depends in part on its ability to generate traffic to and from the entire united states via its integrated domestic route network and its ability to overcome business and operational challenges across its network worldwide foreign carriers currently are prohibited by us law from carrying local passengers between two points in the united states and the company generally experiences comparable restrictions in foreign countries separately fifth freedom rights allow the company to operate between points in two different foreign countries and foreign carriers may also have fifth freedom rights between the us and another foreign country in the absence of fifth freedom rights or some other extrabilateral right to conduct operations between two foreign countries us carriers are constrained from carrying passengers to points beyond designated international gateway cities to compensate partially for these structural limitations us and foreign carriers have entered into alliances immunized jbas and marketing arrangements that enable these carriers to exchange traffic between each others flights and route networks through these arrangements the company strives to provide consumers with a growing number of seamless costeffective and convenient travel options see alliances above for additional information 

seasonality the air travel business is subject to seasonal fluctuations historically demand for air travel is higher in the second and third quarters driving higher revenues than in the first and fourth quarters which are periods of lower travel demand 

environmental social and governance approach and highlights 

climate strategy 

the companys commitment to operating an environmentally sustainable and responsible airline is woven into its longterm strategy and its values the company believes that it is critical now more than ever to continue to enhance its services connecting people and uniting the world and is committed to finding solutions both individually as a company and together with partners in both the private and public sectors to do so sustainably and responsibly while also achieving its financial goals the company is continuously looking for new ways to reduce its environmental impact in the air on the ground and at its facilities which benefits its employees customers and stockholders at the end of 2020 the company pledged to become 100 green by eliminating its greenhouse gas ghg emissions by 2050 without relying on the use of traditional carbon offsets the only airline globally to make this commitment given the airline industrys designation as a hardtoabate sector the company believes that not relying on carbon offsets is important and the right priority because the airline industry should focus on real decarbonization within its own activities as the industry cannot afford to divert resources and attention toward offset programs that do not effectuate real progress within aviation operations 

since making the announcement of the companys pledge to become 100 green by eliminating ghg emissions by 2050 management has identified multiple pathways to accomplish this goal wholly independent of any current regulatory requirement to do so the companys earnest intention on meeting the net zero ghg emission goal led the company to commit to a midterm objective of reducing compared to 2019 its carbon intensity by 50 by 2035 this carbon intensity target aligns with the temperature limits of the paris agreement and will allow the company to show progress towards its 2050 net zero ghg emissions goal in the nearer term 

even with the challenges presented by the covid19 pandemic the company is committed to redefining the future of air travel with environmental sustainability in the forefront because it believes that it is the companys responsibility to take tangible steps to mitigate climate change its strategy to achieve its climate goals is centered around four key pathways each of which is described in further detail below i reducing the companys environmental footprint ii innovating for potentially transformative carbon reduction technology iii removing the companys atmospheric carbon impacts and iv collaborating with employees customers airports suppliers crossindustry partners and policymakers to facilitate faster action and the commercialization of technology solutions concerning climate change the companys board of directors the board including through its public responsibility committee provides oversight of its climate goals and strategy to ensure integration with its core business strategy and management periodically updates the board on the implementation of the companys climate strategy 

• reducing environmental footprint  as part of this plan the company is keyed on maximizing fuel efficiency and reducing fuel usage in its operations the main focus in realizing this objective is reducing its fossil jet fuel consumption which is both the largest contributor to its environmental footprint and a sizable expense for the company the companys primary effort in reducing its fossil jet fuel consumption is directed on working with strategic partners to employ and commercialize the use of sustainable aviation fuel saf saf is the only technology solution realized today that can abate emissions from the companys flight operations saf can reduce lifecycle ghg emissions by up to 85 compared with conventional jet fuel and has the added benefits of having a limited impact on performance or safety and providing energy diversification however saf supply in the jet fuel market is constrained today with it contributing to far less than 1 of global commercial aviation fuel usage additionally the purchase of saf today comes with a price premium compared to conventional jet fuel to account for the additional costs of this earlystage solution these challenges with presentday saf have informed the companys strategy of investing in saf producers and technology to help scale the saf market and unlock future supply for the company the company uses saf from world energy in its daily operations at lax and has sourced more than five million gallons of saf since 2016 

◦ in 2015 the company made a 30 million equity investment in fulcrum bioenergy inc fulcrum a company that has developed a process for transforming municipal solid waste into low carbon transportation fuels and entered into a longterm supply agreement with fulcrum which provides united the opportunity to purchase at least 900 million gallons of saf

◦ in december 2021 the company made aviation history by operating the first passenger flight using 100 saf in one engine from chicago to washington dc the flight showcased the safety of saf and the potential for a dramatically reduced carbon footprint for aviation 

alongside developing and using saf the company is concentrated on introducing newer more fuelefficient aircraft into its fleet as well as improving the efficiency of its existing fleet from 1990 to 2021 the company improved its mainline fuel efficiency more than 30 in the second quarter of 2021 the company announced united next and entered into firm narrowbody aircraft orders for 200 boeing 737 max aircraft and 70 airbus a321neo aircraft which are expected to have an 11 overall improvement in fuel efficiency and an expected 1720 lower carbon emission per seat compared to older planes in conjunction with its saf mission and improving the fuel efficiency of its fleet the company has been revamping its flight and ground operations implementing operational and procedural initiatives to drive fuel conservation over 4000 units of the companys ground service equipment gse around the world are electric or use alternative fuels and as of the end of 2021 nearly 32 of its gse fleet have been electrified the company has worked collaboratively across its organization and with air traffic control atc providers to improve fuel efficiency through the implementation of best practices by providing training to its pilots and dispatchers and supplying them with the tools needed to execute on those strategies 

• innovating in carbon reduction technology  the company has been forming partnerships with as well as investing in earlystage climate technology companies that have the potential to scale and support the companys climate targets or are generally supportive of advancing sustainability within the broader economy in june 2021 the company launched a new corporate venture capital fund united airlines ventures ltd uav to focus the companys efforts in these investments

◦ in december 2021 the company became the largest airline to invest in zeroemission engines for regional aircraft with a new equity stake in hydrogenelectric engine developer zeroavia inc these engines support the retrofit of select regional aircraft engines replacing fossil fuel burning engines with zeroemission alternatives 

• removing carbon impact  the company intends to extend its environmental sustainability efforts beyond reducing emissions by also focusing on carbon removal by investing in carbon capture technologies to either sequester carbon or to potentially utilize captured carbon to make lowcarbon fuels in 2020 the company became the first airline to announce a commitment to invest in direct air capture a carbon capture and sequestration technology 

• collaborating with partners  the company has devoted a significant amount of time and energy on defining a better future of flying by collaborating with employees customers airports suppliers crossindustry partners and policymakers to scale the supply of decarbonization technology solutions minimize its environmental impact boost environmental sustainability of the airline industry and protect the environment all of which are key to advancing the companys climate goals 

◦ the company worked with federal policymakers to champion the sustainable skies act saf blenders tax credit with the intent to create an economic incentive for increased saf production within the united states 

◦ the company is a founding member of the biden administrations first movers coalition a collective of leading companies committing to purchase lowcarbon technologies in hardtoabate sectors as part of its membership the company has committed to using emerging technologies with significant emissions reductions by 2030 and has also set a target of replacing at least 5 of conventional jet fuel demand with saf that reduces lifecycle ghg emissions by 85 or more compared with conventional jet fuel by 2030 

◦ at the international level the company was the only airline whose chief executive officer attended the 2021 un conference of the parties cop26 climate conference supporting the pathway to netzero emissions for air travel through the use of saf and other technologies 

◦ during the cop26 conference the sustainable aviation buyers alliance saba a nonprofit initiative of the environmental defense fund and rocky mountain institute that is developing a sustainability framework for saf announced that united and other airlines have founded its new aviators group through saba the company intends to work collaboratively with its customers and industry peers to support lowcarbon technologies such as saf

additional quantitative emissions data follows this paragraph the company believes that its absolute ghg emissions will rise in the immediate future as the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the companys operations lessens and the company implements its united next strategy and expects to return to growth with the anticipated increase in travel demand in addition even though investing in carbon offsets could present nearterm emissions reductions as outlined above the company is resolute in attaining its midterm and longterm climate goals without relying on the use of traditional carbon offsets and has made progress towards implementing solutions that are needed to permanently change aviation and reduce the environmental impact of air travel to protect our planet for generations to come it is also important to note that certain of these technology solutions need time to reach commercial availability despite this and other hurdles the company believes that its investment in these solutions are sound particularly given that the companys climate goals and overall climate strategy are increasingly important factors in its relationships with its employees and customers

industry regulation 

airlines are subject to extensive domestic and international regulatory oversight the following discussion summarizes the principal elements of the regulatory framework applicable to our business regulatory requirements including but not limited to those discussed below affect our operations and increase our operating costs and future regulatory developments may continue to do the same in the future in addition should any of our governmental authorizations or certificates be modified suspended or revoked our business and competitive position could be materially adversely affected see part i item 1a risk factors— the airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation which imposes significant costs and may adversely impact our business operating results and financial condition  for additional information on the material effects of compliance with government regulations 

domestic regulation all carriers engaged in air transportation in the united states are subject to regulation by the dot absent an exemption no air carrier may provide air transportation of passengers or property without first being issued a dot certificate of public convenience and necessity the dot also grants international route authority approves international codeshare arrangements and regulates methods of competition the dot regulates consumer protection and maintains jurisdiction over advertising denied boarding compensation tarmac delays baggage liability and other areas and may add additional expensive regulatory burdens in the future the dot has launched investigations or claimed rulemaking authority to regulate commercial agreements among carriers or between carriers and third parties in a wide variety of contexts 

airlines are also regulated by the federal aviation administration the faa an agency within the dot primarily in the areas of flight safety air carrier operations and aircraft maintenance and airworthiness the faa issues air carrier operating certificates and aircraft airworthiness certificates prescribes maintenance procedures oversees airport operations and regulates pilot and other employee training from time to time the faa issues directives that require air carriers to inspect modify or ground aircraft and other equipment potentially causing the company to incur substantial unplanned expenses the airline industry is also subject to numerous other federal laws and regulations the us department of homeland security dhs 

has jurisdiction over virtually every aspect of civil aviation security the antitrust division of the us department of justice doj has jurisdiction over certain airline competition matters the us postal service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail by airlines labor relations in the airline industry are generally governed by the rla a federal statute the company is also subject to investigation inquiries by the dot faa doj dhs the us food and drug administration fda the us department of agriculture usda centers for disease control and prevention cdc osha and other us and international regulatory bodies 

airport access access to landing and takeoff rights or slots at several major us airports served by the company are subject to government regulation federallymandated domestic slot restrictions that limit operations and regulate capacity currently apply at three airports reagan national airport in washington dc and john f kennedy international airport and laguardia airport in the new york city metropolitan region additional restrictions on takeoff and landing slots at these and other airports may be implemented in the future and could affect the companys rights of ownership and transfer as well as its operations 

legislation  the airline industry is subject to legislative actions or inactions that may have an impact on operations and costs in 2018 the us congress approved a fiveyear reauthorization for the faa which encompasses significant aviation tax and policyrelated issues the law includes a range of policy changes related to airline customer service and aviation safety implementation of some items continues and depending on how they are implemented could impact our operations and costs us congressional action in response to the covid19 pandemic has provided funding for us airlines in both grants and loans the us congress has imposed limited conditions on airlines accepting funding including workforce retention and minimum service requirements with the current us congress and presidential administration any future funding or other pandemic relief could include additional requirements that could impact our operations and costs additionally the us congress may consider legislation related to environmental issues or increases to the us federal corporate income tax rate which could impact the company and the airline industry 

international regulation international air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation in connection with the companys international services the company is regulated by both the us government and the governments of the foreign countries or regions the company serves in addition the availability of international routes to us carriers is regulated by aviation agreements between the us and foreign governments and in some cases fares and schedules require the approval of the dot andor the relevant foreign governments 

legislation foreign countries are increasingly enacting passenger protection laws rules and regulations that meet or exceed us requirements in cases where this activity exceeds us requirements additional burden and liability may be placed on the company certain countries have regulations requiring passenger compensation from the company andor enforcement penalties in addition to changes in operating procedures due to overbooked canceled or delayed flights 

airport access historically access to foreign routes has been tightly controlled through bilateral agreements between the us and each foreign jurisdiction involved these agreements regulate the routes served the number of carriers allowed to serve each route and the frequency of carriers flights since the early 1990s the us has pursued a policy of open skies meaning all us and foreign carriers have access to the destination under which the us government has negotiated a number of bilateral agreements allowing unrestricted access between us and foreign points currently there are more than 100 open skies agreements in effect however even with open skies many of the airports that the company serves in africa the middle east asiapacific europe and latin america maintain slot controls a large number of these slot controls exist due to congestion environmental and noise protection and reduced capacity due to runway and atc construction work among other reasons 

the companys ability to serve some foreign routes and expand into certain others is limited by the absence of aviation agreements between the us government and the relevant foreign governments shifts in us or foreign government aviation policies may lead to the alteration or termination of air service agreements depending on the nature of any such change the value of the companys international route authorities and slot rights may be materially enhanced or diminished similarly foreign governments control their airspace and can restrict our ability to overfly their territory which may enhance or diminish the value of the companys existing international route authorizations and slot rights 

the covid19 pandemic has caused many governments to restrict entry to foreign nationals with some exceptions andor to impose multiple health management rules which can include covid19 vaccinations boosters testing quarantine upon arrival health declarations and temperature screens among others such requirements have resulted in reduced demand for travel in certain circumstances and have caused the company to suspend some international service certain foreign governments have granted waivers for limited periods that allow the company to maintain existing slot rights and route authorizations while not operating at a particular foreign point the airline industry is advocating for the continuation of such waivers until the operating and demand environment return to normal but future waivers are not guaranteed 

environmental regulation  the airline industry is subject to increasingly stringent federal state local and international environmental regulations including those regulating emissions to air water discharges safe drinking water and the use and management of hazardous substances and wastes the company endeavors to comply with all applicable environmental regulations 

climate change  as outlined above the companys commitment to becoming a more environmentally sustainable company extends beyond seeking to comply with regulatory requirements at the same time efforts to reduce carbon emissions through environmental sustainability legislation and regulation or nonbinding standards or accords is an increased focus of global national and regional regulators a policy to regulate ghg emissions from aviation known as the european union eu emission trading system ets was adopted in 2009 but applicability to flights arriving at or departing from airports outside the eu has been postponed several times in december 2017 the european parliament voted to extend exemptions for extraeu flights until december 2023 in order to align with the completion of the pilot phase of the international civil aviation organizations icao carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation corsia more recently the european parliament released its fit for 55 proposals to revise and update eu legislation in line with a goal of reducing ghg emissions 55 by 2030 including provisions purporting to implement corsia through the eu ets the current proposals if adopted could require airlines to comply with duplicative requirements under both eu ets and corsia for intraeu international flights corsia which was adopted in october 2016 is intended to create a single global marketbased measure to achieve carbonneutral growth for international aviation through airline purchases of eligible carbon offset credits and the use of eligible sustainable fuels the unprecedented nature of the covid19 pandemic prompted icao to include only 2019 emissions as opposed to the originally planned average of 201920 emissions as the baseline upon which offsetting obligations would be calculated for the pilot phase 202123 of the scheme the applicable baseline for the subsequent phases of the scheme however is still uncertain the icao assembly will review corsia in 2022 and this review will include the impact of covid19 on the scheme including the changed baseline to 2019 certain corsia program aspects could potentially be affected by the results of the pilot phase of the program and thus the impact of corsia cannot be fully predicted domestically in december 2020 the us environmental protection agency epa adopted its own aircraft and aircraft engine ghg emissions standards which are aligned with the 2017 icao airplane co2 emission standards but the us government has recently indicated that it will seek more ambitious aircraft co2 standards within icao additionally in november 2021 the faa released the us aviation climate action plan which indicates the administration will be assessing policy measures for domestic aviation ghg emissions which could include similar requirements to corsia to purchase offsets for domestic flights 

the company believes that policies that incentivize the production of saf such as a blenders tax credit or economywide carbon prices or taxes would enable the company to decarbonize its operations more cost efficiently than a patchwork of regulatory requirements on aviation particularly those that require airlines to reduce flights or impose the cost of transitioning to lowcarbon alternatives disproportionately on airlines the company is working with policymakers to adopt policies that incentivize the production of saf to allow the industry to transition to a lower carbon future in addition while the company is resolute in attaining its midterm and longterm climate goals without relying on voluntary use of traditional carbon offsets the company may be subject to future regulatory requirements that require the purchase of carbon offsets which may expose the company to additional costs associated with the procurement of offsets or limited supply in the carbon offsets market 

other regulations  our operations are subject to a variety of other environmental laws and regulations both in the united states and internationally these include noiserelated restrictions on aircraft types and operating times and state and local air quality initiatives which have resulted or could in the future result in curtailments in services increased operating costs limits on expansion or further emission reduction requirements certain airports andor governments both domestically and internationally either have established or are seeking to establish environmental fees and other requirements applicable to carbon emissions local air quality pollutants andor noise the implementation of these requirements is expected to result in restrictions on mobile sources of air pollutants such as cars trucks and airport ground support equipment in corresponding locations 

various states have passed legislation restricting the use of class b firefighting foam agents that contain intentionally added per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas which are expected to require the company to continue to incur costs to convert existing fixed foam fire suppression systems to accommodate pfasfree firefighting foam agents in addition the epa has developed a comprehensive strategic plan for pfas regulatory actions across a wide spectrum of its statutory authorities including the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the resource conservation and recovery act the clean water act the toxic substances control act and the safe drinking water act the company expects these broad regulatory policies will impact its operations that currently have or historically used firefighting foam agents containing pfas to mitigate these risks the company is working to remove pfascontaining firefighting foam from its hangars through a phased retrofit strategy and is committed to transitioning to pfasfree materials for fire suppression finally environmental cleanup laws could require the company to undertake or subject the company to liability for investigation and remediation costs at certain owned or leased locations or thirdparty disposal locations because certain 

pfas are expected to be regulated under cercla and other environmental cleanup laws the company may become subject to potential liability for its historic usage of pfascontaining materials although such potential liability is not expected to be significant until the applicability of new regulations to our specific operations is better defined andor until pending regulations are finalized future costs to comply with such regulations will remain uncertain but are likely to increase our operating costs over time 

while the company is required to comply with numerous applicable environmental regulations the company believes that these regulations and programs including the pilot phase of corsia epa regulations regarding pfas and ghg emissions and other existing environmental regulations is not reasonably likely to have a material effect on the companys results or competitive position however the precise nature of future requirements and their applicability to the company are difficult to predict and the financial impact to the company and the aviation industry could be significant

 item 1a risk factors 

any of the risks and uncertainties described below could significantly and negatively affect our business operations financial condition operating results including components of our financial results cash flows prospects reputation or credit ratings which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline significantly additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or risks that we currently consider immaterial could also impair our business operations financial condition operating results cash flows prospects reputation or credit ratings 

covid19 pandemic risks 

the covid19 pandemic has materially and adversely impacted our business operating results financial condition and liquidity the full extent of the impact will depend on future developments and how quickly we can return to more normal operations among other things if the impacts from the covid19 pandemic extend beyond our assumed timelines our actual results may vary significantly from our expectations 

the covid19 pandemic prompted governments and businesses to take unprecedented measures in response that have included international and domestic travel restrictions or advisories restrictions on business operations limitations on public gatherings social distancing recommendations temporary closures of businesses remote work arrangements closures of tourist destinations and attractions as well as quarantine and shelterinplace orders as a result we experienced a precipitous decline in passenger demand and bookings for both business and leisure travel which has had an adverse impact that has been material to the companys business operating results financial condition and liquidity and has materially disrupted our strategic operating plans the company has seen increasing demand for travel both domestically and internationally however as the situation surrounding the covid19 pandemic remains fluid the pandemic has continued to negatively impact travel demand it remains difficult to reasonably predict the full extent of the ongoing impact of the covid19 pandemic on the companys longerterm operational and financial performance which will depend on a number of future developments many of which are outside the companys control such as the ultimate duration of and factors impacting the recovery from the pandemic including the efficacy and speed of vaccination programs in curbing the spread of the virus in different markets the efficacy and availability of various treatment options the introduction and spread of new variants of the virus that may be resistant to currently approved vaccines or treatment options and the continuation of existing or implementation of new government travel restrictions the volatility of aircraft fuel prices customer behavior changes and fluctuations in demand for air travel among others the covid19 pandemic and the measures taken in response may continue to impact many aspects of our business operating results financial condition and liquidity in a number of ways including labor shortages including reductions in available staffing and related impacts to the companys flight schedules and reputation facility closures and related costs and disruptions to the companys and its business partners operations reduced travel demand and consumer spending increased fuel and other operating costs including due to inflation supply chain disruptions logistics constraints volatility in the price of our securities our ability to access capital markets and volatility in the global economy and financial markets generally if the negative impacts from the covid19 pandemic extend beyond our assumed timelines our actual results may vary significantly from our expectations 

in addition the outbreak and spread of the covid19 pandemic have adversely impacted customer perceptions of the health safety ease and predictability of air travel and these negative perceptions could continue even after the pandemic subsides actual or perceived risk of infection on our flights at airports and during other travelrelated activities has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the publics perception of air travel which has harmed and may continue to harm our reputation and brand and result in reduced demand for the companys flights or the flights of its codeshare partners or regional carriers we have incurred and expect that we will continue to incur covid19related costs as we sanitize aircraft implement additional hygienerelated protocols and take other actions to limit the threat of infection among our employees and passengers and combat negative customer perceptions of the health and safety of travel on our aircraft and at our terminals 

our level of indebtedness has increased as we managed through the effects of the covid19 pandemic and may continue to increase as a result of the companys various financing activities in response to the pandemic the company is subjected to more substantial risk of default crossdefault and crossacceleration in the event of breach of its covenants under such financings for example under certain of the companys credit card processing agreements with financial institutions the financial institutions in certain circumstances have the right to require that the company maintain certain cash or other collateral reserves related to advance ticket sales the covid19 pandemic has resulted in an increase in demand from consumers for refunds on their tickets and if increased demand for refunds continues we are at risk of triggering liquidity covenants in these processing agreements if such covenants were triggered it could force us to post cash collateral in addition under the terms of certain assistance received by the company under the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the cares act and related legislation the companys business is subject to certain restrictions including requirements to maintain certain levels of scheduled service moreover the company may plan to seek additional liquidity in the nearterm and the companys ability to obtain additional financing is subject to certain limitations including covenants in several of the 

companys debt agreements that limit its ability to incur additional indebtedness in addition the terms of any additional financing may subject the company to additional covenants limiting its operational and financial flexibility 

we as well as our partners are facing and could continue to face potential other negative consequences stemming from the covid19 pandemic including but not limited to increased cyber threats such as phishing social engineering and malware attacks partly due to the increase in remote work arrangements supply chain constraints and an increasingly competitive labor market due to an industrywide sustained labor shortage including for skilled labor if a regional carrier supplier third party vendor or service provider were unable to timely provide adequate products or support for its products including aircraft or otherwise fulfill its commitments to the company the companys operations could be materially adversely affected 

it is possible that covid19 could exacerbate any of the other risks described in this form 10k as well at this time we cannot predict the full extent of the negative impact that the covid19 pandemic will have on our business operating results financial condition and liquidity 

strategic and business development risks 

we may not be successful in executing elements of our strategic operating plan which may have a material adverse impact on our business financial results and market capitalization 

in june 2021 the company announced its united next plan including firm orders of 270 aircraft retrofitting plans and plans to increase mainline daily departures and available seats across the companys north american network in developing our united next plan we made certain assumptions including but not limited to those related to the duration and scope of the continued impacts from the covid19 pandemic customer demand delivery of aircraft potential labor and supply chain shortages inflation rates voluntary or mandatory groundings of aircraft our regional network competition market consolidation and other macroeconomic and geopolitical factors actual conditions may be different from our assumptions and could cause the company to adjust its strategic operating plan in addition we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to successfully execute our strategic plan our strategic plan will not result in additional unanticipated costs the growth that we anticipate will occur through execution of our strategic plan will not exacerbate any other risk described in this form 10k especially relating to our supply chain or our ability to attract train and retain talent our partners will timely provide adequate products or support for our products including delivery of aircraft or our strategic plan will result in improvements in future financial performance if we do not successfully execute our united next or other strategic plans or if actual results vary significantly from our expectations our business operating results financial condition and market capitalization could be materially and adversely impacted the failure to successfully structure our business to meet market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

changes in the companys network strategy over time or other factors outside of the companys control may make aircraft on order less economic for the company result in costs related to modification or termination of aircraft orders or cause the company to enter into orders for new aircraft on less favorable terms and any inability to accept or integrate new aircraft into the companys fleet as planned could increase costs or affect the companys flight schedules 

the companys orders for new aircraft are typically made years in advance of actual delivery of such aircraft and the financial commitment required for purchases of new aircraft is substantial as a result of our network strategy changing or our demand expectations not being realized our preference for the aircraft that we previously ordered may decrease however the company may be responsible for material liabilities to its counterparties if it were to attempt to modify or terminate any of its existing aircraft order commitments and our financial condition could be adversely impacted these risks are heightened as a result of the companys united next order in the second quarter of 2021 which was the largest order in the companys history additionally the company may have a need for additional aircraft that are not available under its existing orders and may seek to acquire aircraft from other sources such as through lease arrangements which may result in higher costs or less favorable terms or through the purchase or lease of used aircraft the company may not be able to acquire such aircraft when needed on favorable terms or at all 

furthermore if for any reason the company is unable to accept deliveries of new aircraft or integrate such new aircraft into its fleet as planned the company may face higher financing and operating costs than planned or be required to seek extensions of the terms for certain leased aircraft or otherwise delay the exit of other aircraft from its fleet such unanticipated extensions or delays may require the company to operate existing aircraft beyond the point at which it is economically optimal to retire them resulting in increased maintenance costs or reductions to the companys schedule thereby reducing revenues 

the imposition of new tariffs or any increase in existing tariffs on the importation of commercial aircraft that the company orders may also result in higher costs 

failure to effectively manage acquisitions divestitures investments joint ventures and other portfolio actions could adversely impact our operating results in addition any businesses or assets that we acquire in the future may underperform 

although we are committed to reducing our debt over the long term an important part of the companys strategy to expand its global network has included making significant investments both domestically and in other parts of the world including in other airlines and other aviation industry participants producers of sustainable aviation fuel and manufacturers of electric and other new generation aircraft the company plans to continue to make additional investments through its corporate venture capital arm uav however increased competition in forming and maintaining relationships with other airlines since there are a limited number of potential arrangements and other airlines and industry participants seek to enter into similar relationships may make it difficult for the company to complete strategic investments on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

future revenues profits and cash flows of these and future investments and repayment of invested or loaned funds may not materialize due to safety concerns regulatory issues supply chain problems or other factors beyond our control where we acquire debt or equity securities as all or part of the consideration for business development activities such as in connection with a joint venture the value of those securities will fluctuate and may depreciate in value we may not control the companies in which we make investments and as a result we will have limited ability to determine its management operational decisions internal controls and compliance and other policies which can result in additional financial and reputational risks 

from time to time we also divest assets we may not be successful in separating any such assets and losses on the divestiture of or lost operating income from such assets may adversely affect our earnings any divestitures also may result in continued financial exposure to the divested businesses following the transaction such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements or potential litigation 

in addition we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce our earnings for example in 2020 united recorded a full credit loss allowance against the 515 million carrying value of the brw term loan as defined in note 8 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report and related receivable moreover new or revised accounting standards rules and interpretations could result in changes to the recognition of income and expense that may materially and adversely affect our financial results 

if the execution or implementation of acquisitions divestitures investments joint ventures and other portfolio actions is not successful it could adversely impact our financial condition cash flows and results of operations in addition due to the companys substantial amount of debt there can be no assurance of when we will be able to expand our business development capacity pursuing these opportunities may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing and could result in increased leverage andor a downgrade of our credit ratings 

business operational and industry risks 

the company could experience adverse publicity harm to its brand reduced travel demand potential tort liability and operational restrictions as a result of an accident catastrophe or incident involving its aircraft or its operations or the aircraft or operations of another airline which may result in a material adverse effect on the companys business operating results or financial condition 

an accident catastrophe or incident involving an aircraft that the company operates or an aircraft or aircraft type that is operated by another airline or an incident involving the companys operations or the operations of another airline could have a material adverse effect on the company if such accident catastrophe or incident created a public perception that the companys operations or the operations of its codeshare partners or regional carriers are not safe or reliable or are less safe or reliable than other airlines further any such accident catastrophe or incident involving the company its regional carriers or its codeshare partners could expose the company to significant liability although the company currently maintains liability insurance in amounts and of the type the company believes to be consistent with industry practice to cover damages arising from any such accident catastrophe or incident and the companys codeshare partners and regional carriers carry similar insurance and generally indemnify the company for their operations if the companys liability exceeds the applicable policy limits or the ability of another carrier to indemnify it the company could incur substantial losses from an accident catastrophe or incident which may result in a material adverse effect on the companys business operating results or financial condition in addition any such accident catastrophe or incident involving the company its regional carriers or its codeshare partners could result in operational restrictions on the company including voluntary or mandatory groundings of aircraft voluntary or involuntary groundings have also impacted and could in the future impact the companys financial results and operations in numerous ways including reduced revenue redistributions of other aircraft and deferrals of capital expenditure and other spending a prolonged period of time operating a reduced fleet in these circumstances could result in a material adverse effect on the companys business operating results or financial condition for example the company decided to voluntarily ground its boeing 737 aircraft following certain electrical issues and in february 2021 the faa issued an emergency airworthiness 

directive regarding certain boeing 777 pratt  whitney powered aircraft the grounding of the boeing 777 pratt  whitney powered aircraft and boeing 737 aircraft has adversely affected our business and could adversely affect our business going forward if their return to service is significantly delayed 

the global airline industry is highly competitive and susceptible to price discounting and changes in capacity which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

the airline industry is highly competitive marked by significant competition with respect to routes fares schedules both timing and frequency services products customer service and frequent flyer programs consolidation in the airline industry the rise of wellfunded government sponsored international carriers changes in international alliances swaps of landing and slots and the creation of immunized jbas have altered and are expected to continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with increased financial resources more extensive global networks and services and competitive cost structures open skies agreements including the longstanding agreements between the united states and each of the eu canada japan korea new zealand australia colombia and panama as well as the more recent agreements between the united states and each of mexico and brazil may also give rise to better integration opportunities among international carriers movement of airlines between current global airline alliances could reduce joint network coverage for members of such alliances while also creating opportunities for jbas and bilateral alliances that did not exist before such realignment further airline and airline alliance consolidations or reorganizations could occur in the future and other airlines participating in such activities may significantly improve their cost structures or revenue generation capabilities thereby potentially making them stronger competitors of the company and impairing the companys ability to realize expected benefits from its own strategic relationships 

airlines also compete by increasing or decreasing their capacity including route systems and the number of destinations served several of the companys domestic and international competitors have increased their international capacity by including service to some destinations that the company currently serves causing overlap in destinations served and therefore increasing competition for those destinations this increased competition in both domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on the companys business operating results and financial condition 

the companys us operations are subject to competition from traditional network carriers national pointtopoint carriers and discount carriers including lowcost carriers and ultralowcost carriers that may have lower costs and provide service at lower fares to destinations also served by the company the significant presence of lowcost carriers and ultralowcost carriers which engage in substantial price discounting may diminish our ability to achieve sustained profitability on domestic and international routes and has also caused us to reduce fares for certain routes resulting in lower yields on many domestic markets our ability to compete in the domestic market effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure if we cannot maintain our costs at a competitive level then our business operating results and financial condition could continue to be materially and adversely affected in addition our competitors have established new routes and destinations including some at our hub airports in light of the expansion opportunities presented by the covid19 pandemic which may compete with our existing routes and destinations and expansion plans 

our international operations are subject to competition from both foreign and domestic carriers for instance competition is significant from governmentsubsidized competitors from certain middle east countries these carriers have large numbers of international widebody aircraft on order and are increasing service to the us from their hubs in the middle east the government support provided to these carriers has allowed them to grow quickly reinvest in their product invest in other airlines and expand their global presence we also face competition from foreign carriers operating under fifth freedom rights permitted under international treaties that allow certain carriers to provide service to and from stopover points between their home countries and ultimate destinations including points in the united states in competition with service provided by us 

through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers us carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation such as services to and beyond traditional global gateway cities similarly foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior us passenger traffic beyond traditional us gateway cities through these relationships in addition several jbas among us and foreign carriers have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules pricing sales and inventory if we are not able to continue participating in these types of alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements in the future our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

our mileageplus frequent flyer program benefits from the attractiveness and competitiveness of united airlines as a material purchaser of award miles and the majority recipient for mileage redemption if we are not able to maintain a competitive and attractive airline business our ability to acquire engage and retain customers in the loyalty program may be adversely affected which could adversely affect the loyalty programs and our operating results and financial condition 

further our mileageplus frequent flyer program also faces significant and increasing direct competition from the frequent flyer programs offered by other airlines as well as from similar loyalty programs offered by banks and other financial services companies competition among loyalty programs is intense regarding customer acquisition incentives the value and utility of program currency rewards range and value fees required usage and other terms and conditions of these programs if we are not able to maintain a competitive frequent flyer program our ability to attract and retain customers to mileageplus and united alike may be adversely affected which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

substantially all of the companys aircraft engines and certain parts are sourced from a limited number of suppliers therefore the company would be materially and adversely affected if it were unable to obtain timely deliveries additional equipment or support from any of these suppliers 

the company currently sources substantially all of its aircraft and many related aircraft parts from the boeing company boeing or airbus sas airbus in addition our aircraft suppliers are dependent on other suppliers for certain other aircraft parts therefore if the company is unable to acquire additional aircraft at acceptable prices from boeing or airbus or if boeing or airbus fails to make timely deliveries of aircraft whether as a result of any failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval or certification for new model aircraft such as the 737 max 10 aircraft which has not yet been certified or manufacturing delays or otherwise or to provide adequate support for its products including with respect to the aircraft subject to firm orders under our united next plan the companys operations could be materially and adversely affected the company is also dependent on a limited number of suppliers for engines and certain other aircraft parts and could therefore also be materially and adversely affected in the event of the unavailability or increased cost of these engines and other aircraft parts 

disruptions to our regional network and united express flights provided by thirdparty regional carriers could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

while the company has contractual relationships that are material to its business with various regional carriers to provide regional aircraft service branded as united express that include contractually agreed performance metrics each regional carrier is a separately certificated commercial air carrier and the company does not control the operations of these carriers a number of factors may impact the companys regional network including weatherrelated effects seasonality equipment or software failures and cybersecurity attacks and any significant declines in demand for air travel services including as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

in addition the decrease in qualified pilots driven primarily by changes to federal regulations has adversely impacted and could continue to affect the companys regional flying for example the faas expansion of minimum pilot qualification standards including a requirement that a pilot have at least 1500 total flight hours as well as the faas revised pilot flight and duty time requirements under part 117 of the federal aviation regulations have contributed to a smaller supply of pilots available to regional carriers the decrease in qualified pilots resulting from the regulations as well as other factors including a decreased student pilot population and a shrinking us military from which to hire qualified pilots has led to increased competition from large mainline carriers attempting to meet their hiring needs and has adversely impacted our regional carriers our regional partners have been unable to hire adequate numbers of pilots to meet their needs resulting in a reduction in the number of flights offered disruptions in scheduled flights increased costs of operations financial difficulties and other adverse effects and these circumstances may become more severe in the future and thereby cause a material adverse effect on our business in response the company has been and may in the future be required to provide additional financial compensation and other support to its regional carriers or reduce its regional carrier flying which could require the company to fly routes at a greater cost reduce the number of destinations the company is able to serve or lead to negative public perceptions of the company 

disruptions to our regional networks as a result of the covid19 pandemic pilot shortage or other factors could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

unfavorable economic and political conditions in the united states and globally may have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

the companys business and operating results are significantly impacted by us and global economic and political conditions the airline industry is highly cyclical and the level of demand for air travel is correlated to the strength of the us and global economies robust demand for the companys air transportation services depends largely on favorable economic conditions including the strength of the domestic and foreign economies low unemployment levels strong consumer confidence levels and the availability of consumer and business credit air transportation is often a discretionary purchase that leisure travelers may limit or eliminate during difficult economic times shorthaul travelers in particular have the option to replace air travel with surface travel in addition during periods of unfavorable economic conditions business travelers historically have reduced the volume of their travel either due to costsaving initiatives the replacement of travel with alternatives such as videoconferencing or as a result of decreased business activity requiring travel in addition an increase in price levels generally or in price levels in a particular sector such as current inflation related to domestic and global supply chain issues which has 

led to both overall price increases and pronounced price increases in certain sectors could result in a shift in consumer demand away from both leisure and business travel during such periods the companys business and operating results have been and may in the future be adversely affected significant declines in industry passenger demand particularly with respect to the companys business and premium cabin travelers and a reduction in fare levels could lead to a material reduction in revenue changes to the companys operations and deferrals of capital expenditure and other spending additionally any deterioration in global trade relations such as increased tariffs or other trade barriers could result in a decrease in the demand for international air travel 

the companys business relies extensively on thirdparty service providers including certain technology providers failure of these parties to perform as expected or interruptions in the companys relationships with these providers or their provision of services to the company could have a material adverse effect on the companys business operating results and financial condition 

the company has engaged thirdparty service providers to perform a large number of functions that are integral to its business including regional operations operation of customer service call centers distribution and sale of airline seat inventory provision of information technology infrastructure and services transmitting or uploading of data provision of aircraft maintenance and repairs provision of various utilities and performance of airport ground services aircraft fueling operations and catering services among other vital functions and services although generally the company enters into agreements that define expected service performance and compliance requirements there can be no assurance that our thirdparty service providers will adhere to these requirements accordingly any of these thirdparty service providers may materially fail to meet its service performance commitments to the company or may suffer disruptions to its systems that could impact its services for example failures in certain thirdparty technology or communications systems may cause flight delays or cancellations the failure of any of the companys thirdparty service providers to perform their service obligations adequately or other interruptions of services may reduce the companys revenues and increase its expenses prevent the company from operating its flights and providing other services to its customers or result in adverse publicity or harm to our brand we may also be subject to consequences from any illegal conduct of our thirdparty service providers including for their failure to comply with anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act in addition the companys business and financial performance could be materially harmed if its customers believe that its services are unreliable or unsatisfactory 

the company may also have disagreements with such providers or such contracts may be terminated or may not be extended or renewed for example the number of flight reservations booked through thirdparty gdss or otas may be adversely affected by disruptions in the business relationships between the company and these suppliers such disruptions including a failure to agree upon acceptable contract terms when contracts expire or otherwise become subject to renegotiation may cause the companys flight information to be limited or unavailable for display by the affected gds or ota operator significantly increase fees for both the company and gdsota users and impair the companys relationships with its customers and travel agencies any such disruptions or contract terminations may adversely impact our operations and financial results 

if we are not able to negotiate or renew agreements with thirdparty service providers or if we renew existing agreements on less favorable terms our operations and financial results may be adversely affected 

extended interruptions or disruptions in service at major airports where we operate could have a material adverse impact on our operations and space facility and infrastructure constraints at our hubs or other airports may prevent the company from maintaining existing service andor implementing new service in a commercially viable manner 

the airline industry is heavily dependent on business models that concentrate operations in major airports in the united states and throughout the world an extended interruption or disruption at one of our hubs or other airports where we have a significant presence resulting from atc delays weather conditions natural disasters growth constraints relations with thirdparty service providers failure of computer systems disruptions to government agencies or personnel including as a result of government shutdowns disruptions at airport facilities or other key facilities used by us to manage our operations labor relations power supplies fuel supplies terrorist activities international hostilities or otherwise could result in the cancellation or delay of a significant portion of our flights and as a result could have a material impact on our business operating results and financial condition we have a significant portion of our maintenance operations at our sfo airport hub and any disruption or interruption at our sfo hub could have a serious impact on our overall operations we have minimal control over the operation quality or maintenance of these services or whether vendors will improve or continue to provide services that are essential to our business 

in addition as airports around the world become more congested space facility and infrastructure constraints at our hubs or other airports may prevent the company from maintaining existing service andor implementing new service in a commercially viable manner because of a number of factors including capital improvements at such airports being imposed by the relevant airport authority without the companys approval capital spending projects of airport authorities currently underway and 

additional projects that we expect to commence over the next several years is expected to result in increased costs to airlines and the traveling public that use those facilities as the airports seek to recover their investments through increased rental landing and other facility costs these actions have caused and may continue to cause the company to experience increased space rental rates at various airports in its network including a number of our hubs and gateways and increased operating costs furthermore the company is not able to control decisions by other airlines to reduce their capacity causing certain fixed airport costs to be allocated among fewer total flights and resulting in increased landing fees and other costs for the company 

geopolitical conflict terrorist attacks or security events may adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

as a global business with operations outside of the united states from which it derives significant operating revenues volatile conditions in certain international regions may have a negative impact on the companys operating results and its ability to achieve its business objectives the companys international operations are a vital part of its worldwide airline network political disruptions and instability in certain regions have negatively impacted the demand and network availability for air travel as well as fuel prices and may continue to have a negative impact on these and other items terrorist attacks or international hostilities even if not made on or targeted directly at the airline industry or the fear of or the precautions taken in anticipation of such attacks including elevated national threat warnings travel restrictions selective cancellation or redirection of flights and new security regulations could materially and adversely affect the company and the airline industry the companys financial resources and insurance coverage may not be sufficient to absorb the adverse effects of any future terrorist attacks international hostilities or other security events which could have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition liquidity and operating results in addition due to threats against the aviation industry the company has incurred and may continue to incur significant expenditures to comply with securityrelated requirements to mitigate threats and protect the safety of our employees and customers 

any damage to our reputation or brand image could adversely affect our business or financial results 

we operate in a publicfacing industry and maintaining a good reputation is critical to our business the companys reputation or brand image could be adversely impacted by any failure to maintain satisfactory practices for all of our operations and activities any failure to achieve andor make progress toward our environmental and sustainability goals or our diversity equity and inclusion goals public pressure from investors or policy groups to change our policies customer perceptions of our advertising campaigns sponsorship arrangements or marketing programs or customer perceptions of statements made by us our employees and executives agents or other third parties damage to our reputation or brand image or loss of customer confidence in our services could adversely affect our business and financial results as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation 

information technology cybersecurity and data privacy risks 

the company relies heavily on technology and automated systems to operate its business and any significant failure or disruption of or failure to effectively integrate and implement these technologies or systems could materially harm its business 

the company depends on technology and automated systems to operate its business including but not limited to computerized airline reservation systems electronic tickets electronic airport kiosks demand prediction software flight operations systems inflight wireless internet cloudbased technologies technical and business operations systems and commercial websites and applications including wwwunitedcom and the united airlines mobile app these systems could suffer substantial or repeated disruptions due to various events some of which are beyond the companys control including natural disasters power failures terrorist attacks dependencies on thirdparty technology services equipment or software failures cybersecurity attacks or other security breaches and the deployment by certain wireless carriers of new 5g service networks which could reduce the attractiveness of the companys services versus those of our competitors materially impair our ability to market our services and operate our flights result in the unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public subject us to liability to third parties regulatory action or contract termination and result in other increased costs lost revenue and the loss or compromise of important data as a result substantial or repeated systems failures or disruptions may adversely affect the companys business operating results and financial condition we have resiliency initiatives and disaster recovery plans in place to prevent and mitigate disruptions and we continue to invest in improvements to these initiatives and plans we also maintain property and business interruption insurance however these measures may not be adequate to prevent or mitigate disruptions or provide coverage for all of the companys associated costs 

the company may also face challenges in implementing integrating and modifying the automated systems and technology required to operate its business which may require significant expenditures human resources the development of effective 

internal controls and the transformation of business and financial processes if the company is unable to timely or effectively implement integrate or modify its systems and technology the companys operations could be adversely affected  

increasing privacy and data security obligations or a significant data breach may adversely affect the companys business 

in our regular business operations we collect process store and transmit to commercial partners sensitive data including personal information of our customers and employees such as payment processing information and information of our business partners to provide our services and operate our business 

the company must manage increasing legislative regulatory and consumer focus on privacy issues data security and cybersecurity risk management in a variety of jurisdictions across the globe for example the eus general data protection regulation imposes significant privacy and data security requirements as well as potential for substantial penalties for noncompliance that have resulted in substantial adverse financial consequences to noncompliant companies also some of the companys commercial partners such as credit card companies have imposed data security standards that the company must meet the company will continue its efforts to meet its privacy data security and cybersecurity risk management obligations however it is possible that certain new obligations or customer expectations may be difficult to meet and could require changes in the companys operating processes and increase the companys costs 

additionally the company must manage the increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks our network systems and storage applications and those systems and applications maintained by our thirdparty commercial partners such as credit card companies our regional carriers and international airline partners may be subject to attempts to gain unauthorized access breach malfeasance or other system disruptions including those involving criminal hackers denial of service attacks hacktivists statesponsored actors corporate espionage employee malfeasance and human or technological error in some cases it is difficult to anticipate or to detect immediately such incidents and the damage caused thereby in addition as attacks by cybercriminals become more sophisticated frequent and intense the costs of proactive defense measures have increased and may continue to increase in addition several large organizations recently have been affected by ransomware attacks and these highly publicized events may embolden individuals or groups to target our systems or the third party systems on which we rely furthermore the companys remote work arrangements make it more vulnerable to targeted activity from cybercriminals and significantly increase the risk of cyberattacks or other security breaches while we continually work to safeguard our network systems and applications including through risk assessments system monitoring cybersecurity and data protection security policies processes and technologies and employee awareness and training and require thirdparty security standards there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyberattacks or data breaches 

any such cyberattacks or data breaches could result in significant costs including monetary damages operational impacts including service interruptions and delays and reputational harm furthermore the loss disclosure misappropriation of or access to sensitive company information customers employees or business partners information or the companys failure to meet its privacy obligations could result in legal claims or proceedings penalties and remediation costs a significant data breach or the companys failure to meet its obligations may adversely affect the companys operations reputation relationships with our business partners business operating results and financial condition 

increased use of social media platforms present risks and challenges 

we are increasing our use of social media to communicate company news and events the inappropriate andor unauthorized use of certain media vehicles could cause brand damage or information leakage or could lead to legal implications including from the improper collection andor dissemination of personally identifiable information from employees customers or other stakeholders in addition negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us on any social networking website could damage our reputation brand image and goodwill further the disclosure of nonpublic companysensitive information by our workforce or others whether intentional or unintentional through external media channels could lead to information loss 

human capital management risks 

union disputes employee strikes or slowdowns and other laborrelated disruptions could adversely affect the companys operations and could result in increased costs that impair its financial performance 

united is a highly unionized company as of december 31 2021 the company and its subsidiaries had approximately 84100 employees of whom approximately 85 were represented by various us labor organizations see part i item 1 business—human capital management and resources of this report for additional information on our represented employee groups and collective bargaining agreements there is a risk that unions or individual employees might pursue judicial or arbitral claims arising out of changes implemented as a result of the company entering into collective bargaining agreements with its represented employee groups there is also a possibility that employees or unions could engage in job actions such as slowdowns worktorule campaigns sickouts or other actions designed to disrupt the companys normal operations in an 

attempt to pressure the company in collective bargaining negotiations although the rla makes such actions unlawful until the parties have been lawfully released to selfhelp and the company can seek injunctive relief against premature selfhelp such actions can cause significant harm even if ultimately enjoined similarly if the operations of our thirdparty regional carriers ground handlers or other vendors are impacted by laborrelated disruptions our operations could be adversely affected in addition collective bargaining agreements with the companys represented employee groups increase the companys labor costs and such costs could become material 

if we are unable to attract train or retain skilled personnel including our senior management team or other key employees our business could be adversely affected 

much of our future success is largely dependent on our continued ability to attract train and retain skilled personnel with industry experience and knowledge including our senior management team and other key employees competition for qualified talent in the aviation industry is intense especially during the covid19 pandemic and the tight labor markets have led to operational challenges that we expect to continue during 2022 if we are unable to attract train and retain talented highly qualified employees or experience a shortage of skilled labor the cost of hiring and retaining quality talent could materially increase and our operations could continue to be impacted which could impair our ability to adjust capacity or otherwise execute our strategic operating plan in addition if we are unable to effectively provide for the succession of senior management or other key employees our business ability to execute our strategic operating plan or company culture may be adversely affected 

regulatory tax litigation and legal compliance risks 

the airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation which imposes significant costs and may adversely impact our business operating results and financial condition 

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal oversight compliance with us and international regulations imposes significant costs and may have adverse effects on the company 

united provides air transportation under certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by the dot if the dot modified suspended or revoked these certificates it could have a material adverse effect on the companys business the dot also regulates consumer protection and through its investigations or rulemaking authority including for example any rulemakings or initiatives in response to the executive order on promoting competition in the american economy issued by the president on july 9 2021 could impose restrictions that materially impact the companys business united also operates pursuant to an air carrier operating certificate issued by the faa and faa orders and directives have previously resulted in the temporary grounding of an entire aircraft type when the faa identifies design manufacturing maintenance or other issues requiring immediate corrective action including the faa emergency airworthiness directive grounding our boeing 777 pratt  whitney powered aircraft which has had an effect that has been material to the companys business operating results and financial condition 

in 2018 the us congress approved a fiveyear reauthorization for the faa which encompasses a range of policy issues related to aviation tax airline customer service and aviation safety depending on how the issues are implemented our operations and costs could be materially impacted additionally the us congress may consider legislation related to environmental issues or increases to the us federal corporate income tax rate as outlined in the proposed build back better act or otherwise which could negatively impact the company and the airline industry 

the companys operations may also be adversely impacted due to the existing antiquated atc system utilized by the us government and regulated by the faa which may not be able to effectively handle projected future air traffic growth the outdated atc system has led to shortterm capacity constraints imposed by government agencies and has resulted in delays and disruptions of air traffic during peak travel periods in certain markets due to its inability to handle demand and reduced resiliency in the event of a failure causing flight cancellations and delays failure to update the atc system in a timely manner and the substantial funding requirements of a modernized atc system that may be imposed on air carriers may have an adverse impact on the companys financial condition or operating results 

access to slots at several major us airports and many foreign airports served by the company is subject to government regulation on airspace management and competition that might limit the number of slots or change the rules on the use and transfer of slots if slots are eliminated at one of our hubs or other airports or if the number of hours of operation governed by slots is reduced at an airport the lack of controls on takeoffs and landings could result in greater congestion both at the affected airport and in the regional airspace and could significantly impact the companys operations similarly a government or regulatory agency including dot could choose to impose slots at one of our hubs or other airports or grant increased access to another carrier and limit or reduce our operations at an airport whether or not slotcontrolled which could have significant impact on our operations the dot including faa may limit the companys airport access by limiting the number of 

departure and arrival slots at congested airports which could affect the companys ownership and transfer rights and local airport authorities may have the ability to control access to certain facilities or the cost to access their facilities which could have an adverse effect on the companys business if the dot were to take actions that adversely affect the companys slot holdings the company could incur substantial costs to preserve its slots or may lose slots 

the company currently operates a number of flights on international routes under government arrangements regulations or policies that designate the number of carriers permitted to operate on such routes the capacity of the carriers providing services on such routes the airports at which carriers may operate international flights or the number of carriers allowed access to particular airports applicable arrangements between the united states and foreign governments such as open skies may be amended from time to time government policies with respect to airport operations may be revised and the availability of appropriate slots or facilities may change which could have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition and operating results and could result in the impairment of material amounts of related tangible and intangible assets for instance the covid19 pandemic has resulted in increased regulatory burdens in the us and around the globe which include closure of international borders to flights andor passengers from specific countries passenger and crew quarantine requirements and other regulations promulgated to protect public health but that have had and may continue to have a negative impact on travel and airline operations 

in addition disruptions to the companys business could result from the deployment by certain wireless carriers of new 5g cellular networks which due to potential interference with aircraft systems could cause flights to be cancelled or diverted which in turn could affect consumer perceptions of the safety of air travel thus far regulators have addressed potential 5g interference on a temporary and piecemeal basis tailored to specific aircraft and airports and uncertainty over the nature extent timing and duration of limitations on aircraft operations as a result of 5g deployment is anticipated to continue over the near term systematic regulation of 5g cellular networks may not occur in the near term or may not involve terms that are favorable to the company 

in addition competition from revenuesharing jbas and other alliance arrangements by and among other airlines could impair the value of the companys business and assets on the open skies routes the companys plans to enter into or expand us antitrust immunized alliances and jbas on various international routes are subject to receipt of approvals from applicable us federal authorities and other applicable foreign government clearances or satisfaction of other applicable regulatory requirements there can be no assurance that such approvals and clearances will be granted or will continue in effect upon further regulatory review or that changes in regulatory requirements or standards can be satisfied 

see part i item 1 business—industry regulation of this report for additional information on government regulation impacting the company 

current or future litigation and regulatory actions or failure to comply with the terms of any settlement order or agreement relating to these actions could have a material adverse impact on the company 

from time to time we are subject to litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings relating to our business or investigations or other actions by governmental agencies including as described in part i item 3 legal proceedings of this report in addition the company is subject to an increased risk of litigation and other proceedings as a result of the covid19 pandemic and responsive measures for example the company is involved in litigation relating to its vaccination requirements for employees no assurances can be given that the results of these or new matters will be favorable to us an adverse resolution of lawsuits arbitrations investigations or other proceedings or actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results including as a result of nonmonetary remedies and could also result in adverse publicity defending ourselves in these matters may be timeconsuming expensive and disruptive to normal business operations and may result in significant expense and a diversion of managements time and attention from the operation of our business which could impede our ability to achieve our business objectives additionally any amount that we may be required to pay to satisfy a judgment settlement fine or penalty may not be covered by insurance if we fail to comply with the terms contained in any settlement order or agreement with a governmental authority relating to these matters we could be subject to criminal or civil penalties which could have a material adverse impact on the company under our charter and certain indemnification agreements that we have entered into and may in the future enter into with our officers directors and certain third parties we could be required to indemnify and advance expenses to them in connection with their involvement in certain actions suits investigations and other proceedings any of these payments may be material 

we are subject to many forms of environmental regulation and liability and risks associated with climate change and may incur substantial costs as a result in addition failure to achieve or demonstrate progress towards our climate goals may expose us to liability and reputational harm 

many aspects of the companys operations are subject to increasingly stringent federal state local and international laws protecting the environment including those relating to water discharges safe drinking water and the use and management of 

hazardous materials and wastes compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures and operational changes and violations can lead to significant fines and penalties and reputational harm in addition from time to time we are identified as a responsible party for environmental investigation and remediation costs under applicable environmental laws due to the disposal of hazardous substances generated by our operations we could also be subject to environmental liability claims from various parties including airport authorities and other third parties related to our operations at our owned or leased premises or the offsite disposal of waste generated at our facilities 

as discussed in part i item 1 business—environmental social and governance approach and highlights—climate strategy the company has made several commitments regarding its intended reduction of carbon emissions including becoming 100 green by eliminating its ghg emissions by 2050 and by reducing its carbon intensity by 50 by 2035 compared to 2019 the company has incurred and expects to continue to incur costs to achieve its goal of net zero carbon emissions and to comply with environmental sustainability legislation and regulation and nonbinding standards and accords such activity may require the company to modify its supply chain practices make capital investments to modify certain aspects of its operations or increase its operating costs including fuel costs the precise nature of future binding or nonbinding legislation regulation standards and accords which is an increased focus of global national and regional regulators is difficult to predict and the financial impact to the company would likely be significant if future legal standards do not align with the companys plans to achieve its climate goals or if proposed us legislation to accelerate the production of saf development fails to be enacted into law for instance corsiarelated costs cannot be fully predicted at this time but the program is expected to increase operating costs for airlines that operate internationally there is also a risk that the increased regulatory focus on airline ghg emissions could result in a patchwork of inconsistent or conflicting regional requirements that could unduly shift excessive cost burden to airlines and inhibit the development of carbon reduction technologies that the company needs to reach its climate goals 

there can be no assurance of the extent to which any of our climate goals will be achieved or that any future investments that we make in furtherance of achieving our climate goals will produce the expected results or meet increasing stakeholder environmental social and governance expectations moreover future events could lead the company to prioritize other nearerterm interests over progressing toward our current climate goals based on business strategy economic regulatory and social factors business strategy or potential pressure from investors activist groups or other stakeholders if we are unable to meet or properly report on our progress toward achieving our climate change goals and commitments we could face adverse publicity and reactions from other investors activist groups or other stakeholders which could result in reputational harm or other adverse effects to the company 

the company is likely to incur substantial costs and operational disruptions as a result of increases in the frequency severity or duration of severe weather events caused by climate change including thunderstorms hurricanes flooding typhoons tornados and other severe weather events that could result in increases in delays and cancellations turbulencerelated injuries and fuel consumption to avoid such weather any of which could result in significant loss of revenue and higher costs in addition we could incur significant costs to improve the climate resiliency of our infrastructure and supply chain and otherwise prepare for respond to and mitigate the effects of climate change we are not able to predict accurately the materiality of any potential losses or costs associated with the effects of climate change

market liquidity accounting and financial risks 

high andor volatile fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a material adverse impact on the companys strategic plans operating results financial condition and liquidity 

aircraft fuel is critical to the companys operations and is one of our largest operating expenses during the year ended december 31 2021 the companys fuel expense was approximately 58 billion the timely and adequate supply of fuel to meet operational demand depends on the continued availability of reliable fuel supply sources as well as related service and delivery infrastructure although the company has some ability to cover shortterm fuel supply and infrastructure disruptions at some major demand locations it depends significantly on the continued performance of its vendors and service providers to maintain supply integrity consequently the company can neither predict nor guarantee the continued timely availability of aircraft fuel throughout the companys system 

aircraft fuel has historically been the companys most volatile operating expense due to the highly unpredictable nature of market prices for fuel the company generally sources fuel at prevailing market prices which have historically fluctuated substantially in short periods of time and continue to be highly volatile due to a multitude of unpredictable factors beyond the companys control including changes in global crude oil prices the balance between aircraft fuel supply and demand natural disasters prevailing inventory levels and fuel production and transportation infrastructure prices of fuel are also impacted by 

indirect factors such as geopolitical events economic growth indicators fiscalmonetary policies fuel tax policies changes in regulations environmental concerns and financial investments in energy markets both actual changes in these factors as well as changes in related market expectations can potentially drive rapid changes in fuel prices in short periods of time rising fuel prices can also lead to constraints on the companys regional partners reduced capital available for other spending or other outcomes that could adversely impact the company 

given the highly competitive nature of the airline industry the company has not been able to previously and may not be able to in the future increase its fares and fees sufficiently to offset the full impact of increases in fuel prices especially if these increases are significant rapid and sustained further any such fare or fee increase may not be sustainable may reduce the general demand for air travel and may also eventually impact the companys operations strategic growth and investment plans for the future in addition decreases in fuel prices for an extended period of time may result in increased industry capacity increased competitive actions for market share and lower fares or surcharges if fuel prices were to then subsequently rise quickly there may be a lag between the rise in fuel prices and any improvement of the revenue environment 

the company does not currently hedge its future fuel requirements however to the extent the company decides to start a hedging program to hedge a portion of its future fuel requirements such hedging program may not be successful in mitigating higher fuel costs and any price protection provided may be limited due to the choice of hedging instruments and market conditions including breakdown of correlation between hedging instrument and market price of aircraft fuel and failure of hedge counterparties to the extent that the company decides to use hedge contracts that have the potential to create an obligation to pay upon settlement if fuel prices decline significantly such hedge contracts may limit the companys ability to benefit fully from lower fuel prices in the future if fuel prices decline significantly from the levels existing at the time the company enters into a hedge contract the company may be required to post collateral margin beyond certain thresholds there can be no assurance that the companys hedging arrangements if any would provide any particular level of protection against rises in fuel prices or that its counterparties will be able to perform under the companys hedging arrangements additionally deterioration in the companys financial condition could negatively affect its ability to enter into hedge contracts in the future 

the company has a significant amount of financial leverage from fixed obligations and may seek material amounts of additional financial liquidity in the shortterm and insufficient liquidity may have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition and business 

the company has a significant amount of financial leverage from fixed obligations including aircraft lease and debt financings leases of airport property secured bonds secured loan facilities and other facilities and other material cash obligations in addition the company has substantial noncancelable commitments for capital expenditures including for the acquisition of new and used aircraft and related spare engines if the companys liquidity is materially diminished the companys substantial level of indebtedness the companys noninvestment grade credit ratings and the lack of availability of company assets as collateral for loans or other indebtedness may make it difficult for the company to raise additional capital if needed to meet its liquidity needs on acceptable terms or at all and the company may not be able to timely pay its leases and debts or comply with material provisions of its contractual obligations including covenants under its financing and credit card processing agreements 

in addition to the foregoing the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to holders of our securities including the following 1 we must dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on applicable indebtedness which in turn reduces funds available for operations and capital expenditures 2 our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in the markets in which we compete may be limited 3 we may be at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less indebtedness 4 we are rendered more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions 5 we are exposed to increased interest rate risk given that a portion of our indebtedness obligations are at variable interest rates and 6 our credit ratings may be reduced and our debt and equity securities may significantly decrease in value 

see part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report for additional information regarding the companys liquidity 

agreements governing our debt include financial and other covenants failure to comply with these covenants could result in events of default 

our financing agreements include various financial and other covenants certain of these covenants require ual or united as applicable to maintain minimum liquidity andor minimum collateral coverage ratios uals or uniteds ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond its control including the overall industry revenue environment the level of fuel costs and the appraised value of the collateral in addition our financing agreements contain other negative covenants 

customary for such financings if we fail to comply with these covenants and are unable to remedy or obtain a waiver or amendment an event of default would result 

if an event of default were to occur the lenders could among other things declare outstanding amounts immediately due and payable in addition an event of default or declaration of acceleration under one financing agreement could also result in an event of default under other of our financing agreements due to crossdefault and crossacceleration provisions the acceleration of significant amounts of debt could require us to renegotiate repay or refinance the obligations under our financing arrangements and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

the mileageplus financing agreements in particular contain stringent covenants limit our flexibility to manage our capital structure and limit our ability to make financial and operational changes to the mileageplus program if we were to default under the mileageplus financing agreements the lenders exercise of remedies could result in our loss of the mileageplus program which would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition as a result we may take actions to ensure that the mileageplus financing debt is satisfied or that the lenders remedies under such debt are not exercised potentially to the detriment of our other creditors 

the proposed phase out of the london interbank offer rate could have a material adverse effect on us 

there is currently uncertainty around the phase out of london interbank offered rates libor as of december 31 2021 the company had 130 billion in variable rate indebtedness all or a portion of which uses libor as a benchmark for establishing applicable rates in july 2017 the united kingdom regulator that regulates libor announced its intention to phase out libor rates by the end of 2021 however the ice benchmark administration in its capacity as administrator of usdlibor has announced that it intends to extend publication of usd libor other than oneweek and twomonth tenors by 18 months to june 2023 notwithstanding this possible extension a joint statement by key regulatory authorities calls on banks to cease entering into new contracts that use usdlibor as a reference rate by no later than december 31 2021 the alternative reference rates committee a steering committee comprised of large us financial institutions has proposed replacing usdlibor with a new index calculated by shortterm repurchase agreements  the secured overnight financing rate sofr at this time uncertainty remains as to what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to libor and it is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide libor submissions to the administrator of libor and whether libor rates presently expected to be published until june 2023 will cease to be so published or supported before or after such time we have issued variable rate debt based on libor and have undertaken interest rate swaps that contain a variable element based on libor while many of our liborbased obligations provide for alternative methods of calculating the interest rate payable if libor is not reported the extent and manner of any future changes with respect to methods of calculating libor or replacing libor with another benchmark remain uncertain and impossible to predict at this time and changes to implement a replacement benchmark may require renegotiation of relevant agreements we have also entered into certain agreements that look to sofr as an alternative interest rate method to libor with the potential for spread adjustments and we cannot predict what the impact of these agreements and any transition to or use of sofr could have on us although sofr appears to be the preferred replacement rate for usd libor at this time if the financial market coalesces around an alternative benchmark rate method to libor that is different than sofr we may need to renegotiate these agreements we may be negatively impacted by renegotiated terms in connection with any replacements to libor as a benchmark which may adversely affect our interest rates and result in higher borrowing costs that we cannot predict in addition the phase out or replacement of libor could cause disruptions in the credit markets that lead to a downgrade of our current credit rating which could increase our future borrowing costs and our cost of capital impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us and adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 

the companys ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes to offset future taxable income for us federal income tax purposes may be significantly limited due to various circumstances including certain possible future transactions involving the sale or issuance of ual common stock or if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels 

as of december 31 2021 ual reported consolidated us federal net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately 99 billion the companys ability to use its nol carryforwards and certain other tax attributes will depend on the amount of taxable income it generates in future periods and as a result certain of the companys nol carryforwards and other tax attributes may expire before it can generate sufficient taxable income to use them in full in addition the companys ability to use its nol carryforwards and certain other tax attributes to offset future taxable income may be limited if it experiences an ownership change as defined in section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended potential future transactions involving the sale or issuance of ual common stock may increase the possibility that the company will experience a future ownership change under section 382 such transactions may include the exercise of warrants issued in connection with the cares act programs the issuance of ual common stock for cash the conversion of any future convertible debt the 

repurchase of any debt with the companys common stock the acquisition or disposition of any stock by a stockholder owning 5 or more of the outstanding shares of ual common stock or a combination of the foregoing 

at the companys annual meeting of stockholders held on may 26 2021 the companys stockholders approved a tax benefits preservation plan the plan in order to preserve the companys ability to use its nols and certain other tax attributes to reduce potential future income tax obligations the plan is designed to reduce the likelihood that the company experiences an ownership change by deterring certain acquisitions of company securities there is no assurance however that the deterrent mechanism in the plan will be effective and such acquisitions may still occur in addition the plan may adversely affect the marketability of ual common stock by discouraging existing or potential investors from acquiring ual common stock or additional shares of ual common stock because any nonexempt third party that acquires 49 or more of the thenoutstanding shares of ual common stock would suffer substantial dilution of its ownership interest in the company 

the company may never realize the full value of its intangible assets or its longlived assets causing it to record impairments that may negatively affect its financial condition and operating results 

in accordance with applicable accounting standards the company is required to test its indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently where there is an indication of impairment and certain of its other assets for impairment where there is any indication that an asset may be impaired the company may be required to recognize losses in the future due to among other factors extreme fuel price volatility tight credit markets government regulatory changes decline in the fair values of certain tangible or intangible assets such as our aircraft route authorities airport slots and frequent flyer database unfavorable trends in historical or forecasted results of operations and cash flows and an uncertain economic environment as well as other uncertainties for example during the fiscal year ended december 31 2021 the company recorded 97 million of impairments which includes impairments resulting from current market conditions for used aircraft that are being held for sale and the decision to retire 50seat regional aircraft as a result of the united next order also in 2020 the company recognized 130 million of impairment charges related to its china routes which were primarily caused by the covid19 pandemic the companys subsequent suspension of flights to china and a further delay in the expected return of full capacity to the china markets adverse changes to our forecasted results caused by covid19 or other factors could require the company to recognize additional impairments to its china route indefinitelived intangible assets in future periods the company can provide no assurance that a material impairment loss of tangible or intangible assets will not occur in a future period 

the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly 

the closing price for our common stock has varied between a high of 6245 and a low of 3906 in the year ended december 31 2021 volatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent holders from selling shares at or above the prices paid for them the market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for various reasons which include the market reaction to the covid19 pandemic and our responses thereto the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock changes in the prices or availability of oil or jet fuel our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry the publics reaction to our press releases our other public announcements and our filings with the sec changes in our earnings or recommendations by research analysts who track our common stock or the stock of other airlines changes in general conditions in the united states and global economy financial markets or airline industry including those resulting from changes in fuel prices or fuel shortages war incidents of terrorism pandemics or responses to such events changes in the competitive landscape for the airline industry including any changes resulting from industry consolidation whether or not involving our company our liquidity position and the other risks described in these risk factors 

in addition in recent periods the stock market has experienced extreme declines and volatility this volatility has had a significant negative impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies including us and other companies in our industry 

the companys operating results fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors associated with the airline industry many of which are beyond the companys control 

due to greater demand for air travel during the spring and summer months revenues in the airline industry in the second and third quarters of the year are generally stronger than revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year which are periods of lower travel demand the companys operating results generally reflect this seasonality but have also been impacted by numerous other factors that are not necessarily seasonal including among others extreme or severe weather outbreaks of disease public health issues including global health epidemics or pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic as well as the potential increased government restrictions and regulation atc congestion geological events political instability terrorism natural disasters changes in the competitive environment due to industry consolidation tax obligations general economic conditions and other factors as well as related consumer perceptions as a result the companys quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year and historical operating results in a quarterly or annual period 

are not necessarily indicative of future operating results major global public health issues including pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect the company 

increases in insurance costs or inadequate insurance coverage may materially and adversely impact our business operating results and financial condition 

the company maintains insurance policies including but not limited to terrorism aviation hull and liability workers compensation and property and business interruption insurance but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business if the company is unable to obtain sufficient insurance with acceptable terms the costs of such insurance increase materially or if the coverage obtained is unable to pay or is insufficient relative to actual liability or losses that the company experiences whether due to insurance market conditions policy limitations and exclusions or otherwise our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected

our business and operating results for 2021 continued to be significantly impacted by the covid19 pandemic given the more significant impact of the pandemic on our business and operating results in 2020 we believe that a comparison of our 2021 results to 2019 for certain key metrics in this financial overview discussion is more reflective of the impact of the covid19 pandemic 

our current expectations described below are forwardlooking statements and our actual results and timing may vary materially based on various factors that include but are not limited to those discussed below under cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements and in part i item 1a risk factors  of this form 10k the company is unable to reconcile forwardlooking projections to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap refer to supplemental information below for further details 

impact of the covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic together with the measures implemented or recommended by governmental authorities and private organizations in response to the pandemic has had an adverse impact that has been material to the companys business operating results financial condition and liquidity the company has seen increasing demand for travel both domestically and in countries where entry is permitted however as the situation surrounding the covid19 pandemic remains fluid the pandemic has continued to negatively impact travel demand it remains difficult to reasonably assess or predict the full extent of the ongoing impact of the covid19 pandemic on the companys longerterm operational and financial performance which will depend on a number of future developments many of which are outside the companys control such as the ultimate duration of and factors impacting the recovery from the pandemic including the efficacy and speed of vaccination programs in curbing the spread of the virus in different markets the efficacy and availability of various treatment options the introduction and spread of new variants of the virus that may be resistant to currently approved vaccines or treatment options and the continuation of existing or implementation of new government travel restrictions customer behavior changes and fluctuations in demand for air travel among others the covid19 pandemic and the measures taken in response may continue to impact many aspects of our business operating results financial condition and liquidity in a number of ways including labor shortages including reductions in available skilled labor and related impacts to the companys flight schedules and reputation facility closures and related costs disruptions to the companys and its business partners operations reduced travel demand and consumer spending increased fuel and other operating costs supply chain disruptions logistics constraints inflation volatility in the price of our securities our ability to access capital markets and volatility in the global economy and financial markets generally 

we have reduced our capacity as we managed through the effects of the covid19 pandemic which in 2021 remained significantly lower than capacity prior to the pandemic and resulted in a significant reduction to our revenue through the date of this report we operated at approximately 63 of our full year 2019 capacity during the full year of 2021 we have delayed a portion of our previously planned capacity increases for full year 2022 and may need to implement further modifications the company is taking steps to be prepared for recovery as demand for travel continues to generally increase which include investing in innovative technology focusing on process improvements and implementing the united next transformative strategy 

we have taken steps to strengthen our financial position during this period of market uncertainty which has resulted in an increase of our overall debt levels as of december 31 2021 unrestricted cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaled 184 billion an increase of approximately 135 billion from december 31 2019 we had approximately 411 billion of debt finance lease operating lease and saleleaseback obligations as of december 31 2021 including 45 billion that will become due in the next 12 months up from approximately 205 billion as of december 31 2019 

the companys recovery from the covid19 pandemic has not followed a linear path and due to the significant uncertainty that remains its future operating performance particularly in the shortterm may be subject to volatility risks and uncertainties related to the covid19 pandemic are further described in part i item 1a risk factors— the covid19 pandemic has materially and adversely impacted our business operating results financial condition and liquidity the full extent of the impact will depend on future developments and how quickly we can return to more normal operations among other things if the impacts from the covid19 pandemic extend beyond our assumed timelines our actual results may vary significantly from our expectations of this report

strategic objectives 

in the second quarter of 2021 united announced its united next plan which we believe will have a transformational effect on the customer experience and earnings power of the business it is expected to increase uniteds average gauge in north america the total number of available seats per departure by almost 30 by 2026 versus 2019 as well as significantly lower carbon emissions per seat new aircraft will come with a new signature interior that includes seatback entertainment in every seat larger overhead bins for every passengers carryon bag and the industrys fastest available inflight wifi as well as a bright lookandfeel with led lighting new aircraft are expected to increase north america premium seat counts by 75 per shorthaul departure by 2026 versus 2019 the company plans to replace older smaller mainline jets and at least 200 singleclass regional jets with larger aircraft which we expect will lead to significant sustainability benefits compared to older planes an expected 11 overall improvement in fuel efficiency and an expected 1720 lower carbon emission per seat compared to older planes we believe united next will allow us to differentiate our network and segment our products with a greater premium offering while also maintaining fare competitiveness with lowcost carriers

critical accounting policies 

critical accounting policies are defined as those that are affected by significant judgments and uncertainties which potentially could result in materially different accounting under different assumptions and conditions the company has prepared the financial statements in conformity with gaap which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions the company has identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of the financial statements 

revenue recognition  passenger revenue is recognized when transportation is provided passenger tickets and related ancillary services sold by the company for flights are purchased primarily via credit card transactions with payments collected by the company in advance of the performance of related services the company initially records ticket sales in its advance ticket sales liability deferring revenue recognition until the travel occurs for travel that has more than one flight segment the company deems each segment as a separate performance obligation and recognizes revenue for each segment as travel occurs tickets sold by other airlines where the company provides the transportation are recognized as passenger revenue at the estimated value to be billed to the other airline when travel is provided differences between amounts billed and the actual amounts may be rejected and rebilled or written off if the amount recorded was different from the original estimate when necessary the company records a reserve against its billings and payables with other airlines based on historical experience 

the company sells certain tickets with connecting flights with one or more segments operated by its other airline partners for segments operated by its other airline partners the company has determined that it is acting as an agent on behalf of the other airlines as they are responsible for their portion of the contract ie transportation of the passenger the company as the agent recognizes revenue within other operating revenue at the time of the travel for the net amount representing commission to be retained by the company for any segments flown by other airlines 

advance ticket sales represent the companys liability to provide air transportation in the future all tickets sold at any given point of time have travel dates extending up to 12 months the company defers amounts related to future travel in its advance ticket sales liability account the companys advance ticket sales liability also includes credits issued to customers on electronic travel certificates etcs and future flight credits ffcs primarily for ticket cancellations which can be applied towards a purchase of a new ticket etcs are valid up to two years from the date of issuance however all etcs due to expire prior to december 31 2022 have been extended until december 31 2022 ffcs are valid for 12 months from the original ticket date however all ffcs issued on or before december 31 2021 have been extended to be valid until december 31 2022 as of december 31 2021 the companys advance ticket sales liability included 32 billion related to etcs and ffcs 

the company estimates the value of advance ticket sales that will expire unused breakage and recognizes revenue at the scheduled flight date to determine breakage the company uses its historical experience with expired tickets and other facts such as recent aging trends program changes and modifications that could affect the ultimate expiration patterns of tickets given the uncertainty of travel demand caused by covid19 a significant portion of the etcs and ffcs may expire unused in future periods and get recognized as revenue from breakage the company will update its breakage estimates as future information is received changes in estimates of breakage are recognized prospectively in proportion to the remaining usage of the related tickets 

frequent flyer accounting uniteds mileageplus loyalty program builds customer loyalty by offering awards benefits and services to program participants members in this program earn miles for travel on united united express star alliance members and certain other airlines that participate in the program members can also earn miles by purchasing goods and services from our network of nonairline partners we have contracts to sell miles to these partners with the terms extending from one to eight years these partners include domestic and international credit card issuers retail merchants hotels car rental companies and our participating airline partners miles can be redeemed for free other than taxes and governmentimposed fees discounted or upgraded air travel and nontravel awards 

cobrand agreement  united has a contract the cobrand agreement to sell mileageplus miles to its cobranded credit card partner jpmorgan chase bank usa na chase chase awards miles to mileageplus members based on their credit card activity united identified the following significant separately identifiable performance obligations in the cobrand agreement 

• mileageplus miles awarded – united has a performance obligation to provide mileageplus cardholders with miles to be used for air travel and nontravel award redemptions the company records passenger revenue related to the travel awards when the transportation is provided and records other revenue related to the nontravel awards when the goods or services are delivered the company records the cost associated with nontravel awards in other operating revenue as an agent 

• marketing – united has a performance obligation to provide chase access to uniteds customer list and the use of uniteds brand marketing revenue is recorded to other operating revenue as miles are delivered to chase 

• advertising – united has a performance obligation to provide advertising in support of the mileageplus card in various customer contact points such as uniteds website email promotions direct mail campaigns airport advertising and inflight advertising advertising revenue is recorded to other operating revenue as miles are delivered to chase 

• other travelrelated benefits – uniteds performance obligations are comprised of various items such as waived bag fees seat upgrades and lounge passes lounge passes are recorded to other operating revenue as customers use the lounge passes bag fees and seat upgrades are recorded to passenger revenue at the time of the associated travel 

we account for all the payments received under the cobrand agreement by allocating them to the separately identifiable performance obligations the fair value of the separately identifiable performance obligations is determined using managements estimated selling price of each component the objective of using the estimated selling price based methodology is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis accordingly we determine our best estimate of selling price by considering multiple inputs and methods including but not limited to discounted cash flows brand value volume discounts published selling prices number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed the company estimated the selling prices and volumes over the term of the cobrand agreement in order to determine the allocation of proceeds to each of the components to be delivered we also evaluate volumes on an annual basis which may result in a change in the allocation of the estimated consideration from the cobrand agreement on a prospective basis 

indefinitelived intangible assets the company has indefinitelived intangible assets including goodwill goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis as of october 1 or on an interim basis whenever a triggering event occurs an impairment occurs when the fair value of an intangible asset is less than its carrying value the company determines the fair value using a variation of the income approach known as the excess earnings method which discounts an assets projected future net cash flows to determine the current fair value assumptions used in the discounted cash flow methodology include a discount rate which is based upon the companys current weighted average cost of capital plus an assetspecific risk factor and a projection of sales expenses gross margin tax rates and contributory asset charges for several future years and a terminal growth rate the assumptions used for future projections are determined based upon the companys assetspecific forecasts along with the companys strategic plan these assumptions are inherently uncertain as they relate to future events and circumstances actual results will be influenced by the competitive environment fuel costs and other expenses and potentially other unforeseen events or circumstances that could have a material impact on future results in light of the ongoing impact of the covid19 pandemic on both the us and global economies the significant sustained impact on the demand for travel and government policies that restrict air travel the exact timing of a complete recovery from the covid19 pandemic and the speed at which such recovery could occur continues to remain uncertain we recorded impairment charges of 130 million related to our china route indefinitelived intangible assets during 2020 as a result of the impact of covid19 adverse changes to our forecasted results caused by covid19 or the other factors discussed above could result in additional impairment charges in the future 

see notes 1 and 14 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information 

tax valuation allowance  a tax valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the companys management assesses available positive and negative evidence regarding the companys ability to realize its deferred tax assets and records a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized in order to form a conclusion management considers positive evidence in the form of taxable income in prior carryback years reversing temporary differences tax planning strategies and projections of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible as well as negative evidence such as historical losses although the company incurred losses in 2021 and 2020 management determined that these results were not indicative of future results due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic on its operations the company concluded that the positive evidence outweighs the negative evidence primarily driven by approval and distribution of covid19 vaccines as well as increased confidence with the timing of the recovery the company has 75 billion of deferred tax assets 

of which 21 billion tax effected are attributable to federal net operating losses nols at december 31 2021 the majority of the nols do not expire and the company expects to realize the benefits of the nols through the reversal of certain existing deferred tax liabilities of 62 billion and the remaining 13 billion the income tax equivalent to approximately two years of average precovid19 pretax income through projected future taxable income assumptions about our future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage our business therefore we have not recorded a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets other than the capital loss carryforwards and certain state attributes that have short expiration periods while the company expects to generate sufficient future income to fully utilize its deferred tax assets including nols the company may have to record a valuation allowance which could be material against deferred tax assets if negative evidence such as prolonged losses or reduced forecasted income outweigh positive evidence 

recording a valuation allowance against our nols would not impact our ability to use them to offset cash taxes payable however our ability to use nols may be significantly limited due to various circumstances as discussed in more detail in part i item 1a risk factors— the companys ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes to offset future taxable income for us federal income tax purposes may be significantly limited due to various circumstances including certain possible future transactions involving the sale or issuance of ual common stock or if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels  

as of december 31 2021 the company has recorded 183 million of valuation allowance against its capital loss deferred tax assets capital losses have a limited carryforward period of five years and they can be utilized only to the extent of capital gains the company does not anticipate generating sufficient capital gains to utilize the losses before they expire therefore a valuation allowance is necessary as of december 31 2021 additionally the company recorded a valuation allowance of 27 million on certain state deferred tax assets primarily due to state nols that have short expiration periods 

supplemental information 

the company evaluates its financial performance utilizing various gaap and nongaap financial measures including casmex the company has provided casmex a nongaap financial measure which is not calculated or presented in accordance with gaap as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with gaap management believes that adjusting for special charges credits is useful to investors because special charges credits are not indicative of uals ongoing performance management also believes that excluding thirdparty business expenses such as maintenance and ground handling for third parties provides more meaningful disclosure because these expenses are not directly related to uals core business management also believes that excluding fuel costs is useful to investors because it provides an additional measure of managements performance excluding the effects of a significant cost item over which management has limited influence management also believes that excluding profit sharing allows investors to better understand and analyze uals operating cost performance and provides a more meaningful comparison of our core operating costs to the airline industry 

because this nongaap financial measure is not calculated in accordance with gaap it should not be considered superior to and is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap financial measure and may not be the same as or comparable to any similarly titled measure presented by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items being adjusted we encourage investors to review our financial statements and publiclyfiled reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure 

the company is not providing a target for casm or a reconciliation for casmex projections to casm the most directly comparable gaap measure because the company is unable to predict certain items contained in the gaap measure without unreasonable efforts and it does not provide a reconciliation of forwardlooking measures where it believes such a reconciliation would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors and is unable to reasonably predict certain items contained in the gaap measure without unreasonable efforts this is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of various items that have not yet occurred and are out of the companys control or cannot be reasonably predicted for the same reasons the company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information forwardlooking measures provided without the most directly comparable gaap financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding gaap financial measures see cautionary statement regarding forwardlooking statements below below is a reconciliation of the nongaap financial measure casmex to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure casm for the year ended december 31 2019 in cents

our actual results could differ materially from these forwardlooking statements due to numerous factors including without limitation the following the adverse impacts of the ongoing covid19 global pandemic on our business operating results financial condition and liquidity execution risks associated with our strategic operating plan changes in our network strategy or other factors outside our control resulting in less economic aircraft orders costs related to modification or termination of aircraft orders or entry into less favorable aircraft orders as well as any inability to accept or integrate new aircraft into our fleet as planned any failure to effectively manage and receive anticipated benefits and returns from acquisitions divestitures investments joint ventures and other portfolio actions adverse publicity harm to our brand reduced travel demand potential tort liability and voluntary or mandatory operational restrictions as a result of an accident catastrophe or incident involving us our regional carriers our codeshare partners or another airline the highly competitive nature of the global airline industry and susceptibility of the industry to price discounting and changes in capacity including as a result of alliances joint business arrangements or other consolidations our reliance on a limited number of suppliers to source a majority of our aircraft and certain parts and the impact of any failure to obtain timely deliveries additional equipment or support from any of these suppliers disruptions to our regional network and united express flights provided by thirdparty regional carriers unfavorable economic and political conditions in the united states and globally reliance on thirdparty service providers and the impact of any significant failure of these parties to perform as expected or interruptions in our relationships with these providers or their provision of services extended interruptions or disruptions in service at major airports where we operate and space facility and infrastructure constrains at our hubs or other airports geopolitical conflict terrorist attacks or security events any damage to our reputation or brand image our reliance on technology and automated systems to operate our business and the impact of any significant failure or disruption of or failure to effectively integrate and implement the technology or systems increasing privacy and data security obligations or a significant data breach increased use of social media platforms by us our employees and others the impacts of union disputes employee strikes or slowdowns and other laborrelated disruptions on our operations any failure to attract train or retain skilled personnel including our senior management team or other key employees the monetary and operational costs of compliance with extensive government regulation of the airline industry current or future litigation and regulatory actions or failure to comply with the terms of any settlement order or arrangement relating to these 

actions costs liabilities and risks associated with environmental regulation and climate change including our climate goals high andor volatile fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel the impacts of our significant amount of financial leverage from fixed obligations the possibility we may seek material amounts of additional financial liquidity in the shortterm and the impacts of insufficient liquidity on our financial condition and business failure to comply with financial and other covenants governing our debt including our mileageplus® financing agreements the impacts of the proposed phase out of the london interbank offer rate limitations on our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes to offset future taxable income for us federal income tax purposes our failure to realize the full value of our intangible assets or our longlived assets causing us to record impairments fluctuations in the price of our common stock the impacts of seasonality and other factors associated with the airline industry increases in insurance costs or inadequate insurance coverage and other risks and uncertainties set forth under part i item 1a risk factors of this report as well as other risks and uncertainties set forth from time to time in the reports we file with the sec 

the foregoing list sets forth many but not all of the factors that could impact our ability to achieve results described in any forwardlooking statements investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties in addition certain forwardlooking outlook provided in this report relies on assumptions about the duration and severity of the covid19 pandemic the timing of the return to a more stable business environment the volatility of aircraft fuel prices customer behavior changes and return in demand for air travel among other things together the recovery process if the actual recovery process differs materially from our assumptions the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business could be worse than expected and our actual results may be negatively impacted and may vary materially from our expectations and projections it is routine for our internal projections and expectations to change as the year or each quarter in the year progresses and therefore it should be clearly understood that the internal projections beliefs and assumptions upon which we base our expectations may change for instance we regularly monitor future demand and booking trends and adjust capacity as needed as such our actual flown capacity may differ materially from currently published flight schedules or current estimations 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risk resulting from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates these risks along with other business risks impact our cost of capital it is our policy to manage our debt structure and foreign exchange exposure in order to manage capital costs control financial risks and maintain financial flexibility over the long term in managing market risks we may employ derivatives according to documented policies and procedures including interest rate swaps interest rate locks foreign currency exchange contracts and combined interest rate foreign currency contracts crosscurrency swaps we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes we do not foresee significant changes in the strategies we use to manage market risk in the near future all of our financial instruments including derivatives are subject to counterparty credit risk considered as part of the overall fair value measurement 

interest rates our net income is affected by fluctuations in interest rates eg interest expense on variable rate debt and interest income earned on shortterm investments the companys policy is to manage interest rate risk through a combination of fixed and variable rate debt the following table summarizes information related to the companys interest rate market risk at december 31 2021 in millions 



libor is being phased out starting on january 1 2022 for the oneweek and twomonth usd libor settings and starting on july 1 2023 for the remaining usd libor settings uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes or other reforms to libor may adversely impact our interest rates and related interest expense see part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—other liquidity matters of this report for more information on interest expense risks and uncertainties related to the libor phase out are further described in part i item 1a risk factors—  the proposed phase out of the london interbank offer rate could have a material adverse effect on us 

a change in market interest rates would also impact interest income earned on our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments assuming our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments remain at their average 2021 levels a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a corresponding increase in the companys interest income of approximately 178 million during 2022 

commodity price risk aircraft fuel the price of aircraft fuel can significantly affect the companys operations results of operations financial position and liquidity 

our operational and financial results can be significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel to provide adequate supplies of fuel the company routinely enters into purchase contracts that are customarily indexed to market prices for aircraft fuel and the company generally has some ability to cover shortterm fuel supply and infrastructure disruptions at some major demand locations the companys current strategy is to not enter into transactions to hedge fuel price volatility although the company regularly reviews its policy based on market conditions and other factors a onedollar change in the price of a barrel of aircraft fuel would change the companys annual fuel expense by approximately 102 million assuming flying levels similar to 2019 

foreign currency the company generates revenues and incurs expenses in numerous foreign currencies changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the companys results of operations through changes in the dollar value of foreign currencydenominated operating revenues and expenses some of the companys more significant foreign currency exposures include the canadian dollar chinese renminbi european euro british pound and japanese yen the companys current strategy is to not enter into transactions to hedge its foreign currency exposure although the company regularly reviews its policy based on market conditions and other factors 

the result of a uniform 1 strengthening in the value of the us dollar from december 31 2021 levels relative to each of the currencies in which the company has foreign currency exposure would result in a decrease in pretax income of approximately 14 million for the year ending december 31 2022 this sensitivity analysis was prepared based upon projected 2022 foreign currencydenominated revenues and expenses as of december 31 2021

operations 

the company transports people and cargo throughout north america and to destinations in asia europe africa the pacific the middle east and latin america ual through united and its regional carriers operates across six continents with hubs at newark liberty international airport newark chicago ohare international airport chicago ohare denver international airport denver george bush intercontinental airport houston bush los angeles international airport lax ab won pat international airport guam san francisco international airport sfo and washington dulles international airport washington dulles 

all of the companys domestic hubs are located in large business and population centers contributing to a large amount of origin and destination traffic the hub and spoke system allows us to transport passengers between a large number of destinations with substantially more frequent service than if each route were served directly the hub system also allows us to add service to a new destination from a large number of cities using only one or a limited number of aircraft as discussed under alliances below united is a member of star alliance the worlds largest alliance network 

the company began experiencing a significant decline in passenger demand related to the novel coronavirus covid19 during the first quarter of 2020 the full extent of the ongoing impact of covid19 on the companys longerterm operational and financial performance will depend on future developments including those outside our control related to the efficacy and speed of vaccination programs in curbing the spread of the virus the introduction and spread of new variants of the virus which may be resistant to currently approved vaccines passenger testing requirements mask mandates or other restrictions on travel all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with certainty in response to decreased demand the company cut relative to 2019 capacity approximately 57 of its scheduled capacity for 2020 in the first quarter of 2021 the company expects scheduled capacity to be down at least 51 versus the first quarter of 2019 the company plans to continue to proactively evaluate and cancel flights on a rolling 60day basis until it sees signs of a recovery in demand and expects demand to remain suppressed relative to 2019 levels until vaccines for covid19 are widely distributed and are effective in curbing 

the spread of the virus in addition the company does not currently expect the recovery from covid19 to follow a linear path as such the companys actual flown capacity may differ materially from its currently scheduled capacity 

regional the company has contractual relationships with various regional carriers to provide regional aircraft service branded as united express this regional service complements our operations by carrying traffic that connects to our hubs and allows flights to smaller cities that cannot be provided economically with mainline aircraft champlain enterprises llc dba commutair commutair republic airline inc republic gojet airlines llc gojet mesa airlines inc mesa skywest airlines inc skywest and air wisconsin airlines llc air wisconsin are all regional carriers that operate with capacity contracted to united under capacity purchase agreements cpas under these cpas the company pays the regional carriers contractually agreed fees carrier costs for operating these flights plus a variable rate adjustment based on agreed performance metrics subject to annual adjustments the fees are based on specific rates multiplied by specific operating statistics eg block hours departures as well as fixed monthly amounts under these cpas the company is also responsible for all fuel costs incurred as well as landing fees and other costs which are either passed through by the regional carrier to the company without any markup or directly incurred by the company in some cases the company owns some or all of the aircraft subject to the cpa and leases such aircraft to the regional carrier in return the regional carriers operate the capacity of the aircraft included within the scope of such cpa exclusively for united on schedules determined by the company the company also determines pricing and revenue management assumes the inventory and distribution risk for the available seats and permits mileage accrual and redemption for regional flights through its mileageplus loyalty program the significant decline in demand for air travel services resulting from the covid19 pandemic has also materially impacted demand for regional carrier services and as a result the companys utilization of its regional network is significantly reduced and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future as a result we may face claims that we failed to perform certain obligations under our agreements with our regional carriers and may incur damages additionally in july 2020 the company announced its plans to consolidate its embraer 145 e145 operations into a single regional partner commutair as a result the company terminated its cpa with expressjet airlines llc a domestic regional airline expressjet expressjet flew its last commercial flight on behalf of united on september 30 2020 additionally united transferred all of its e145 operations over to commutair as uniteds sole regional partner for this aircraft type we expect the disruption to services resulting from the covid19 pandemic to continue to adversely affect our regional carriers some of which may declare bankruptcy or otherwise cease to operate

aircraft fuel the table below summarizes the fuel consumption and expense of uals aircraft including the operations of our regional partners operating under cpas during the last three years 



our operational and financial results can be significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel to provide adequate supplies of fuel the company routinely enters into purchase contracts that are customarily indexed to market prices for aircraft fuel and the company generally has some ability to cover shortterm fuel supply and infrastructure disruptions at certain major demand locations the price of aircraft fuel has fluctuated substantially in the past several years the companys current strategy is to not enter into transactions to hedge its fuel consumption although the company regularly reviews its strategy based on market conditions and other factors 

thirdparty business united generates thirdparty business revenue that includes maintenance services catering frequent flyer award nontravel redemptions and ground handling thirdparty business revenue is recorded in other operating revenue expenses associated with thirdparty business except nontravel redemptions are recorded in other operating expenses nontravel redemptions expenses are recorded to other operating revenue

industry conditions 

covid19 the covid19 pandemic together with the measures implemented or recommended by governmental authorities and private organizations in response to the pandemic has had an adverse impact that has been material to the airline industry measures such as shelter in place or quarantine requirements international and domestic travel restrictions or advisories limitations on public gatherings social distancing recommendations remote work arrangements and closures of tourist destinations and attractions as well as consumer perceptions of the safety ease and predictability of air travel have contributed to a precipitous decline in passenger demand and bookings for both business and leisure travel 

the full extent of the ongoing impact of covid19 on the companys longerterm operational and financial performance will depend on future developments including those outside our control related to the efficacy and speed of vaccination programs in curbing the spread of the virus the introduction and spread of new variants of the virus which may be resistant to currently approved vaccines passenger testing requirements mask mandates or other restrictions on travel all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with certainty effective august 30 2020 united permanently eliminated change fees on all standard economy and premium cabin tickets for travel within the 50 us states washington dc puerto rico and the us virgin islands also in december 2020 the company eliminated change fees on flights from the us to all international destinations and fees on basic economy and all other international travel tickets issued by march 31 2021 in addition effective january 1 2021 united began allowing passengers to standby for free on a flight departing the day of their travel regardless of the type of ticket or class of service while mileageplus premier members can confirm a seat on a different flight on the same day with the same departure and arrival cities as their original ticket if a seat in the same ticket fare class is available 

domestic competition the domestic airline industry is highly competitive and dynamic the companys competitors consist primarily of other airlines and to a certain extent other forms of transportation currently any us carrier deemed fit by the us department of transportation the dot is largely free to operate scheduled passenger service between any two points within the united states competition can be direct in the form of another carrier flying the exact nonstop route or indirect where a carrier serves the same two cities nonstop from an alternative airport in that city or via an itinerary requiring a connection at another airport air carriers cost structures are not uniform and are influenced by numerous factors carriers with lower costs may offer lower fares to passengers which could have a potential negative impact on the companys revenues domestic pricing decisions are impacted by intense competitive pressure exerted on the company by other us airlines in order to remain competitive and maintain passenger traffic levels we often find it necessary to match competitors discounted fares since we compete in a dynamic marketplace attempts to generate additional revenue through increased fares often fail 

international competition internationally the company competes not only with us airlines but also with foreign carriers international competition has increased and may continue to increase in the future as a result of airline mergers and acquisitions jbas alliances restructurings liberalization of aviation bilateral agreements and new or increased service by competitors including governmentsubsidized competitors from certain middle east countries competition on international routes is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation the companys ability to compete successfully with nonus carriers on international routes depends in part on its ability to generate traffic to and from the entire united states via its integrated domestic route network and its ability to overcome business and operational challenges across its network worldwide foreign carriers currently are prohibited by us law from carrying local passengers between two points in the united states and the company generally experiences comparable restrictions in foreign countries separately fifth freedom rights allow the company to operate between points in two different foreign countries and foreign carriers may also have fifth freedom rights between the us and another foreign country in the absence of fifth freedom rights or some other extrabilateral right to conduct operations between two foreign countries us carriers are constrained from carrying passengers to points beyond designated international gateway cities to compensate partially for these structural limitations us and foreign carriers have entered into alliances immunized jbas and marketing arrangements that enable these carriers to exchange traffic between each others flights and route networks through these arrangements the company strives to provide consumers with a growing number of seamless costeffective and convenient travel options see alliances above for additional information 

seasonality the air travel business is subject to seasonal fluctuations historically demand for air travel is higher in the second and third quarters driving higher revenues than in the first and fourth quarters which are periods of lower travel demand 

industry regulation 

airlines are subject to extensive domestic and international regulatory oversight the following discussion summarizes the principal elements of the regulatory framework applicable to our business regulatory requirements including but not limited to those discussed below affect our operations and increase our operating costs and future regulatory developments may continue to do the same in the future in addition should any of our governmental authorizations or certificates be modified suspended or revoked our business and competitive position could be materially adversely affected see part i item 1a risk 

factors—the airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation which imposes significant costs and may adversely impact our business operating results and financial condition for additional information on the material effects of compliance with government regulations 

domestic regulation all carriers engaged in air transportation in the united states are subject to regulation by the dot absent an exemption no air carrier may provide air transportation of passengers or property without first being issued a dot certificate of public convenience and necessity the dot also grants international route authority approves international codeshare arrangements and regulates methods of competition the dot regulates consumer protection and maintains jurisdiction over advertising denied boarding compensation tarmac delays baggage liability and other areas and may add additional expensive regulatory burdens in the future the dot has launched investigations or claimed rulemaking authority to regulate commercial agreements among carriers or between carriers and third parties in a wide variety of contexts 

airlines are also regulated by the federal aviation administration the faa an agency within the dot primarily in the areas of flight safety air carrier operations and aircraft maintenance and airworthiness the faa issues air carrier operating certificates and aircraft airworthiness certificates prescribes maintenance procedures oversees airport operations and regulates pilot and other employee training from time to time the faa issues directives that require air carriers to inspect modify or ground aircraft and other equipment potentially causing the company to incur substantial unplanned expenses the airline industry is also subject to numerous other federal laws and regulations the us department of homeland security dhs has jurisdiction over virtually every aspect of civil aviation security the antitrust division of the us department of justice doj has jurisdiction over certain airline competition matters the us postal service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail by airlines labor relations in the airline industry are generally governed by the railway labor act rla a federal statute the company is also subject to investigation inquiries by the dot faa doj dhs the us food and drug administration fda the us department of agriculture usda centers for disease control and prevention cdc us occupational safety and health administration osha  and other us and international regulatory bodies 

airport access access to landing and takeoff rights or slots at several major us airports served by the company are subject to government regulation federallymandated domestic slot restrictions that limit operations and regulate capacity currently apply at three airports reagan national airport in washington dc reagan national and john f kennedy international airport and laguardia airport laguardia in the new york city metropolitan region additional restrictions on takeoff and landing slots at these and other airports may be implemented in the future and could affect the companys rights of ownership and transfer as well as its operations 

legislation  the airline industry is subject to legislative actions or inactions that may have an impact on operations and costs in 2018 the us congress approved a fiveyear reauthorization for the faa which encompasses significant aviation tax and policyrelated issues the law includes a range of policy changes related to airline customer service and aviation safety implementation of some items continues into the new administration and depending on how they are implemented could impact our operations and costs us congressional action in response to the covid19 pandemic has provided funding for us airlines in both grants and loans the us congress has imposed limited conditions on airlines accepting funding including workforce retention and minimum service requirements with the change in control of the us congress and a new presidential administration any future funding or other pandemic relief could include additional requirements that could impact our operations and costs additionally the us congress may consider legislation related to environmental issues or increases to the us federal corporate income tax rate which could impact the company and the airline industry 

catering operations  the company owns and operates catering kitchens at airports in denver cleveland newark houston and honolulu which prepare readytoeat food for united flights some of the companys kitchens also prepare readytoeat food for other domestic and international airlines the companys onboard food service operations are subject to fda regulation through its interstate conveyance sanitation regulations and the companys catering operations are subject to regulation by the fda and the usda as well as other federal state and local regulatory agencies in particular the fda enforces the federal food safety modernization act which requires all food manufacturers including readytoeat catering operations to implement stringent riskbased preventive controls as a result the companys catering and food service operations are periodically subject to inspections and enforcement by regulatory agencies 

international regulation international air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation in connection with the companys international services the company is regulated by both the us government and the governments of the foreign countries the company serves in addition the availability of international routes to us carriers is regulated by aviation agreements between the us and foreign governments and in some cases fares and schedules require the approval of the dot andor the relevant foreign governments 

legislation foreign countries are increasingly enacting passenger protection laws rules and regulations that meet or exceed us requirements in cases where this activity exceeds us requirements additional burden and liability may be placed on the 

company certain countries have regulations requiring passenger compensation andor enforcement penalties from the company in addition to changes in operating procedures due to canceled and delayed flights 

airport access historically access to foreign markets has been tightly controlled through bilateral agreements between the us and each foreign country involved these agreements regulate the markets served the number of carriers allowed to serve each market and the frequency of carriers flights since the early 1990s the us has pursued a policy of open skies meaning all usflag carriers have access to the destination under which the us government has negotiated a number of bilateral agreements allowing unrestricted access between us and foreign markets currently there are more than 100 open skies agreements in effect however even with open skies many of the airports that the company serves in europe asia and latin america maintain slot controls a large number of these slot controls exist due to congestion environmental and noise protection and reduced capacity due to runway and air traffic control atc construction work among other reasons london heathrow international airport frankfurt rheinmain airport shanghai pudong international airport beijing capital international airport sao paulo guarulhos international airport and tokyo haneda international airport are among the most restrictive foreign airports due to slot and capacity limitations 

the companys ability to serve some foreign markets and expand into certain others is limited by the absence of aviation agreements between the us government and the relevant foreign governments shifts in us or foreign government aviation policies may lead to the alteration or termination of air service agreements depending on the nature of any such change the value of the companys international route authorities and slot rights may be materially enhanced or diminished similarly foreign governments control their airspace and can restrict our ability to overfly their territory enhancing or diminishing the value of the companys existing international route authorities and slot rights 

the covid19 pandemic has caused most governments to restrict entry to foreign nationals with some exceptions and to impose multiple health management rules which can include covid19 testing quarantine upon arrival health declarations and temperature screens among others such requirements may result in reduced demand for travel and cause the company to suspend service to some foreign markets certain foreign governments have granted waivers for limited periods that allow the company to maintain existing slot rights and route authorizations while not operating at a particular foreign point the airline industry is advocating for the continuation of such waivers until the operating and demand environment return to normal but future waivers are not guaranteed 

environmental regulation the airline industry is subject to increasingly stringent federal state local and international environmental requirements including those regulating emissions to air water discharges safe drinking water and the use and management of hazardous substances and wastes 

climate change  there is an increasing global regulatory focus on greenhouse gas ghg emissions and their potential impacts relating to climate change an initiative to regulate ghg emissions from aviation known as the european union eu emission trading system ets was adopted in 2009 but applicability to flights arriving at or departing from airports outside the eu has been postponed several times in december 2017 the european parliament voted to extend exemptions for extraeu flights until december 2023 in order to align the extension date with the completion of the pilot phase of the international civil aviation organizations icao carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation corsia corsia which was adopted in october 2016 is intended to create a single global marketbased measure to achieve carbonneutral growth for international aviation which can be achieved through airline purchases of eligible carbon offset credits and the use of eligible sustainable fuels the unprecedented nature of the covid19 pandemic prompted icao to include only 2019 emissions as opposed to the originally planned average of 201920 emissions as the baseline upon which offsetting obligations would be calculated for the pilot phase 202123 of the scheme the applicable baseline for the subsequent phases of the scheme however is still uncertain the european parliament is expected to assess corsia implementation and reassess the applicability of eu ets to international aviation in 2024 at which point the eu could require all extra and intraeu flights to participate in eu ets certain corsia program aspects could potentially be affected by the results of the pilot phase of the program and thus the impact of corsia cannot be fully predicted however corsia is expected to increase operating costs for the company depending on a number of factors including the number of its flights that are subject to corsia the fuel efficiency of the companys fleet the companys purchase and use of corsiaeligible sustainable fuels aviation sector growth the price of corsiaeligible offsets and the applicable baseline years applied to future phases of the program in 2017 icao also adopted a carbon dioxide co 2  emission standard for aircraft in december 2020 the us environmental protection agency epa adopted its own aircraft and aircraft engine ghg emissions standards which are aligned with the 2017 icao airplane co 2 emission standards while united endeavors to comply with all applicable environmental regulations uniteds ecoskies commitment to becoming a more environmentally sustainable company extends beyond seeking to comply with regulatory requirements 

we have made a series of tangible commitments and actions to help reduce our carbon emission footprint including the following 

• in 2015 we invested 30 million in fulcrum bioenergy a sustainable aviation fuel saf producer that converts trash to lowcarbon jet fuel 

• in 2016 we became the first airline globally to use saf in regular operations on a continuous basis and as of december 31 2020 based on publicly announced commitments have purchased more saf than any other us commercial airline 

• in 2018 we became the first us airline to establish a climate goal of reducing our emissions 50 by 2050 versus our 2005 baseline 

• in 2020 

◦ we pledged to become 100 green by reducing our ghg emissions by 100 by 2050—without relying on voluntary carbon offsets 

◦ we became the first airline to announce a commitment to invest in direct air capture technology through 1pointfive a joint venture between oxy low carbon ventures and rusheen capital 

◦ the carbon disclosure project cdp named united as the only airline globally to its climate a list for the companys actions to cut emissions mitigate climate risks and develop the lowcarbon economy marking the seventh consecutive year that united had the highest cdp score among us airlines 

• in the first quarter of 2021 united entered into an agreement to work with and to invest in air mobility company archer aviation inc on the development of electric vertical takeoff and landing evtol aircraft that have the potential for future use as an air taxi in urban markets

other regulations  our operations are subject to a variety of other environmental laws and regulations both in the united states and internationally these include noiserelated restrictions on aircraft types and operating times and state and local air quality initiatives which have resulted or could in the future result in curtailments in services increased operating costs limits on expansion or further emission reduction requirements certain airports andor governments both domestically and internationally either have established or are seeking to establish environmental fees and other requirements applicable to carbon emissions local air quality pollutants andor noise the implementation of these requirements is expected to result in restrictions on mobile sources of air pollutants such as cars trucks and airport ground support equipment in corresponding locations various states have passed legislation restricting the use of class b firefighting foam agents that contain intentionally added per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas which are expected to require the company to incur costs to convert existing fixed foam fire suppression systems to accommodate pfasfree firefighting foam agents finally environmental cleanup laws could require the company to undertake or subject the company to liability for investigation and remediation costs at certain owned or leased locations or thirdparty disposal locations 

until the applicability of new regulations to our specific operations is better defined andor until pending regulations are finalized future costs to comply with such regulations will remain uncertain but are likely to increase our operating costs over time while we continue to monitor these developments the precise nature of future requirements and their applicability to the company are difficult to predict but the financial impact to the company and the aviation industry could be significant

for a more complete discussion of the material risks facing the companys business see below 

risks relating to covid19 

the global pandemic resulting from a novel strain of coronavirus has had an adverse impact that has been material to the companys business operating results financial condition and liquidity and the duration and spread of the pandemic could result in additional adverse impacts the outbreak of another disease or similar public health threat in the future could also have an adverse effect on the companys business operating results financial condition and liquidity 

the novel coronavirus covid19 pandemic together with the measures implemented or recommended by governmental authorities and private organizations in response to the pandemic has had an adverse impact that has been material to the companys business operating results financial condition and liquidity measures such as shelter in place or quarantine requirements international and domestic travel restrictions or advisories limitations on public gatherings social distancing recommendations remote work arrangements and closures of tourist destinations and attractions as well as consumer perceptions of the safety ease and predictability of air travel have contributed to a precipitous decline in passenger demand and bookings for both business and leisure travel 

the company began experiencing a significant decline in international and domestic demand related to covid19 during the first quarter of 2020 the decline in demand caused a material deterioration in our revenues in 2020 resulting in a net loss of 71 billion the full extent of the ongoing impact of covid19 on the companys longerterm operational and financial performance will depend on future developments including those outside our control related to the efficacy and speed of vaccination programs in curbing the spread of the virus the introduction and spread of new variants of the virus which may be resistant to currently approved vaccines passenger testing requirements mask mandates or other restrictions on travel all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with certainty in response to decreased demand the company cut relative to 2019 capacity approximately 57 of its scheduled capacity for 2020 in the first quarter of 2021 the company expects scheduled capacity to be down at least 51 versus the first quarter of 2019 the company plans to continue to proactively evaluate and cancel flights on a rolling 60day basis until it sees signs of a recovery in demand and expects demand to remain suppressed relative to 2019 levels until vaccines for covid19 are widely distributed and are effective in curbing the spread of the virus in addition the company does not currently expect the recovery from covid19 to follow a linear path as such the companys actual flown capacity may differ materially from its currently scheduled capacity 

the company has taken a number of actions in response to the decreased demand for air travel in addition to the schedule reductions discussed above the company reduced its planned capital expenditures and reduced operating expenditures for 2020 terminated its share repurchase program issued or entered into approximately 134 billion in secured notes secured facilities and new aircraft financings raised approximately 21 billion in cash proceeds from the issuance and sale of ual common stock borrowed 10 billion under the 20 billion revolving credit facility entered into an agreement to finance certain aircraft currently subject to purchase agreements through sale and leaseback transactions deferred 199 million in payroll taxes incurred through december 31 2020 as provided by the cares act until december 2021 at which time 50 is due with the remaining amount due december 2022 temporarily grounded certain of its mainline fleet implemented strategic workforce reductions and took a number of other actions to reduce employeerelated costs in addition in connection with the payroll support program under the cares act united entered into payroll support program agreements with the us treasury department treasury that provided the company with total funding of approximately 77 billion to pay the salaries and benefits of employees through march 31 2021 the company also entered into a term loan facility of up to approximately 75 billion the term loan facility pursuant to the loan program established under section 4003b of the cares act the loan program and on september 28 2020 united borrowed 520 million under the term loan facility the grants and loans under the cares act subject the company and its business to certain restrictions including but not limited to restrictions on the payment of dividends and the ability to repurchase uals equity securities requirements to maintain certain levels of scheduled service requirements to recall certain furloughed employees and maintain us employment levels through march 31 2021 and certain limitations on executive compensation these restrictions and requirements have materially affected and will continue to materially affect the companys operations and the company may not be successful in managing these impacts for the duration of the restrictions in particular limitations on executive 

compensation which depending on the form of aid could extend up to six years may impact the companys ability to attract and retain senior management or attract other key employees during this critical time 

the full extent of the ongoing impact of covid19 on the companys longerterm operational and financial performance and liquidity position will depend on future developments including the effectiveness of the mitigation strategies discussed above in offsetting decreased demand the duration and spread of covid19 and related travel advisories and restrictions the impact of covid19 on overall longterm domestic and international demand for air travel including the impact on overall demand for business travel as a result of increased usage of teleconferencing and other technologies the impact of covid19 on the financial health and operations of the companys business partners and future governmental actions including whether applicable governmental authorities will continue to grant waivers of usage requirements for certain of the companys slots routes and gates or will require passenger testing for domestic us travel all of these future developments are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with certainty the covid19 pandemic has had a material impact on the company and the continuation of reduced demand could have a material adverse effect on the companys business operating results financial condition and liquidity 

in addition an outbreak of another disease or similar public health threat or fear of such an event that affects travel demand travel behavior or travel restrictions could have a material adverse impact on the companys business financial condition and operating results outbreaks of other diseases could also result in increased government restrictions and regulation such as those actions described above or otherwise which could adversely affect our operations 

covid19 has materially disrupted our strategic operating plans in the nearterm and there are risks to our business operating results and financial condition associated with executing our strategic operating plans in the longterm 

covid19 has materially disrupted our strategic operating plans in the nearterm and there are risks to our business operating results and financial condition associated with executing our strategic operating plans in the longterm in recent years we have announced several strategic operating plans including several revenuegenerating initiatives and plans to optimize our revenue such as our plans to add capacity including international expansion and new or increased service to midsize airports initiatives and plans to optimize and control our costs and opportunities to enhance our segmentation and improve the customer experience at all points in air travel in developing our strategic operating plans we make certain assumptions including but not limited to those related to customer demand competition market consolidation the availability of aircraft and the global economy actual economic market and other conditions have been and may continue to be different from our assumptions most significantly in 2020 the precipitous decline in demand for air travel required us to cut rather than grow capacity and materially and adversely impacted our ability to execute our strategic operating plans if we do not successfully execute or adjust our strategic operating plans in the longterm or if actual results continue to vary significantly from our prior assumptions or vary significantly from our future assumptions our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted 

risks relating to our business and industry 

unfavorable economic and political conditions in the united states and globally may have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

the companys business and operating results are significantly impacted by us and global economic and political conditions the airline industry is highly cyclical and the level of demand for air travel is correlated to the strength of the us and global economies robust demand for the companys air transportation services depends largely on favorable economic conditions including the strength of the domestic and foreign economies low unemployment levels strong consumer confidence levels and the availability of consumer and business credit air transportation is often a discretionary purchase that leisure travelers may limit or eliminate during difficult economic times shorthaul travelers in particular have the option to replace air travel with surface travel in addition during periods of unfavorable economic conditions business travelers historically have reduced the volume of their travel either due to costsaving initiatives the replacement of travel with alternatives such as videoconferencing or as a result of decreased business activity requiring travel during such periods the companys business and operating results may be adversely affected due to significant declines in industry passenger demand particularly with respect to the companys business and premium cabin travelers and a reduction in fare levels 

as a global business with operations outside of the united states from which it derives significant operating revenues volatile conditions in certain international regions may have a negative impact on the companys operating results and its ability to achieve its business objectives the companys international operations are a vital part of its worldwide airline network political disruptions and instability in certain regions can negatively impact the demand and network availability for air travel additionally any deterioration in global trade relations such as increased tariffs or other trade barriers could result in a decrease in the demand for international air travel 

stagnant or weakening global economic conditions either in the united states or in other geographic regions may have a material adverse effect on the companys revenues operating results and liquidity 

the global airline industry is highly competitive and susceptible to price discounting and changes in capacity which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

the airline industry is highly competitive marked by significant competition with respect to routes fares schedules both timing and frequency services products customer service and frequent flyer programs consolidation in the airline industry the rise of wellfunded government sponsored international carriers changes in international alliances and the creation of immunized jbas have altered and are expected to continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with increased financial resources more extensive global networks and services and competitive cost structures 

airlines also compete by increasing or decreasing their capacity including route systems and the number of destinations served several of the companys domestic and international competitors have increased their international capacity by including service to some destinations that the company currently serves causing overlap in destinations served and therefore increasing competition for those destinations this increased competition in both domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on the companys business operating results and financial condition 

the companys us operations are subject to competition from traditional network carriers national pointtopoint carriers and discount carriers including lowcost carriers and ultralowcost carriers such carriers may have lower costs and provide service at lower fares to destinations also served by the company the significant presence of lowcost carriers and ultralowcost carriers which engage in substantial price discounting may diminish our ability to achieve sustained profitability on domestic and international routes this level of discounted pricing has also caused us to reduce fares for certain routes resulting in lower yields on many domestic markets our ability to compete in the domestic market effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure if we cannot maintain our costs at a competitive level then our business operating results and financial condition could continue to be materially and adversely affected in addition our competitors have established new routes and destinations including some at our hub airports in light of the expansion opportunities presented by the covid19 pandemic which may compete with our existing routes and destinations and expansion plans 

our international operations are subject to competition from both foreign and domestic carriers competition is significant from government subsidized competitors from certain middle east countries these carriers have large numbers of international widebody aircraft on order and are increasing service to the us from their hubs in the middle east the government support provided to these carriers has allowed them to grow quickly reinvest in their product invest in other airlines and expand their global presence we also face competition from foreign carriers operating under fifth freedom rights permitted under international treaties that allow certain carriers to provide service to and from stopover points between their home country and ultimate destination including points in the united states in competition with service provided by us 

through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers us carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation such as services to and beyond traditional global gateway cities similarly foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior us passenger traffic beyond traditional us gateway cities through these relationships in addition several jbas among us and foreign carriers have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules pricing sales and inventory if we are not able to continue participating in these types of alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements in the future our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

our mileageplus frequent flyer program benefits from the attractiveness and competitiveness of united airlines as a material purchaser of award miles and the majority recipient for mileage redemption if we are not able to maintain a competitive and attractive airline business our ability to acquire engage and retain customers in the loyalty program may be adversely affected which could adversely affect the loyalty programs operating results and financial condition 

further our mileageplus frequent flyer program also faces significant and increasing direct competition from the frequent flyer programs offered by other airlines as well as from similar loyalty programs offered by banks and other financial services companies competition among loyalty programs is intense regarding customer acquisition incentives the value and utility of program currency rewards range and value fees required usage and other terms and conditions of these programs if we are not able to maintain a competitive frequent flyer program our ability to attract and retain customers to mileageplus and united alike may be adversely affected which could adversely affect our enterprise operating results and financial condition 

high andor volatile fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a material adverse impact on the companys strategic plans operating results financial condition and liquidity 

aircraft fuel is critical to the companys operations and is one of our largest operating expenses during the year ended december 31 2020 the companys fuel expense was approximately 32 billion the timely and adequate supply of fuel to meet operational demand depends on the continued availability of reliable fuel supply sources as well as related service and delivery infrastructure although the company has some ability to cover shortterm fuel supply and infrastructure disruptions at some major demand locations it depends significantly on the continued performance of its vendors and service providers to maintain supply integrity consequently the company can neither predict nor guarantee the continued timely availability of aircraft fuel throughout the companys system 

aircraft fuel has historically been the companys most volatile operating expense due to the highly unpredictable nature of market prices for fuel the company generally sources fuel at prevailing market prices market prices for aircraft fuel have historically fluctuated substantially in short periods of time and continue to be highly volatile due to a dependence on a multitude of unpredictable factors beyond the companys control these factors include changes in global crude oil prices the balance between aircraft fuel supply and demand natural disasters prevailing inventory levels and fuel production and transportation infrastructure prices of fuel are also impacted by indirect factors such as geopolitical events economic growth indicators fiscalmonetary policies fuel tax policies changes in regulations environmental concerns and financial investments in energy markets both actual changes in these factors as well as changes in related market expectations can potentially drive rapid changes in fuel prices in short periods of time 

given the highly competitive nature of the airline industry the company may not be able to increase its fares and fees sufficiently to offset the full impact of increases in fuel prices especially if these increases are significant rapid and sustained further any such fare or fee increase may not be sustainable may reduce the general demand for air travel and may also eventually impact the companys strategic growth and investment plans for the future in addition decreases in fuel prices for an extended period of time may result in increased industry capacity increased competitive actions for market share and lower fares or surcharges if fuel prices were to then subsequently rise quickly there may be a lag between the rise in fuel prices and any improvement of the revenue environment 

to protect against increases in the market prices of fuel the company may hedge a portion of its future fuel requirements the company does not currently hedge its future fuel requirements however to the extent the company decides to start a hedging program such hedging program may not be successful in mitigating higher fuel costs and any price protection provided may be limited due to the choice of hedging instruments and market conditions including breakdown of correlation between hedging instrument and market price of aircraft fuel and failure of hedge counterparties to the extent that the company decides to hedge a portion of its future fuel requirements and uses hedge contracts that have the potential to create an obligation to pay upon settlement if fuel prices decline significantly such hedge contracts may limit the companys ability to benefit fully from lower fuel prices in the future if fuel prices decline significantly from the levels existing at the time the company enters into a hedge contract the company may be required to post collateral margin beyond certain thresholds there can be no assurance that the companys hedging arrangements if any will provide any particular level of protection against rises in fuel prices or that its counterparties will be able to perform under the companys hedging arrangements additionally deterioration in the companys financial condition could negatively affect its ability to enter into new hedge contracts in the future 

the company relies heavily on technology and automated systems to operate its business and any significant failure or disruption of or failure to effectively integrate and implement the technology or these systems could materially harm its business 

the company depends on automated systems and technology to operate its business including but not limited to computerized airline reservation systems electronic tickets electronic airport kiosks demand prediction software flight operations systems inflight wireless internet cloudbased technologies revenue management systems accounting systems technical and business operations systems telecommunication systems and commercial websites and applications including wwwunitedcom and the united airlines app uniteds website and other automated systems must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic maintain secure information and deliver important flight and schedule information as well as process critical financial transactions these systems could suffer substantial or repeated disruptions due to various events some of which are beyond the companys control including natural disasters power failures terrorist attacks equipment or software failures or cyber security attacks we have initiatives in place to prevent disruptions and disaster recovery plans and we continue to invest in improvements to these initiatives and plans however these measures may not be adequate to prevent or mitigate disruptions substantial or repeated systems failures or disruptions including failures or disruptions related to the companys complex integration of systems could reduce the attractiveness of the companys services versus those of its competitors materially impair its ability to market its services and operate its flights result in the unauthorized release of 

confidential or otherwise protected information result in increased costs lost revenue and the loss or compromise of important data and may adversely affect the companys business operating results and financial condition 

the company may also face challenges in integrating implementing and modifying the automated systems and technology required to operate its business as a result of the complexity of such automated systems and technology the integration implementation and modification process may require significant expenditures human resources the development of effective internal controls and the transformation of business and financial processes if the company is unable to timely or effectively integrate implement or modify its systems and technology the companys operations could be adversely affected  

the companys business relies extensively on thirdparty service providers including certain technology providers failure of these parties to perform as expected or interruptions in the companys relationships with these providers or their provision of services to the company could have a material adverse effect on the companys business operating results and financial condition 

the company has engaged thirdparty service providers to perform a large number of functions that are integral to its business including regional operations operation of customer service call centers distribution and sale of airline seat inventory provision of information technology infrastructure and services transmitting or uploading of data provision of aircraft maintenance and repairs provision of various utilities and performance of airport ground services aircraft fueling operations and catering services among other vital functions and services the company does not directly control these thirdparty service providers although generally it does enter into agreements that define expected service performance and compliance requirements such as compliance with legal requirements including anticorruption laws however there can be no assurance that our thirdparty service providers will adhere to these requirements 

any of these thirdparty service providers however may materially fail to meet its service performance commitments to the company or may suffer disruptions to its systems that could impact its services for example failures in certain thirdparty technology or communications systems may cause flight delays or cancellations the failure of any of the companys thirdparty service providers to perform its service obligations adequately or other interruptions of services may reduce the companys revenues and increase its expenses prevent the company from operating its flights and providing other services to its customers or result in adverse publicity or harm to our brand we may also be subject to consequences from any illegal conduct of our thirdparty service providers including for their failure to comply with anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act in addition the companys business and financial performance could be materially harmed if its customers believe that its services are unreliable or unsatisfactory 

the company may also have disagreements with such providers or such contracts may be terminated or may not be extended or renewed for example the number of flight reservations booked through thirdparty gdss or online travel agents otas may be adversely affected by disruptions in the business relationships between the company and these suppliers such disruptions including a failure to agree upon acceptable contract terms when contracts expire or otherwise become subject to renegotiation may cause the companys flight information to be limited or unavailable for display by the affected gds or ota operator significantly increase fees for both the company and gdsota users and impair the companys relationships with its customers and travel agencies any such disruptions or contract terminations may adversely impact our operations and financial results 

if we are not able to negotiate or renew agreements with thirdparty service providers or if we renew existing agreements on less favorable terms our operations and financial results may be adversely affected 

the company could experience adverse publicity harm to its brand reduced travel demand potential tort liability and voluntary or mandatory operational restrictions as a result of an accident catastrophe or incident involving its aircraft or its operations the aircraft or operations of its regional carriers the aircraft or operations of its codeshare partners or the aircraft or operations of another airline which may result in a material adverse effect on the companys business operating results and financial condition 

an accident catastrophe or incident involving an aircraft that the company operates or an aircraft that is operated by a codeshare partner one of the companys regional carriers or another airline or an incident involving the companys operations or the operations of a codeshare partner one of the companys regional carriers or of another airline could have a material adverse effect on the company if such accident catastrophe or incident created a public perception that the companys operations or the operations of its codeshare partners or regional carriers are not safe or reliable or are less safe or reliable than other airlines additionally any accident catastrophe or incident involving an aircraft type that is operated by the company its codeshare partners or regional carriers could have a material adverse effect on the company if such accident catastrophe or incident creates a public perception that such aircraft type was not safe or reliable further any such accident catastrophe or incident involving the company its regional carriers or its codeshare partners could expose the company to 

significant tort liability although the company currently maintains liability insurance in amounts and of the type the company believes to be consistent with industry practice to cover damages arising from any such accident catastrophe or incident and the companys codeshare partners and regional carriers carry similar insurance and generally indemnify the company for their operations if the companys liability exceeds the applicable policy limits or the ability of another carrier to indemnify it the company could incur substantial losses from an accident catastrophe or incident which may result in a material adverse effect on the companys operating results and financial condition in addition any such accident catastrophe or incident involving the company its regional carriers or its codeshare partners could result in operational restrictions on the company including voluntary or mandatory groundings of aircraft for example the company decided to voluntarily ground its boeing 777 aircraft following certain mechanical failures and the resulting public perceptions of the safety of our operations and the reliability of boeing 777 aircraft could adversely affect our business a prolonged period of time operating a reduced fleet in these circumstances could result in a material adverse effect on the companys operating results and financial condition 

in addition the outbreak and spread of the covid19 pandemic have adversely impacted customer perceptions of the health and safety of travel and these negative perceptions could continue even after the pandemic subsides actual or perceived risk of infection on our flights at airports and during other travelrelated activities has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on the publics perception of us which has harmed and may continue to harm our reputation and business we have incurred and expect that we will continue to incur covid19 related costs as we sanitize aircraft implement additional hygienerelated protocols and take other actions to limit the threat of infection among our employees and passengers and combat negative customer perceptions of the health and safety of travel on our aircraft and at our terminals negative public perceptions could in turn result in adverse publicity for the company cause harm to the companys brand and reduce travel demand on the companys flights or the flights of its codeshare partners or regional carriers 

terrorist attacks international hostilities or other security events or the fear of terrorist attacks or hostilities even if not made directly on the airline industry could negatively affect the company and the airline industry 

terrorist attacks or international hostilities even if not made on or targeted directly at the airline industry or the fear of or the precautions taken in anticipation of such attacks including elevated national threat warnings travel restrictions selective cancellation or redirection of flights and new security regulations could materially and adversely affect the company and the airline industry security events pose a significant risk to our passenger and cargo operations these events could include acts of violence in public areas that we cannot control the companys financial resources may not be sufficient to absorb the adverse effects of any future terrorist attacks international hostilities or other security events any such events could have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition liquidity and operating results in addition due to threats against the aviation industry the company has incurred and may continue to incur significant expenditures to comply with securityrelated requirements to mitigate the threats and ensure the safety of our employees and customers with the need to implement proper security measures and the need to ensure the efficacy and efficiency of security inspection throughput to support the pace of our operations it is unlikely that we will be able to capture all securityrelated costs through increased fares which could adversely affect our operating results 

increasing privacy and data security obligations or a significant data breach may adversely affect the companys business 

in our regular business operations we collect process store and transmit to commercial partners sensitive data including personal information of our customers and employees such as payment processing information and information of our business partners the company depends on the ability to use information we collect to provide our services and operate our business 

the company must manage increasing legislative regulatory and consumer focus on privacy issues and data security in a variety of jurisdictions across the globe for example the eus general data protection regulation imposes significant privacy and data security requirements as well as potential for substantial penalties for noncompliance that have resulted in substantial adverse financial consequences to noncompliant companies also some of the companys commercial partners such as credit card companies have imposed data security standards that the company must meet these standards continue to evolve the company will continue its efforts to meet its privacy and data security obligations however it is possible that certain new obligations or customer expectations may be difficult to meet and could require changes in the companys operating processes and increase the companys costs 

additionally the company must manage evolving cybersecurity risks our network systems and storage applications and those systems and applications maintained by our thirdparty commercial partners such as credit card companies and international airline partners may be subject to attempts to gain unauthorized access breach malfeasance or other system disruptions in some cases it is difficult to anticipate or to detect immediately such incidents and the damage caused thereby in addition as attacks by cybercriminals become more sophisticated frequent and intense the costs of proactive defense measures may increase furthermore the companys remote work arrangements make it more vulnerable to targeted activity from 

cybercriminals and significantly increase the risk of cyberattacks or other security breaches while we continually work to safeguard our internal network systems and applications including through risk assessments system monitoring cybersecurity and data protection security policies processes and technologies and employee awareness and training and require thirdparty security standards there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyberattacks or data breaches 

the loss disclosure misappropriation of or access to sensitive company information customers employees or business partners information or the companys failure to meet its obligations could result in legal claims or proceedings penalties and remediation costs a significant data breach or the companys failure to meet its obligations may adversely affect the companys operations reputation relationships with our business partners business operating results and financial condition 

disruptions to our regional network and united express flights provided by thirdparty regional carriers could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

the company has contractual relationships with various regional carriers to provide regional aircraft service branded as united express these regional operations are an extension of the companys mainline network and complement the companys operations by carrying traffic that connects to mainline service and allows flights to smaller cities that cannot be provided economically with mainline aircraft the companys business and operations are dependent on its regional flight network with regional capacity accounting for approximately 146 of the companys total capacity for the year ended december 31 2020 

although the company has agreements with its regional carriers that include contractually agreed performance metrics each regional carrier is a separately certificated commercial air carrier and the company does not control the operations of these carriers a number of factors may impact the companys regional network including weatherrelated effects and seasonality the significant decline in demand for air travel services resulting from the covid19 pandemic has also materially impacted demand for regional carrier services and as a result the companys utilization of its regional network is significantly reduced and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future as a result we may face claims that we failed to perform certain obligations under our agreements with our regional carriers and may incur damages we expect the disruption to services resulting from the covid19 pandemic to continue to adversely affect our regional carriers some of which may declare bankruptcy or otherwise cease to operate 

in addition the decrease in qualified pilots driven by changes to federal regulations has adversely impacted and could continue to affect the companys regional flying for example the faas expansion of minimum pilot qualification standards including a requirement that a pilot have at least 1500 total flight hours as well as the faas revised pilot flight and duty time requirements under part 117 of the federal aviation regulations have contributed to a smaller supply of pilots available to regional carriers the decrease in qualified pilots resulting from the regulations as well as factors including a decreased student pilot population and a shrinking us military from which to hire qualified pilots could adversely impact the companys operations and financial condition and could also require the company to reduce regional carrier flying 

if as a result of the covid19 pandemic the pilot shortage or another significant disruption to our regional network one or more of the regional carriers with which the company has relationships is unable to perform its obligations over an extended period of time there could be a material adverse effect on the companys business operating results and financial condition in addition although our need for regional carrier services is materially lower than in prior years we may be obligated to make minimum payments under one or more of our contracts with our regional providers that are in excess of the cost of the services we currently require from them 

our significant investments in other airlines including in other parts of the world and the commercial relationships that we have with those carriers may not produce the returns or results we expect 

an important part of our strategy to expand our global network has included making significant investments in airlines both domestically and in other parts of the world and expanding our commercial relationships with these carriers for example in january 2019 we completed the acquisition of a 499 interest in manaair llc manaair which as of immediately following the closing of that investment owns 100 of the equity interests in expressjet we also have minority equity interests in commutair and republic airways holdings inc see note 9 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information regarding our investments in regional airlines we also have significant investments in latin american airlines including significant investments in avianca holdings sa avh and brw aviation llc brw an affiliate of synergy aerospace corporation and the majority shareholder of avh and an equity investment in azul linhas aéreas brasileiras sa azul in the future our regional and global business strategy could include entering into jbas commercial agreements and strategic alliances with other carriers and possibly making loan transactions with and noncontrolling investments in such carriers 

these transactions and relationships involve significant challenges and risks and we face competition in forming and maintaining these relationships since there are a limited number of potential arrangements and other airlines are looking to enter into similar relationships we are dependent on these other carriers for significant aspects of our network in the regions in which they operate while we work closely with these carriers each is a separately certificated commercial air carrier and we do not have control over their operations strategy management or business methods and not only are these airlines subject to a number of the same risks as our business which are described elsewhere in this part i item 1a risk factors including the impact of the covid19 pandemic competitive pressures on pricing demand and capacity changes in aircraft fuel pricing and the impact of global and local political and economic conditions on operations and customer travel patterns among others they are also subject to their own distinct financial and operational risks 

as a result of these and other factors we may not realize satisfactory returns on our investments and we may not receive repayment of any invested or loaned funds further these investments may not generate the revenue or operational synergies we expect and they may distract management focus from our operations or other strategic options finally our reliance on these other carriers in the regions in which they operate may negatively impact our regional and global operations and results if those carriers continue to be impacted by the covid19 pandemic and other general business risks discussed above or perform below our expectations or needs and are not able to effectively mitigate these impacts or restore performance levels any one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition 

we exercised our right to withdraw all aircraft from our capacity purchase agreement with expressjet and as of october 1 2020 expressjet no longer provides regional capacity services to united see notes 9 and 11 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information regarding our investments in avh and azul and our capacity purchase arrangements with expressjet respectively see also the additional risks with respect to our investment in avh which are described elsewhere in this part i item 1a risk factors 

we may also be subject to consequences from any illegal conduct of jba partners including for failure to comply with anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act furthermore our relationships with these carriers may be subject to the laws and regulations of nonus jurisdictions in which these carriers are located or conduct business in addition any political or regulatory change in these jurisdictions that negatively impacts or prohibits our arrangements with these carriers could have an adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition to the extent that the operations of any of these carriers are disrupted over an extended period of time including as a result of the covid19 pandemic or their actions subject us to the consequences of failure to comply with laws and regulations our operating results may be adversely affected 

our significant investments in avh and its affiliates and the commercial relationships that we have with avianca may not produce the returns or results we expect 

in november 2018 as part of our global network strategy united entered into a revenuesharing jba with avianca a subsidiary of avh copa and several of their respective affiliates subject to regulatory approval concurrently with this transaction united as lender entered into a term loan agreement the brw term loan agreement with among others brw aviation holding llc brw holding and brw as guarantor and borrower respectively pursuant to the brw term loan agreement united provided to brw a 456 million term loan the brw term loan secured by a pledge of brws equity as well as brws 516 million common shares of avh which can be converted and exchanged into 645 million american depositary receipts adrs of avh such shares and equity collectively the brw loan collateral in connection with funding the brw term loan agreement the company entered into an agreement with kingsland holdings limited avhs largest minority shareholder kingsland pursuant to which united granted to kingsland a right to put its avh common shares to united at market price on the fifth anniversary of the brw term loan agreement or upon certain sales of avh common shares owned by brw including upon a foreclosure of uniteds security interest or any completed liquidation or dissolution of avh and also guaranteed brws obligation to pay kingsland the excess if any of 12 per adr on the nyse and such market price of avh common shares on the fifth anniversary or upon any such sale as applicable the cooperation payment for an aggregate maximum possible combined put payment and guarantee amount of 217 million see notes 8 and 13 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information regarding our obligations to kingsland and their interrelationship with the brw term loan agreement 

brw is currently in default under the brw term loan agreement and since may 2019 united has been exercising certain remedies under the terms of the brw term loan agreement and related documents in september 2019 a new york state court granted summary judgment authorizing the foreclosure on the brw loan collateral and enjoined brw holding from interfering with the ability of kingsland as uniteds agent to exercise voting and other rights in certain equity interests in brw these rulings are intermediate steps in the judicial foreclosure process in new york and are being appealed the timing and outcome of the judicial foreclosure process is subject to significant uncertainty given the filing by avh and certain of its affiliates of voluntary reorganization proceedings under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code in the us 

bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york the bankruptcy court on may 10 2020 as described in more detail below the avh reorganization proceedings in light of the avh reorganization proceedings the new york state court judge presiding over the foreclosure proceedings agreed to stay those proceedings until march 2021 based on uniteds assessment of avhs financial uncertainty and the fact that avianca had ceased operations as a consequence of the covid19 pandemic during the first quarter of 2020 the company recorded a 697 million expected credit loss allowance for the brw term loan and the cooperation payment 

in 2019 united entered into a senior secured convertible term loan agreement the avh convertible loan agreement with among others avh as borrower and pursuant thereto provided a convertible term loan to avh in the aggregate amount of 150 million the avh convertible loan 

see notes 8 and 13 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information regarding our investments in avh and its affiliates and our guarantee of the cooperation payment respectively 

in october 2020 avh consummated a 2 billion debtorinpossession financing the avh dip financing the avh convertible loan was refinanced or rolled up into the avh dip financing without any investment of new funds by united and as a result united is a tranche b dip lender in the avh dip financing to the extent of the principal and interest owed on the avh convertible loan or less under certain circumstances uniteds tranche b loan accrues interest at a rate of 145 per annum and can be converted at avhs option in certain circumstances into equity upon avhs exit from bankruptcy as part of the avh dip financing the bankruptcy court also approved certain amendments to the alliance agreement and certain related agreements among united avianca and some of aviancas subsidiaries and additional arrangements among those parties applicable to whether avh accepts or rejects the jba at or prior to the end of the bankruptcy case there is no guarantee that uniteds participation in the avh dip financing will produce the results expected or result in the ultimate repayment to united of the amounts initially loaned under the avh convertible loan while uniteds position as an avh dip financing lender provides it with priority secured claims and liens that have been approved by the bankruptcy court the duration of the avh reorganization proceedings is difficult to predict and uniteds recovery on its claims including possibly repayment or conversion of its tranche b dip loans may be adversely affected by among other things delays while a plan of reorganization is being negotiated and approved by creditors entitled to vote on it and whether such plan or reorganization is confirmed by the bankruptcy court and subsequently becomes effective 

these transactions and relationships involve significant challenges and risks particularly given the avh reorganization proceedings the impact of the covid19 pandemic and the judicial foreclosure process to which the repayment of the brw term loan is subject furthermore while we have worked closely with avianca in connection with the jba and have supported avh by providing capital in the form of the avh convertible loan and then the avh dip financing avianca is a separately certificated commercial air carrier and we do not have control over its or avhs operations strategy management or business methods avianca is also subject to a number of the same risks as our business which are described elsewhere in this part i item 1a risk factors as updated by this report including the impact of the covid19 pandemic competitive pressures on pricing demand and capacity changes in aircraft fuel pricing and the impact of global and local political and economic conditions on operations and customer travel patterns among others as well as to its own distinct financial and operational risks 

as a result of these and other factors including the avh reorganization proceedings and delays in foreclosure proceedings we may not receive full or any repayment of our brw term loan including any payment we make in respect of the cooperation payment our avh convertible loan or our participation in the avh dip financing and we may be unable to realize the full or any value of the brw loan collateral or the collateral securing the avh convertible loan or the avh dip financing as applicable as a consequence we may not realize a satisfactory or any return on our invested or loaned funds with respect to brw avh and its affiliates 

further these investments may not generate the revenue or operational synergies we expect and they may distract management focus from our operations or other strategic options finally our reliance on avianca in the region in which it operates may negatively impact our global operations and results if avh does not successfully emerge from the avh reorganization proceedings or the covid19 pandemic if the jba is rejected in connection with the avh reorganization proceedings or if avh is otherwise impacted by general business risks or performs below our expectations or needs any one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition 

the airline industry may undergo further change with respect to alliances and jbas or due to consolidations any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company 

the company faces and may continue to face strong competition from other carriers due to the modification of alliances and formation of new jbas carriers may improve their competitive positions through airline alliances slot swaps andor jbas certain types of airline jbas further competition by allowing multiple airlines to coordinate routes pool revenues 

and costs and enjoy other mutual benefits achieving many of the benefits of consolidation open skies agreements including the longstanding agreements between the united states and each of the eu canada japan korea new zealand australia colombia and panama as well as the more recent agreements between the united states and each of mexico and brazil may also give rise to better integration opportunities among international carriers movement of airlines between current global airline alliances could reduce joint network coverage for members of such alliances while also creating opportunities for jbas and bilateral alliances that did not exist before such realignment further airline and airline alliance consolidations or reorganizations could occur in the future the company routinely engages in analyses and discussions regarding its own strategic position including current and potential alliances asset acquisitions and divestitures and may have future discussions with other airlines regarding strategic activities if other airlines participate in such activities those airlines may significantly improve their cost structures or revenue generation capabilities thereby potentially making them stronger competitors of the company and potentially impairing the companys ability to realize expected benefits from its own strategic relationships 

orders for new aircraft typically must be placed years in advance of scheduled deliveries and changes in the companys network strategy over time or other factors outside of the companys control may make aircraft on order less economic for the company result in costs related to modification or termination of aircraft orders or cause the company to enter into orders for new aircraft on less favorable terms 

the companys orders for new aircraft are typically made years in advance of actual delivery of such aircraft and the financial commitment required for purchases of new aircraft is substantial as of february 2021 the company had firm commitments to purchase 298 new aircraft from the boeing company boeing airbus sas airbus and embraer sa embraer as well as related agreements with engine manufacturers maintenance providers and others as of february 2021 the companys commitments relating to the acquisition of aircraft and related spare engines aircraft improvements and other related obligations aggregated to a total of approximately 243 billion 

subsequent to the company placing an order for new aircraft the companys network strategy may change as a result the companys preference for a particular aircraft that it has ordered often years in advance may be decreased or eliminated if the company were to modify or terminate any of its existing aircraft order commitments it may be responsible for material liabilities to its counterparties arising from any such modification additionally the company may have a need for additional aircraft that are not available under its existing orders in such cases the company may seek to acquire aircraft from other sources such as through lease arrangements which may result in higher costs or less favorable terms or through the purchase or lease of used aircraft the company may not be able to acquire such aircraft when needed on favorable terms or at all 

the imposition of new tariffs or any increase in existing tariffs on the importation of commercial aircraft that the company orders may result in higher costs for example in october 2019 the united states imposed tariffs on certain imports from the eu including a customs duty at an ad valorem rate of 10 on new commercial aircraft which rate in february 2020 was increased to 15 these tariffs apply to certain new airbus aircraft that we have on order additionally in december 2020 the united states imposed tariffs on certain aircraft components from france and germany while the scope and rate of these tariffs are subject to change if and to the extent these tariffs are imposed on us they could increase the effective cost of among other things new airbus aircraft and aircraft components 

a majority of the companys aircraft and certain parts are sourced from single suppliers therefore the company would be materially and adversely affected if it were unable to obtain timely deliveries additional equipment or support from any of these suppliers 

the company currently sources the majority of its aircraft and many related aircraft parts from boeing in addition our aircraft suppliers are dependent on other suppliers for certain other aircraft parts therefore if the company is unable to acquire additional aircraft from boeing or if boeing fails to make timely deliveries of aircraft or to provide adequate support for its products the companys operations could be materially and adversely affected the company is also dependent on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft engines and certain other aircraft parts and could therefore also be materially and adversely affected in the event of the unavailability of these engines and other parts 

union disputes employee strikes or slowdowns and other laborrelated disruptions could adversely affect the companys operations and could result in increased costs that impair its financial performance 

united is a highly unionized company as of december 31 2020 the company and its subsidiaries had approximately 74400 employees of whom approximately 84 were represented by various us labor organizations see part i item 1 business—human capital of this report for additional information on our represented employee groups and collective bargaining agreements 

there is a risk that unions or individual employees might pursue judicial or arbitral claims arising out of changes implemented as a result of the company entering into collective bargaining agreements with its represented employee groups there is also a possibility that employees or unions could engage in job actions such as slowdowns worktorule campaigns sickouts or other actions designed to disrupt the companys normal operations in an attempt to pressure the company in collective bargaining negotiations although the rla makes such actions unlawful until the parties have been lawfully released to selfhelp and the company can seek injunctive relief against premature selfhelp such actions can cause significant harm even if ultimately enjoined similarly if the operations of our thirdparty regional carriers ground handlers or other vendors are impacted by laborrelated disruptions our operations could be adversely affected in addition collective bargaining agreements with the companys represented employee groups increase the companys labor costs which increase could be material 

extended interruptions or disruptions in service at major airports where we operate could have a material adverse impact on our operations 

the airline industry is heavily dependent on business models that concentrate operations in major airports in the united states and throughout the world an extended interruption or disruption at an airport where we have significant operations could have a material impact on our business financial condition and results of operation 

we operate principally through our domestic hubs in newark chicago ohare denver houston bush lax guam sfo and washington dulles substantially all of our flights either originate in or fly into one of these locations a significant interruption or disruption in service at one of our hubs or other airports where we have a significant presence resulting from atc delays weather conditions natural disasters growth constraints relations with thirdparty service providers failure of computer systems disruptions to government agencies or personnel including as a result of government shutdowns disruptions at airport facilities or other key facilities used by us to manage our operations labor relations power supplies fuel supplies terrorist activities international hostilities or otherwise could result in the cancellation or delay of a significant portion of our flights and as a result could have a material impact on our business operating results and financial condition we have minimal control over the operation quality or maintenance of these services or whether vendors will improve or continue to provide services that are essential to our business 

the united kingdoms withdrawal from the eu may adversely impact our operations in the united kingdom and elsewhere 

on january 31 2020 the united kingdom uk withdrew from the eu and started a transition period that ran through december 31 2020 during that time the eu and uk negotiated a comprehensive trade agreement that provisionally went into effect on january 1 2021 the agreement includes an aviation chapter that preserves euuk air connectivity 

in connection with the uks exit from the eu we could face new challenges in our operations such as instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets this instability could result in market volatility including in the value of the british pound and european euro additional travel restrictions on passengers traveling between the uk and eu countries changes to the legal status of euresident employees legal uncertainty and divergent national laws and regulations at this time we cannot predict the precise impact that the uks exit from the eu will have on our business generally and our uk and european operations more specifically and no assurance can be given that our operating results financial condition and prospects would not be adversely impacted by the result 

the companys operating results fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors associated with the airline industry many of which are beyond the companys control 

due to greater demand for air travel during the spring and summer months revenues in the airline industry in the second and third quarters of the year are generally stronger than revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year which are periods of lower travel demand the companys operating results generally reflect this seasonality but have also been impacted by numerous other factors that are not necessarily seasonal including among others extreme or severe weather outbreaks of disease or pandemics atc congestion geological events political instability terrorism natural disasters changes in the competitive environment due to industry consolidation tax obligations general economic conditions and other factors as a result the companys quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year and historical operating results in a quarterly or annual period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 

the company may never realize the full value of its intangible assets or its longlived assets causing it to record impairments that may negatively affect its financial condition and operating results 

in accordance with applicable accounting standards the company is required to test its indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently where there is an indication of impairment in addition the company is required to test certain of its other assets for impairment where there is any indication that an asset may be impaired 

the company may be required to recognize losses in the future due to among other factors extreme fuel price volatility tight credit markets government regulatory changes decline in the fair values of certain tangible or intangible assets such as aircraft route authorities airport slots and frequent flyer database unfavorable trends in historical or forecasted results of operations and cash flows and an uncertain economic environment as well as other uncertainties for example in 2020 the company recorded impairment charges of 130 million for its china routes primarily as a result of the covid19 pandemic and the companys subsequent suspension of flights to china 38 million for its rightofuse asset associated with an embedded aircraft lease under a cpa primarily as a result of reduced cash flows from the covid19 pandemic and 94 million related to certain of the companys fleet of boeing 757 aircraft and 56 million with respect to various cancelled facility aircraft induction and information technology capital projects as a result of the covid19 pandemics impact on our operations in addition in 2019 the company recorded impairment charges of 90 million associated with its hong kong routes resulting in the full impairment of these assets the company can provide no assurance that a material impairment loss of tangible or intangible assets will not occur in a future period the value of the companys aircraft could be impacted in future periods by changes in supply and demand for these aircraft such changes in supply and demand for certain aircraft types could result from the grounding of aircraft an impairment loss could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition and operating results 

any damage to our reputation or brand image could adversely affect our business or financial results 

we operate in a publicfacing industry and maintaining a good reputation is critical to our business the companys reputation or brand image could be adversely impacted by any failure to maintain satisfactory practices for all of our operations and activities any failure to achieve andor make progress toward our environmental and sustainability and diversity equity and inclusion goals public pressure from investors or policy groups to change our policies customer perceptions of our advertising campaigns sponsorship arrangements or marketing programs customer perceptions of our use of social media or customer perceptions of statements made by us our employees and executives agents or other third parties damage to our reputation or brand image or loss of customer confidence in our services could adversely affect our business and financial results as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation 

the companys ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes to offset future taxable income for us federal income tax purposes may be significantly limited due to various circumstances including certain possible future transactions involving the sale or issuance of ual common stock or if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels 

as of december 31 2020 ual reported consolidated us federal net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately 110 billion 

the companys ability to use its nol carryforwards and certain other tax attributes will depend on the amount of taxable income it generates in future periods as a result certain of the companys nol carryforwards and other tax attributes may expire before it can generate sufficient taxable income to use them in full 

in addition the companys ability to use its nol carryforwards and certain other tax attributes to offset future taxable income may be limited if it experiences an ownership change as defined in section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended section 382 an ownership change generally occurs if certain stockholders increase their aggregate percentage ownership of a corporations stock by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest percentage ownership at any time during the testing period which is generally the threeyear period preceding any potential ownership change 

in general a corporation that experiences an ownership change will be subject to an annual limitation on its preownership change nols and certain other tax attribute carryforwards equal to the value of the corporations stock immediately before the ownership change multiplied by the applicable longterm taxexempt rate posted by the irs any unused annual limitation may subject to certain limits be carried over to later years and the limitation may under certain circumstances be increased by builtin gains in the assets held by such corporation at the time of the ownership change this limitation could cause the companys us federal income taxes to be greater or to be paid earlier than they otherwise would be and could cause a portion of the companys nols and certain other tax attributes to expire unused similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes 

for purposes of determining whether there has been an ownership change the change in ownership as a result of purchases by 5percent shareholders will be aggregated with certain changes in ownership that occurred over the threeyear period ending on the date of such purchases  potential future transactions involving the sale or issuance of ual common stock may increase the possibility that the company will experience a future ownership change under section 382 such transactions may include the exercise of warrants issued in connection with the cares act programs the issuance of ual common stock upon the conversion of any convertible debt that ual may issue in the future the repurchase of any debt with ual common stock any issuance of ual common stock for cash and the acquisition or disposition of any stock by a stockholder owning 5 

or more of the outstanding shares of ual common stock or a combination of the foregoing if we were to experience an ownership change it is possible that the companys nols and certain other tax attribute carryforwards could expire before we would be able to use them to offset future income tax obligations 

on december 4 2020 the board of directors of the company adopted a tax benefits preservation plan the plan in order to preserve the companys ability to use its nols and certain other tax attributes to reduce potential future income tax obligations the plan is designed to reduce the likelihood that the company experiences an ownership change by deterring certain acquisitions of company securities there is no assurance however that the deterrent mechanism will be effective and such acquisitions may still occur in addition the plan may adversely affect the marketability of ual common stock by discouraging existing or potential investors from acquiring ual common stock or additional shares of ual common stock because any nonexempt third party that acquires 49 or more of the thenoutstanding shares of ual common stock would suffer substantial dilution of its ownership interest in the company 

risks relating to legal and regulatory compliance 

the airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation which imposes significant costs and may adversely impact our business operating results and financial condition 

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal oversight compliance with us and international regulations imposes significant costs and may have adverse effects on the company laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges both domestically and internationally have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce airline revenue the airline industry is heavily taxed and additional taxation could negatively impact our business 

united provides air transportation under certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by the dot if the dot altered amended modified suspended or revoked these certificates it could have a material adverse effect on the companys business the dot also regulates consumer protection and through its investigations or rulemaking authority could impose restrictions that materially impact the companys business the faa regulates the safety of uniteds operations united operates pursuant to an air carrier operating certificate issued by the faa the faas regulations include stringent pilot flight and duty time requirements under part 117 of the federal aviation regulations as well as minimum qualifications for air carrier first officers from time to time the faa also issues orders airworthiness directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require material expenditures or operational restrictions by the company these faa orders and directives have resulted in the temporary grounding of an entire aircraft type if the faa identifies design manufacturing maintenance or other issues requiring immediate corrective action including the faa order grounding boeing 737 max aircraft these faa directives or requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company 

in 2018 the us congress approved a fiveyear reauthorization for the faa which encompasses significant aviation tax and policyrelated issues the law includes a range of policy changes related to airline customer service and aviation safety implementation of some items continues into the new administration and depending on how they are implemented could impact our operations and costs us congressional action in response to the covid19 pandemic has provided funding for us airlines in both grants and loans the us congress has imposed limited conditions on airlines accepting funding including workforce retention and minimum service requirements with the change in control of the us congress and a new presidential administration any future funding or other pandemic relief could include additional requirements that could impact our operations and costs additionally the us congress may consider legislation related to environmental issues or increases to the us federal corporate income tax rate which could impact the company and the airline industry 

the companys operations may also be adversely impacted due to the existing antiquated atc system utilized by the us government and regulated by the faa during peak travel periods in certain markets the current atc systems inability to handle demand has led to shortterm capacity constraints imposed by government agencies and resulted in delays and disruptions of air traffic in addition the current system will not be able to effectively handle projected future air traffic growth the outdated technologies also cause the atc to be less resilient in the event of a failure causing flight cancellations and delays imposition of these atc constraints on a longterm basis may have a material adverse effect on the companys operations failure to update the atc system in a timely manner and the substantial funding requirements of a modernized atc system that may be imposed on air carriers may have an adverse impact on the companys financial condition or operating results 

access to landing and takeoff rights or slots at several major us airports and many foreign airports served by the company are or recently have been subject to government regulation certain of the companys major hubs are among the most congested airports in the united states and have been or could be the subject of regulatory action that might limit the number of flights andor increase costs of operations at certain times or throughout the day the dot including faa may limit the companys airport access by limiting the number of departure and arrival slots at high density traffic airports which 

could affect the companys ownership and transfer rights and local airport authorities may have the ability to control access to certain facilities or the cost of access to their facilities which could have an adverse effect on the companys business the dot historically has taken actions with respect to airlines slot holdings that airlines have challenged if the dot were to take actions that adversely affect the companys slot holdings the company could incur substantial costs to preserve its slots or may lose slots if slots are eliminated at an airport or if the number of hours of operation governed by slots is reduced at an airport the lack of controls on takeoffs and landings could result in greater congestion both at the affected airport or in the regional airspace eg the new york city metropolitan region airspace and could significantly impact the companys operations in addition as airports around the world become more congested space facility and infrastructure constraints may prevent the company from maintaining existing service andor implementing new service in a commercially viable manner further the companys operating costs at airports including the companys major hubs may increase significantly because of capital improvements at such airports that the company may be required to fund directly or indirectly such costs could be imposed by the relevant airport authority without the companys approval and may have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition because of airport infrastructure updates and other factors the company has experienced increased space rental rates at various airports in its network further the company cannot control decisions by other airlines to reduce their capacity when this occurs certain fixed airport costs are allocated among fewer total flights which can result in increased landing fees and other costs for the company in light of constraints on existing facilities there is presently a significant amount of capital spending underway at major airports in the united states including large projects underway at a number of airports where we have significant operations such as chicago ohare international airport ord los angeles international airport lax laguardia airport lga and ronald reagan washington national airport dca this spending is expected to result in increased costs to airlines and the traveling public that use those facilities as the airports seek to recover their investments through increased rental landing and other facility costs in some circumstances such costs could be imposed by the relevant airport authority without our approval accordingly our operating costs are expected to increase significantly at many airports at which we operate including a number of our hubs and gateways as a result of capital spending projects currently underway and additional projects that we expect to commence over the next several years 

the ability of carriers to operate flights on international routes between the united states and other countries is highly regulated applicable arrangements between the united states and foreign governments may be amended from time to time government policies with respect to airport operations may be revised and the availability of appropriate slots or facilities may change the company currently operates a number of flights on international routes under government arrangements regulations or policies that designate the number of carriers permitted to operate on such routes the capacity of the carriers providing services on such routes the airports at which carriers may operate international flights or the number of carriers allowed access to particular airports in addition the pandemic has resulted in and created the potential for increased regulatory burdens in the us and around the globe these include but are not limited to closure of international borders to flights andor passengers from specific countries passenger and crew quarantine requirements and other regulations promulgated to protect public health but that have a negative impact on travel and airline operations any limitations additions or modifications to such arrangements regulations or policies could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition and operating results additionally a change in law regulation or policy for any of the companys international routes such as open skies could have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition and operating results and could result in the impairment of material amounts of related tangible and intangible assets in addition competition from revenuesharing jbas and other alliance arrangements by and among other airlines could impair the value of the companys business and assets on the open skies routes the companys plans to enter into or expand us antitrust immunized alliances and jbas on various international routes are subject to receipt of approvals from applicable us federal authorities and obtaining other applicable foreign government clearances or satisfying the necessary applicable regulatory requirements there can be no assurance that such approvals and clearances will be granted or will continue in effect upon further regulatory review or that changes in regulatory requirements or standards can be satisfied

we are subject to many forms of environmental regulation and liability and risks associated with climate change and may incur substantial costs as a result 

many aspects of the companys operations are subject to increasingly stringent federal state local and international laws protecting the environment including those relating to emissions to the air water discharges safe drinking water the use and management of hazardous materials and wastes and noise emissions compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures and violations can lead to significant fines and penalties in addition from time to time we are identified as a responsible party for environmental investigation and remediation costs under applicable environmental laws due to the disposal of hazardous substances generated by our operations we could also be subject to environmental liability claims from various parties including airport authorities related to our operations at our owned or leased premises or the offsite disposal of waste generated at our facilities 

we may incur substantial costs as a result of changes in weather patterns due to climate change increases in the frequency severity or duration of severe weather events such as thunderstorms hurricanes flooding typhoons tornados and other severe weather events could result in increases in delays and cancellations turbulencerelated injuries and fuel consumption to avoid such weather any of which could result in significant loss of revenue and higher costs in addition we could incur significant costs to improve the climate resiliency of our infrastructure and supply chain and otherwise prepare for respond to and mitigate the effects of climate change we are not able to predict accurately the materiality of any potential losses or costs associated with the effects of climate change 

to mitigate climate change risks corsia has been developed by icao a un specialized agency corsia is intended to create a single global marketbased measure to achieve carbonneutral growth for international aviation after 2020 through airline purchases of carbon offset credits the voluntary pilot and first phases of the program are expected to run from 2021 through 2023 and 2024 through 2026 respectively with airlines having until january 2025 to cancel eligible emissions units to comply with their total offsetting requirements for the pilot phase certain corsia program aspects could potentially be affected by the results of the pilot phase of the program and thus the impact of corsia cannot be fully predicted however corsia is expected to result in increased operating costs for airlines that operate internationally including the company 

in addition to corsia in december 2020 the epa adopted its own aircraft and aircraft engine ghg emissions standards which are aligned with the 2017 icao airplane carbon dioxide emission standards other jurisdictions in which united operates have adopted or are considering ghg emissions reduction initiatives which could impact various aspects of the companys business while the company has voluntarily pledged to reduce 100 of our ghg emissions by 2050 the precise nature of future requirements and their applicability to the company are difficult to predict and the financial impact to the company and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant if they vary significantly from the companys own plans and strategy with respect to reducing ghg emissions

continued restrictions on the use of the boeing 737 max aircraft and the inability to accept or integrate new aircraft into our fleet as planned may have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

on march 13 2019 the faa issued an emergency order prohibiting the operation of boeing 737 max series aircraft by us certificated operators the faa order as a result the company grounded all 14 boeing 737 max 9 aircraft in its fleet and boeing also suspended deliveries of new boeing 737 max series aircraft on november 18 2020 the faa announced that it had rescinded the faa order and cleared the 737 max aircraft to fly again after a 20month review and certification process while several countries following the faas lead have lifted the grounding of the boeing 737 max aircraft other countries have delayed their expected approval of the aircraft until later in 2021 there are also many countries such as china that have no current plans to lift the aircrafts grounding and may not do so in the foreseeable future 

in 2019 the grounding affected the delivery of 16 boeing 737 max aircraft that were scheduled for delivery in 2019 and were not delivered and it also affected the timing of future boeing 737 max aircraft deliveries including the boeing 737 max aircraft of which the company planned to take delivery in 2020 the extent of the delay of future deliveries is expected to be impacted by boeings production rate and the pace at which boeing can deliver aircraft among other factors and these factors have been and could continue to be significantly impacted by the covid19 pandemic if for any reason we are unable to accept deliveries of new aircraft or integrate such new aircraft into our fleet as planned we may face higher financing and operating costs than planned or be required to seek extensions of the terms for certain leased aircraft or otherwise delay the exit of other aircraft from our fleet such unanticipated extensions or delays may require us to operate existing aircraft beyond the point at which it is economically optimal to retire them resulting in increased maintenance costs or reductions to our schedule thereby reducing revenues 

in response to the grounding of the boeing 737 max aircraft the company made adjustments to its flight schedule and operations including substituting replacement aircraft on routes originally intended to be flown by boeing 737 max aircraft in 2019 and early 2020 the grounding impacted the companys ability to implement its strategic growth strategy reducing the companys scheduled capacity from its planned capacity and resulted in increased costs as well as lower operating revenue continued restrictions on the use of boeing 737 max aircraft in other countries could impact the aircrafts optimal use in our network furthermore in 2021 like 2020 demand has been and is expected to continue to be significantly impacted by covid19 which in addition to the previous grounding of the boeing 737 max aircraft has materially disrupted the timely execution of our plans to add capacity in 2021 the company had discussions with boeing regarding compensation from boeing for the companys financial damages related to the grounding of the airlines boeing 737 max aircraft and in march 2020 the company entered into a confidential settlement with boeing with respect to compensation for financial damages incurred in 2019 the settlement agreement was amended and restated in june 2020 to provide for the settlement of additional 

items related to aircraft delivery and to update the scheduled delivery for substantially all undelivered boeing 737 max aircraft 

risks relating to our indebtedness 

the company has a significant amount of financial leverage from fixed obligations and may seek material amounts of additional financial liquidity in the shortterm and insufficient liquidity may have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition and business 

the company has a significant amount of financial leverage from fixed obligations including aircraft lease and debt financings leases of airport property secured loan facilities and other facilities and other material cash obligations in addition the company has substantial noncancelable commitments for capital expenditures including for the acquisition of new and used aircraft and related spare engines 

in addition in response to the travel restrictions and advisories decreased demand and other effects the covid19 pandemic has had and is expected to have on the companys business the company may continue to seek material amounts of additional financial liquidity in the shortterm which may include additional drawings of loans under the loan program of the cares act the issuance of additional unsecured or secured debt securities equity securities and equitylinked securities the sale of assets as well as additional bilateral and syndicated secured andor unsecured credit facilities among other items 

there can be no assurance as to the timing of any such incurrence or issuance which may be in the near term or that any such additional financing will be completed on favorable terms or at all as of december 31 2020 we had total longterm debt of 267 billion approximately 70 billion available for borrowing under the loan program under the cares act and 10 billion available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility 

the companys substantial level of indebtedness the companys noninvestment grade credit ratings and the availability of company assets as collateral for loans or other indebtedness which available collateral has been reduced as a result of cares act loan program borrowings may make it difficult for the company to raise additional capital if needed to meet its liquidity needs on acceptable terms or at all 

although the companys cash flows from operations and its available capital including the proceeds from financing transactions have been sufficient to meet its obligations and commitments to date the companys liquidity has been and may in the future be negatively affected by the risk factors discussed elsewhere in this part i item 1a risk f actors  including risks related to future results arising from the covid19 pandemic if the companys liquidity is materially diminished the companys cash flow available for general corporate purposes may be materially and adversely affected in particular with respect to the 68 billion of senior secured notes and a secured term loan facility the mileageplus financing secured by substantially all of the assets of mileage plus holdings llc a direct whollyowned subsidiary of united mph and mileage plus intellectual property assets ltd an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of mph mipa the cash flows generated by the mileageplus business are required to first satisfy interest and principal due thereunder therefore the cash generated by the mileageplus program is not fully available for our operations or to satisfy our other indebtedness obligations for the sevenyear term of the mileageplus financing debt this limitation on our cash flows could have a material adverse effect on our operations and flexibility 

a material reduction in the companys liquidity could also result in the company not being able to timely pay its leases and debts or comply with material provisions of its contractual obligations including covenants under its financing and credit card processing agreements moreover as a result of the companys financing activities in response to the covid19 pandemic the number of financings with respect to which such covenants and provisions apply has increased thereby subjecting the company to more substantial risk of default crossdefault and crossacceleration in the event of breach and additional covenants and provisions could become binding on the company as it continues to seek additional liquidity in addition several of the companys debt agreements contain covenants that among other things restrict the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness the company has agreements with financial institutions that process customer credit card transactions for the sale of air travel and other services under certain of the companys credit card processing agreements the financial institutions in certain circumstances have the right to require that the company maintain a reserve equal to a portion or potentially all of advance ticket sales that have been processed by that financial institution but for which the company has not yet provided the air transportation such financial institutions may require cash or other collateral reserves to be established or withholding of payments related to receivables to be collected including if the company does not maintain certain minimum levels of unrestricted cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments in light of the effect covid19 is having on demand and in turn capacity the company has seen an increase in demand from consumers for refunds on their tickets and we anticipate some level of increased demand for refunds on tickets will continue to be the case for the near future refunds lower our liquidity and put us at risk of triggering liquidity covenants in these processing agreements and in doing so could force us to post cash collateral with the credit card companies for advance ticket sales the company 

also maintains certain insurance and suretyrelated agreements under which counterparties have required and may require additional collateral 

in addition to the foregoing the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to holders of our securities including the following 

• we must dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on applicable indebtedness which in turn reduces funds available for operations and capital expenditures 

• our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in the markets in which we compete may be limited 

• we may be at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less indebtedness 

• we are rendered more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• we are exposed to increased interest rate risk given that a portion of our indebtedness obligations are at variable interest rates and 

• our credit ratings may be reduced and our debt and equity securities may significantly decrease in value 

finally as of december 31 2020 the company had 95 billion in variable rate indebtedness all or a portion of which uses london interbank offered rates libor as a benchmark for establishing applicable rates as most recently announced in november 30 2020 libor is expected to be phased out starting on january 1 2022 for the oneweek and twomonth usd libor settings and starting on july 1 2023 for the remaining usd libor settings although many of our liborbased obligations provide for alternative methods of calculating the interest rate payable if libor is not reported the extent and manner of any future changes with respect to methods of calculating libor or replacing libor with another benchmark are unknown and impossible to predict at this time and as such may result in interest rates that are materially higher than current interest rates if interest rates applicable to the companys variable interest indebtedness increase the companys interest expense will also increase which could make it difficult for the company to make interest payments and fund other fixed costs and in turn adversely impact our cash flow available for general corporate purposes 

see part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report for additional information regarding the companys liquidity as of december 31 2020 

if we are not able to comply with the covenants in the mileageplus financing agreements our lenders could accelerate the mileageplus indebtedness foreclose upon the collateral securing the mileageplus indebtedness or exercise other remedies which would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the covenants in the agreements governing the mileageplus financing contain a number of provisions that limit our ability to modify aspects of the mileageplus program if such modifications would be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on the mileageplus program or on our ability to pay the obligations under the mileageplus financing agreements moreover the terms of such agreements also place certain restrictions on our establishing or owning another mileage or loyalty program and our ability to make material modifications to our agreements with certain mileageplus partners furthermore the mileageplus financing may also negatively affect certain material business relationships and if any such relationship were to be materially impaired andor terminated we could experience a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

the agreements governing the mileageplus financing restrict our ability to terminate or modify the intercompany agreements governing the relationship between united and the mileageplus program including the agreement governing the rate that united must pay mph for the purchase of miles and uniteds obligation to make certain seat inventory available to mph for redemption such restrictions are in addition to restrictions on the ability of the obligors under the mileageplus indebtedness to make restricted payments incur additional indebtedness dispose of create or incur certain liens on or transfer or convey the collateral securing the mileageplus indebtedness enter into certain transactions with affiliates merge consolidate or sell assets or designate certain subsidiaries as unrestricted complying with these covenants may restrict our ability to make material changes to the operation of the mph business and may limit our ability to take advantage of business opportunities that may be in our longterm interest we may also take actions or omit to take actions to comply with such covenants that could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 

our failure to comply with any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the agreements governing the mileageplus financing which could lead to an acceleration of the debt under such instruments and in some cases the acceleration of debt under other instruments that contain crossdefault or crossacceleration provisions each of which could have a material adverse effect on us in the case of an event of default under the agreements governing the mileageplus financing agreements or a crossdefault or crossacceleration under our other indebtedness we may not have sufficient funds available to make the required payments if we are unable to repay amounts owed under the agreements governing the 

mileageplus financing the lenders or noteholders thereunder may choose to exercise their remedies in respect of the collateral securing such indebtedness including foreclosing upon the mileageplus collateral in which case we would lose the right to operate the mileageplus program thereafter the exercise of such remedies especially the loss of the mileageplus program would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in connection with the mileageplus financing we were required to contribute certain assets including certain mileageplus intellectual property including brands and member data to mileage plus intellectual property assets ltd an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of mph structured to be bankruptcy remote that serves as a coissuer of the mileageplus financing indebtedness the assets of which subsidiary are collateral for such indebtedness united and mph will have the right to use the contributed intellectual property pursuant to a license agreement with mipa such license agreement will be terminated and our right to use such intellectual property will cease upon specified termination events including but not limited to our failure to assume the license agreement and various related intercompany agreements in a restructuring process the termination of the license agreement would be an event of default under the agreements governing the mileageplus financing and in certain circumstances would trigger a liquidated damages payment in an amount that is several multiples of the principal amount of the mileageplus financing debt thus the terms of the mileageplus financing limit our flexibility to manage our capital structure going forward and as a result in the future we may take actions to ensure that the mileageplus financing debt is satisfied or that the lenders remedies under such debt are not exercised potentially to the detriment of our other creditors 

agreements governing our other debt include financial and other covenants failure to comply with these covenants could result in events of default 

in addition to the covenants in the mileageplus financing agreements discussed above our other financing agreements include various financial and other covenants certain of these covenants require ual or united as applicable to maintain minimum liquidity andor minimum collateral coverage ratios uals or uniteds ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond its control including the overall industry revenue environment the level of fuel costs and the appraised value of the collateral in addition our financing agreements contain other negative covenants customary for such financings these covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications if we fail to comply with these covenants and are unable to remedy or obtain a waiver or amendment an event of default would result 

if an event of default were to occur the lenders could among other things declare outstanding amounts immediately due and payable in addition an event of default or declaration of acceleration under one financing agreement could also result in an event of default under other of our financing agreements due to crossdefault and crossacceleration provisions the acceleration of significant amounts of debt could require us to renegotiate repay or refinance the obligations under our financing arrangements 

general risk factors 

if we experience changes in or are unable to retain our senior management team or other key employees our operating results could be adversely affected 

much of our future success depends on the continued availability of skilled personnel with industry experience and knowledge including our senior management team and other key employees if we are unable to attract and retain talented highly qualified senior management and other key employees or if we are unable to effectively provide for the succession of senior management our business may be adversely affected 

current or future litigation and regulatory actions or failure to comply with the terms of any settlement order or arrangement relating to these actions could have a material adverse impact on the company 

from time to time we are subject to litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings relating to our business or investigations or other actions by governmental agencies including as described in part i item 3 legal proceedings of this report no assurances can be given that the results of these or new matters will be favorable to us an adverse resolution of lawsuits arbitrations investigations or other proceedings or actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results including as a result of nonmonetary remedies and could also result in adverse publicity defending ourselves in these matters may be timeconsuming expensive and disruptive to normal business operations and may result in significant expense and a diversion of managements time and attention from the operation of our business which could impede our ability to achieve our business objectives additionally any amount that we may be required to pay to satisfy a judgment settlement fine or penalty may not be covered by insurance if we fail to comply with the terms contained in any settlement order or agreement with a governmental authority relating to these matters we could be subject to criminal or civil penalties which could have a material adverse impact on the company under our charter and certain indemnification agreements that we have entered into and may in the future enter into with our officers directors and certain third parties we 

could be required to indemnify and advance expenses to them in connection with their involvement in certain actions suits investigations and other proceedings there can be no assurance that any of these payments will not be material 

increases in insurance costs or inadequate insurance coverage may materially and adversely impact our business operating results and financial condition 

the company could be exposed to significant liability or loss if its property or operations were to be affected by a natural catastrophe or other event including aircraft accidents the company maintains insurance policies including but not limited to terrorism aviation hull and liability workers compensation and property and business interruption insurance but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business if the company is unable to obtain sufficient insurance with acceptable terms the costs of such insurance increase materially or if the coverage obtained is unable to pay or is insufficient relative to actual liability or losses that the company experiences whether due to insurance market conditions policy limitations and exclusions or otherwise our operations operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected

impact of covid19 and outlook 

the novel coronavirus covid19 pandemic together with the measures implemented or recommended by governmental authorities and private organizations in response to the pandemic has had an adverse impact that has been material to the companys business operating results financial condition and liquidity the company began experiencing a significant decline in international and domestic demand related to covid19 during the first quarter of 2020 the decline in demand caused a material deterioration in our revenues in 2020 resulting in a net loss of 71 billion the full extent of the ongoing impact of covid19 on the companys longerterm operational and financial performance will depend on future developments including those outside our control related to the efficacy and speed of vaccination programs in curbing the spread of the virus the introduction and spread of new variants of the virus which may be resistant to currently approved vaccines passenger testing requirements mask mandates or other restrictions on travel all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with certainty 

in response to decreased demand the company cut relative to 2019 capacity approximately 57 of its scheduled capacity for 2020 in the first quarter of 2021 the company expects scheduled capacity to be down at least 51 versus the first quarter of 2019 the company plans to continue to proactively evaluate and cancel flights on a rolling 60day basis until it sees signs of a recovery in demand and expects demand to remain suppressed relative to 2019 levels until vaccines for covid19 are widely distributed and are effective in curbing the spread of the virus in addition the company does not currently expect the recovery from covid19 to follow a linear path as such the companys actual flown capacity may differ materially from its currently scheduled capacity 

the company has taken a number of actions in response to the decreased demand for air travel in addition to the schedule reductions discussed above the company has

in addition and as announced in july 2020 the company started the involuntary furlough process by issuing worker adjustment and retraining notification warn act notices to 36000 of its employees since then the company worked to reduce the total number of furloughs to approximately 13000 employees by working closely with its union partners introducing new voluntary options selected by approximately 9000 employees and proposing creative solutions that would save jobs as a result of the companys entry into the psp2 agreement as described below the company issued recall notices to these furloughed employees and others impacted by furlough mitigation programs see the discussion below for more detail about the psp2 agreement and the recall process 

the company continues to focus on reducing expenses and managing its liquidity we expect to continue to modify our cost management structure and capacity as the timing of demand recovery becomes more certain

on january 15 2021 united entered into a payroll support agreement the psp2 agreement with treasury providing the company with total funding of approximately 26 billion pursuant to the payroll support program established under subtitle a of title iv of division n of the consolidated appropriations act 2021 the psp extension law these funds were used to pay for the wages salaries and benefits of united employees including the payment of lost wages salaries and benefits to returning employees approximately 19 billion was provided as a direct grant and approximately 753 million consists of indebtedness evidenced by a 10year senior unsecured promissory note issued by ual to treasury the psp2 note as of february 25 2021 we have received a total of 13 billion see note 2 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information on warrants issued in connection with the psp2 note and note 10 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for a discussion of the psp2 note 

pursuant to the psp2 agreement the company is required to comply with certain provisions of the psp extension law including among others the requirement that all funds provided under the payroll support program will be used by united exclusively for the continuation of payment of its us employee wages salaries and benefits including the payment of lost wages salaries and benefits to returning us employees requirements to maintain us employment levels from the date of the psp2 agreement through march 31 2021 requirements to recall as such term is defined in the psp2 agreement any us employees subject to involuntary termination or furlough between october 1 2020 and the date of the psp2 agreement

as a result of the psp2 agreement the company offered employment through march 2021 to employees who were impacted by involuntary furloughs because the company cannot predict with certainty whether it will receive further payroll support from the federal government or when demand for air travel will increase in the short term the company is preparing for the possibility that these recalled employees might again be furloughed as soon as the end of the first quarter of 2021 the company may record additional costs associated with these actions in the first quarter of 2021 also in order to reduce the number of such furloughs during the first quarter of 2021 the company offered voluntary leave and other programs to certain of its frontline employees the cost of which cannot be estimated at this time

critical accounting policies

revenue recognition  passenger revenue is recognized when transportation is provided passenger tickets and related ancillary services sold by the company for flights are purchased primarily via credit card transactions with payments collected by the company in advance of the performance of related services the company initially records ticket sales in its advance ticket sales liability deferring revenue recognition until the travel occurs for travel that has more than one flight segment the company deems each segment as a separate performance obligation and recognizes revenue for each segment as travel occurs tickets sold by other airlines where the company provides the transportation are recognized as passenger revenue at the estimated value to be billed to the other airline when travel is provided differences between amounts billed and the actual amounts may be rejected and rebilled or written off if the amount recorded was different from the original estimate when necessary the company records a reserve against its billings and payables with other airlines based on historical experience 

the company sells certain tickets with connecting flights with one or more segments operated by its other airline partners for segments operated by its other airline partners the company has determined that it is acting as an agent on behalf of the other airlines as they are responsible for their portion of the contract ie transportation of the passenger the company as the agent recognizes revenue within other operating revenue at the time of the travel for the net amount representing commission to be retained by the company for any segments flown by other airlines 

advance ticket sales represent the companys liability to provide air transportation in the future all tickets sold at any given point of time have travel dates extending up to 12 months the company defers amounts related to future travel in its advance ticket sales liability account the companys advance ticket sales liability also includes credits issued to customers on etcs and ffcs primarily for ticket cancellations which can be applied towards a purchase of a new ticket in april 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic the company extended the expiration dates of etcs from 12 months from the date of issuance to 24 months from the date of issuance and extended the expiration of ffcs for tickets issued between may 1 2019 and march 31 2020 to 24 months from the original issue date on february 24 2021 the company extended the expiration dates for all tickets issued between may 1 2019 and march 31 2021 to march 31 2022 as of december 31 2020 the companys advance ticket sales liability included 31 billion related to these credits 

the company records breakage revenue on the travel date for its estimate of tickets that will expire unused to determine breakage the company uses its historical experience with refundable and nonrefundable expired tickets and other facts such as recent aging trends program changes and modifications that could affect the ultimate expiration patterns of tickets the company continues to use its historical experience and most recent trends and program changes to estimate its breakage the company will update its breakage estimates as future information is received given the uncertainty of travel demand caused by covid19 a significant portion of the 31 billion related to the etcs and ffcs may expire unused in future periods and get recognized as breakage also the company is unable to estimate the amount of the etcs and ffcs that will be used within the next 12 months and has classified the entire amount of the advanced ticket liability in current liabilities even though some of the etcs and ffcs could be used after the next 12 months 

frequent flyer accounting uniteds mileageplus loyalty program builds customer loyalty by offering awards benefits and services to program participants members in this program earn miles for travel on united united express star alliance members and certain other airlines that participate in the program members can also earn miles by purchasing goods and services from our network of nonairline partners we have contracts to sell miles to these partners with the terms extending from one to nine years these partners include domestic and international credit card issuers retail merchants hotels car rental companies and our participating airline partners miles can be redeemed for free other than taxes and governmentimposed fees discounted or upgraded air travel and nontravel awards 

cobrand agreement  during 2020 the company entered into a third amended and restated cobranded card marketing services agreement as amended from time to time the cobrand agreement with its cobranded credit card partner chase the cobrand agreement extended the term of the agreement into 2029 and modified certain other terms resulting in a different allocation among the separately identifiable performance obligations chase awards miles to mileageplus members based on their credit card activity united identified the following significant separately identifiable performance obligations in the cobrand agreement 

• mileageplus miles awarded – united has a performance obligation to provide mileageplus cardholders with miles to be used for air travel and nontravel award redemptions the company records passenger revenue related to the travel awards when the transportation is provided and records other revenue related to the nontravel awards when the goods or services are delivered the company records the cost associated with nontravel awards in other operating revenue as an agent 

• marketing – united has a performance obligation to provide chase access to uniteds customer list and the use of uniteds brand marketing revenue is recorded to other operating revenue as miles are delivered to chase 

• advertising – united has a performance obligation to provide advertising in support of the mileageplus card in various customer contact points such as uniteds website email promotions direct mail campaigns airport advertising and inflight advertising advertising revenue is recorded to other operating revenue as miles are delivered to chase 

• other travelrelated benefits – uniteds performance obligations are comprised of various items such as waived bag fees seat upgrades and lounge passes lounge passes are recorded to other operating revenue as customers use the lounge passes bag fees and seat upgrades are recorded to passenger revenue at the time of the associated travel 

we account for all the payments received including monthly and onetime payments under the cobrand agreement by allocating them to the separately identifiable performance obligations the fair value of the separately identifiable performance obligations is determined using managements estimated selling price of each component the objective of using the estimated selling price based methodology is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis accordingly we determine our best estimate of selling price by considering multiple inputs and methods including but not limited to discounted cash flows brand value volume discounts published selling prices number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed the company estimated the selling prices and volumes over the term of the cobrand agreement in order to determine the allocation of proceeds to each of the components to be delivered we also evaluate volumes on an annual basis which may result in a change in the allocation of the estimated consideration from the cobrand agreement on a prospective basis 

indefinitelived intangible assets the company has indefinitelived intangible assets including goodwill goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis as of october 1 or on an interim basis whenever a triggering event occurs an impairment occurs when the fair value of an intangible asset is less than its carrying value the company determines the fair value using a variation of the income approach known as the excess earnings method which discounts an assets projected future net cash flows to determine the current fair value assumptions used in the discounted cash flow methodology include a discount rate which is based upon the companys current weighted average cost of capital plus an assetspecific risk factor and a projection of sales expenses gross margin tax rates and contributory asset charges for several future years and a terminal growth rate the assumptions used for future projections are determined based upon the companys assetspecific forecasts along with the companys strategic plan these assumptions are inherently uncertain as they relate to future events and circumstances actual results will be influenced by the competitive environment fuel costs and other expenses and potentially other unforeseen events or circumstances that could have a material impact on future results in light of the ongoing impact of the covid19 pandemic on both the us and global economies the significant sustained impact on the demand for travel and government policies that restrict air travel the exact timing of the recovery from the covid19 pandemic and the speed at which such recovery could occur continues to remain uncertain and could result in additional impairment charges in the future we expect to continue to modify our cost management structure and capacity as the timing of demand recovery becomes more certain 

as a result of the impairment assessments the company recorded impairment charges of 130 million during 2020 for its china routes which was primarily caused by the covid19 pandemic the companys subsequent suspension of flights to china and a further delay in the expected return of full capacity to the china markets based on our assessment at yearend a 10 decline in the fair value of our china routes would not have resulted in an incremental impairment

tax valuation allowance  a tax valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized the companys management assesses available positive and negative evidence regarding the companys ability to realize its deferred tax assets and records a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized in order to form a conclusion management considers positive evidence in the form of taxable income in prior carryback years reversing temporary differences tax planning strategies and projections of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible as well as negative evidence such as historical losses although the company was in a cumulative loss position at the end of 2020 management determined that the 2020 results were not indicative of future results due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic on its operations the company concluded that the positive evidence outweighs the negative evidence primarily driven by the approval and distribution of covid19 vaccines as well as increased confidence with the timing of the recovery the company has 66 

billion of deferred tax assets of which 23 billion are attributable to federal net operating losses nols at december 31 2020 the majority of the nols do not expire and the company expects to recognize the nols through the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities of 65 billion and projected future taxable income therefore we have not recorded a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets other than the capital loss carryforwards and state attributes that have short expiration periods while the company expects to generate sufficient future profits to fully utilize these nols the company may have to record a valuation allowance against its nols if it is unable to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods recording a valuation allowance against our nols would not impact our ability to use them however our ability to use nols may be significantly limited due to various circumstances as discussed in more detail in part i item 1a risk factors—the companys ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes to offset future taxable income for us federal income tax purposes may be significantly limited due to various circumstances including certain possible future transactions involving the sale or issuance of ual common stock or if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels assumptions about our future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage our business 

management will continue to evaluate future financial performance to determine whether such performance is both sustained and significant enough to provide sufficient evidence to support not recording a valuation allowance on these nols any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require additional valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets which could be material 

as of december 31 2020 the company has recorded 185 million of valuation allowance against its capital loss deferred tax assets capital losses have a limited carryforward period of five years and they can be utilized only to the extent of capital gains the company does not anticipate generating sufficient capital gains to utilize the losses before they expire therefore a valuation allowance is necessary as of december 31 2020 additionally the company recorded a valuation allowance of 62 million on the state nol and state tax credit deferred tax assets primarily due to utilization limitations resulting from a prior ownership change

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rates our net income is affected by fluctuations in interest rates eg interest expense on variable rate debt and interest income earned on shortterm investments the companys policy is to manage interest rate risk through a combination of fixed and variable rate debt the following table summarizes information related to the companys interest rate market risk at december 31 in millions 



as most recently announced on november 30 2020 libor is expected to be phased out starting on january 1 2022 for the oneweek and twomonth usd libor settings and starting on july 1 2023 for the remaining usd libor settings uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes or other reforms to libor may adversely impact our interest rates and related interest expense as of december 31 2020 the company had 95 billion in variable rate indebtedness see part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—other liquidity matters of this report for more information on interest expense 

a change in market interest rates would also impact interest income earned on our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments assuming our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments remain at their average 2020 levels a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a corresponding increase in the companys interest income of approximately 95 million during 2021 

commodity price risk aircraft fuel the price of aircraft fuel can significantly affect the companys operations results of operations financial position and liquidity 

our operational and financial results can be significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel to provide adequate supplies of fuel the company routinely enters into purchase contracts that are customarily indexed to market prices for aircraft fuel and the company generally has some ability to cover shortterm fuel supply and infrastructure disruptions at some major demand locations the companys current strategy is to not enter into transactions to hedge fuel price volatility although the company regularly reviews its policy based on market conditions and other factors the companys 2021 forecasted fuel consumption is presently approximately 21 billion gallons and based on this forecast a onedollar change in the price of a barrel of crude oil would change the companys annual fuel expense by approximately 49 million 

foreign currency the company generates revenues and incurs expenses in numerous foreign currencies changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the companys results of operations through changes in the dollar value of foreign currencydenominated operating revenues and expenses some of the companys more significant foreign currency exposures include the canadian dollar chinese renminbi european euro british pound and japanese yen the companys current strategy is to not enter into transactions to hedge its foreign currency sales although the company regularly reviews its policy based on market conditions and other factors 

the result of a uniform 1 strengthening in the value of the us dollar from december 31 2020 levels relative to each of the currencies in which the company has foreign currency exposure would result in a decrease in pretax income of approximately 10 million for the year ending december 31 2021 this sensitivity analysis was prepared based upon projected 2021 foreign currencydenominated revenues and expenses as of december 31 2020

2021 executive compensation program 

on february 25 2021 the compensation committee the committee of the board of directors of united airlines holdings inc the company approved the companys 2021 executive compensation program 2021 program the 2021 program is designed to be aligned with the companys recovery efforts from the covid19 pandemic and the related impacts on the global economy and the travel industry in particular as described further below the recovery design of the 2021 program includes shortterm and longterm incentive awards the 2021 program maintains salary and compensation levels linked to shortterm performance goals but significantly reduces the intended levels of longterm equity incentives granted to our executives in order to comply with the compensation limits of the cares act as described below as a result of this reduction in longterm equity incentives the compensation component levels under the 2021 program differ as compared to our traditional and intended compensation levels 

as previously disclosed in april 2020 the company entered into a payroll support program agreement the first psp agreement with the united states department of the treasury the us treasury department under the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the cares act in september 2020 the company entered into a loan agreement with the us treasury department the term loan facility pursuant to the loan program established under the cares act and in january 2021 the company and the us treasury department entered into the payroll support program extension agreement together with the first psp agreement the psp agreement as a condition of the psp agreement and the term loan facility the company is subject to restrictions on the amount of total compensation that it can provide to certain employees including each of the companys named executive officers these compensation restrictions continue until the later of i october 1 2022 and ii one year after full repayment of all loans under the term loan facility which has a maturity date of september 26 2025 such period is referred to herein as the cares act restricted period 

the annual total target compensation levels for our executives are set with reference to market practices of a peer group of companies and the benchmarking results are balanced with additional factors such as each executives experience knowledge skills roles and contributions to the company the committee also considers internal pay parity among our executives as a result of the cares act limitations on executive compensation the company is prohibited from providing our executives the full value of the intended compensation levels during the cares act restricted period the 2021 program is designed to motivate and retain our executives while complying with the compensation limits under the cares act 

the compensation packages of our executives also were significantly reduced during 2020 as previously disclosed scott kirby our ceo and brett hart our president each waived 100 of his 2020 base salary for portions of 2020 in recognition of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the companys business and to lead by example in addition no payments were made under our 2020 annual incentive program aip the total salary amounts waived during 2020 were as follows including reference to the percent of total annual salary that was waived for 2020 mr kirby—784470 82 mr hart—545737 70 and mr gerald laderman our executive vice president and chief financial officer—151057 21 the target level of the 2020 aip awards for which no payments were made were as follows mr kirby—2500000 mr hart—1356250 and mr laderman—758500 

shortterm incentives on february 25 2021 the committee authorized shortterm performancebased restricted stock unit rsu awards recovery performance rsus under the companys 2017 incentive compensation plan the 2017 plan in lieu of the cashbased payment structure of the 2020 aip under the recovery performance rsus the committee established shortterm performance goals based on financial and customer satisfaction metrics that are deemed critical to the companys success as it emerges from the worst crisis in the history of the aviation industry the equity design of the recovery performance rsus places emphasis on company stock price performance and is designed to further support alignment of interests between our executives and stockholders 

the recovery performance rsus may be granted to officers and employees of united airlines inc united or any subsidiary of united generally a recipient of a recovery performance rsu award must remain continuously employed from the date of grant through the last day of the performance period in order to be eligible for vesting of the award however if the recipients employment is terminated by reason of death or disability then the award will vest on a prorated basis based on the number of days worked during the performance period and assuming achievement of the target level 

longterm equity incentives the committee sets the intended longterm equity compensation levels as an element of the annual total target compensation package based on the peer benchmarking results and other factors referenced above however in designing the 2021 program the committee determined that it was appropriate to implement the required cares act compensation limits through reductions to the target grant level of the longterm equity awards the 2021 reductions to the longterm equity awards to comply with the cares act limits are detailed in the table below 



the entire 2021 lti equity award for mr hart and a portion of the 2021 lti equity award 1574000 for mr kirby will not be granted until a later date in accordance with the requirements of the cares act which counts and restricts total compensation on a rolling 12month basis 

as noted above in order to support continued alignment with the companys stockholders the shortterm incentive component is being delivered entirely in equity in addition while the shortterm component of the 2021 program emphasizes performance goals deemed critical to the companys emergence from the covid19 pandemic the 2021 longterm incentive retains the timevested equity component included in the companys longterm incentive design in prior years the timevested equity component enhances stability of the longterm incentive by reducing volatility as compared to performancebased awards which is expected to enhance retention value while assuring that a significant portion of compensation is directly linked to the companys stock price performance 

vesting of the timevested rsus is subject to the employees continued employment with the company or its subsidiaries from the date of grant through each vesting date except as otherwise provided by the committee or as provided in the 2017 plan the timevested awards under the 2021 program generally vest in sixmonth increments over a twoyear period on august 31 st and february 28th the committee established this vesting schedule in consideration of the significant reduction in the longterm equity incentives under the 2021 program as compared to the intended levels under the companys traditional total compensation design in addition this vesting schedule is balanced by the extended vesting period of the longterm contingent cash awards described below which include a vesting condition that may extend for more than five years 

consistent with our prior longterm incentive design if the employee remains continuously employed by the company or an affiliate from the date of grant until the date upon which a qualifying event which is generally a termination of employment within two years following a change of control of the company under circumstances entitling the employee to a cash severance payment occurs then on the date of such qualifying event the employees rights with respect to all rsus that are not then vested will become vested and all restrictions on such rsus will lapse further if the employees employment is terminated by reason of death or disability then all rsus that are not then vested will fully vest 

longterm contingent cash awards on february 25 2021 the committee also approved longterm contingent cash awards the longterm cash awards in recognition of the companys need to reward and retain its management team as it continues to navigate the companys responses to the covid19 pandemic the committee approved longterm cash awards to messrs kirby hart and laderman with a contingent payment opportunity equal to three times the executives base salary level at the time of grant under the terms of the longterm cash awards payment of the award is contingent upon the recipients continued employment with the company through the later of i three years from the date of award or ii the expiration of the cares act restricted period if the recipients employment is terminated by reason of death or disability then the longterm cash award is payable in full to the recipient or his or her estate 

in making the determination to grant the longterm cash awards the committee considered concerns related to the need to retain and reward our management team throughout the current crisis considerations related to compensation benchmarking and internal and external pay parity and managements voluntary waivers of significant salary amounts in 2020 the longterm cash awards are intended to enhance our ability to retain our management team during this time of unprecedented challenges for the company and the airline industry as a whole particularly as our management team has marketable skills that are highly valued and transferable to other companies including companies in industries that have not been as adversely impacted by covid19

aircraft fuel the table below summarizes uals aircraft fuel consumption and expense during the last three years 

our operational and financial results can be significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel to provide adequate supplies of fuel the company routinely enters into purchase contracts that are customarily indexed to market prices for aircraft fuel and the company generally has some ability to cover shortterm fuel supply and infrastructure disruptions at certain major demand locations the price of aircraft fuel has fluctuated substantially in the past several years the companys current strategy is to not enter into transactions to hedge its fuel consumption although the company regularly reviews its strategy based on market conditions and other factors 

thirdparty business united generates thirdparty business revenue that includes maintenance services catering frequent flyer award nontravel redemptions and ground handling thirdparty business revenue is recorded in other operating revenue expenses associated with thirdparty business except nontravel redemptions are recorded in other operating expenses nontravel redemptions expenses are recorded to other operating revenue 

distribution channels the companys airline seat inventory and fares are distributed through the companys direct channels traditional travel agencies and online travel agencies the use of the companys direct sales website wwwunitedcom the companys mobile applications and alternative distribution systems provides the company with an opportunity to decommoditize its services better present its content make more targeted offerings better retain its customers enhance its brand and lower its ticket distribution costs agency sales are primarily sold using global distribution systems gds united has developed and expects to continue to develop capabilities to sell certain ancillary products through the gds channel to provide an enhanced buying experience for customers who purchase in that channel 

industry conditions 

domestic competition the domestic airline industry is highly competitive and dynamic the companys competitors consist primarily of other airlines and to a certain extent other forms of transportation currently any us carrier deemed fit by the us department of transportation the dot is largely free to operate scheduled passenger service between any two points within the united states competition can be direct in the form of another carrier flying the exact nonstop route or indirect where a carrier serves the same two cities nonstop from an alternative airport in that city or via an itinerary requiring a connection at another airport air carriers cost structures are not uniform and are influenced by numerous factors carriers with lower costs may offer lower fares to passengers which could have a potential negative impact on the companys revenues domestic pricing decisions are impacted by intense competitive pressure exerted on the company by other us airlines in order to remain competitive and maintain passenger traffic levels we often find it necessary to match competitors discounted fares since we compete in a dynamic marketplace attempts to generate additional revenue through increased fares often fail 

international competition internationally the company competes not only with us airlines but also with foreign carriers international competition has increased and may continue to increase in the future as a result of airline mergers and acquisitions jbas alliances restructurings liberalization of aviation bilateral agreements and new or increased service by competitors including government subsidized competitors from certain middle east countries competition on international routes is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation the companys ability to compete successfully with nonus carriers on international routes depends in part on its ability to generate traffic to and from the entire united states via its integrated domestic route network and its ability to overcome business and operational challenges across its network worldwide foreign carriers currently are prohibited by us law from carrying local passengers between two points in the united states and the company generally experiences comparable restrictions in foreign countries separately fifth freedom rights allow the company to operate between points in two different foreign countries and foreign carriers may also have fifth freedom rights between the us and another foreign country in the absence of fifth freedom rights or some other extrabilateral right to conduct operations between two foreign countries us carriers are constrained from carrying passengers to points beyond designated international gateway cities to compensate partially for these structural limitations us and foreign carriers have entered into alliances immunized jbas and marketing arrangements that enable these carriers to exchange traffic between each others flights and route networks see alliances above for additional information 

seasonality the air travel business is subject to seasonal fluctuations historically demand for air travel is higher in the second and third quarters driving higher revenues than in the first and fourth quarters which are periods of lower travel demand 

industry regulation 

domestic regulation all carriers engaged in air transportation in the united states are subject to regulation by the dot absent an exemption no air carrier may provide air transportation of passengers or property without first being issued a dot certificate of public convenience and necessity the dot also grants international route authority approves international codeshare arrangements and regulates methods of competition the dot regulates consumer protection and maintains jurisdiction over advertising denied boarding compensation tarmac delays baggage liability and other areas and may add additional expensive regulatory burdens in the future the dot has launched investigations or claimed rulemaking authority to regulate commercial agreements among carriers or between carriers and third parties in a wide variety of contexts 

airlines are also regulated by the federal aviation administration the faa an agency within the dot primarily in the areas of flight safety air carrier operations and aircraft maintenance and airworthiness the faa issues air carrier operating certificates and aircraft airworthiness certificates prescribes maintenance procedures oversees airport operations and regulates pilot and other employee training from time to time the faa issues directives that require air carriers to inspect modify or ground aircraft and other equipment potentially causing the company to incur substantial unplanned expenses the airline industry is also subject to numerous other federal laws and regulations the us department of homeland security dhs has jurisdiction over virtually every aspect of civil aviation security the antitrust division of the us department of justice doj has jurisdiction over certain airline competition matters the us postal service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail by airlines labor relations in the airline industry are generally governed by the railway labor act rla a federal statute the company is also subject to investigation inquiries by the dot faa doj dhs the us food and drug administration fda the us department of agriculture usda and other us and international regulatory bodies 

airport access access to landing and takeoff rights or slots at several major us airports served by the company are subject to government regulation federallymandated domestic slot restrictions that limit operations and regulate capacity currently apply at three airports reagan national airport in washington dc reagan national john f kennedy international airport and laguardia airport laguardia in the new york city metropolitan region of these three airports united currently operates at two reagan national and laguardia additional restrictions on takeoff and landing slots at these and other airports may be implemented in the future and could affect the companys rights of ownership and transfer as well as its operations 

legislation  the airline industry is subject to legislative actions or inactions that may have an impact on operations and costs in 2018 the us congress approved a fiveyear reauthorization for the faa which encompasses significant aviation tax and policyrelated issues the law includes a range of policy changes related to airline customer service and aviation safety which are ongoing and depending on how they are implemented could impact our operations and costs additionally the us congress may consider legislation related to aviation safety as well as environmental issues which could impact the company and the airline industry 

catering operations  the company owns and operates catering kitchens at airports in denver cleveland newark houston and honolulu which prepare readytoeat food for united flights some of the companys kitchens also prepare readytoeat food for other domestic and international airlines the companys onboard food service operations are subject to fda regulation through its interstate conveyance sanitation regulations and the companys catering operations are subject to regulation by the fda and the usda as well as other federal state and local regulatory agencies in particular the fda enforces the federal food safety modernization act which requires all food manufacturers including readytoeat catering operations to implement stringent riskbased preventive controls as a result the companys catering and food service operations are periodically subject to inspections and enforcement by regulatory agencies 

international regulation international air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation in connection with the companys international services the company is regulated by both the us government and the governments of the foreign countries the company serves in addition the availability of international routes to us carriers is regulated by aviation agreements between the us and foreign governments and in some cases fares and schedules require the approval of the dot andor the relevant foreign governments 

legislation foreign countries are increasingly enacting passenger protection laws rules and regulations that meet or exceed us requirements in cases where this activity exceeds us requirements additional burden and liability may be placed on the company certain countries have regulations requiring passenger compensation andor enforcement penalties from the company in addition to changes in operating procedures due to canceled and delayed flights 

airport access historically access to foreign markets has been tightly controlled through bilateral agreements between the us and each foreign country involved these agreements regulate the markets served the number of carriers allowed to serve each market and the frequency of carriers flights since the early 1990s the us has pursued a policy of open skies meaning all usflag carriers have access to the destination under which the us government has negotiated a number of bilateral agreements allowing unrestricted access between us and foreign markets currently there are more than 100 open skies agreements in effect however even with open skies many of the airports that the company serves in europe asia and latin america maintain slot controls a large number of these slot controls exist due to congestion environmental and noise protection and reduced capacity due to runway and air traffic control atc construction work among other reasons london heathrow international airport frankfurt rheinmain airport shanghai pudong international airport beijing capital international airport sao paulo guarulhos international airport and tokyo haneda international airport are among the most restrictive foreign airports due to slot and capacity limitations 

the companys ability to serve some foreign markets and expand into certain others is limited by the absence of aviation agreements between the us government and the relevant foreign governments shifts in us or foreign government aviation policies may lead to the alteration or termination of air service agreements depending on the nature of any such change the value of the companys international route authorities and slot rights may be materially enhanced or diminished similarly foreign governments control their airspace and can restrict our ability to overfly their territory enhancing or diminishing the value of the companys existing international route authorities and slot rights 

environmental regulation the airline industry is subject to increasingly stringent federal state local and international environmental requirements including those regulating emissions to air water discharges safe drinking water and the use and management of hazardous substances and wastes 

climate change  there is an increasing global regulatory focus on greenhouse gas ghg emissions and their potential impacts relating to climate change an initiative to regulate ghg emissions from aviation known as the european union eu emission trading system ets was adopted in 2009 but applicability to flights arriving or departing from airports outside the eu has been postponed several times in december 2017 the european parliament voted to extend exemptions for extraeu flights until december 2023 in order to align the extension date with the completion of the pilot phase of the international civil aviation organizations icao carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation corsia corsia which was adopted in october 2016 is intended to create a single global marketbased measure to achieve carbonneutral growth for international aviation after 2020 which can be achieved through airline purchases of carbon offset credits however the european parliament is expected to assess corsia implementation and reassess the applicability of eu ets to international aviation in 2024 at which point the eu could require all extra and intraeu flights to participate in eu ets certain corsia program details remain to be developed and could potentially be affected by political developments in participating countries or the results of the pilot phase of the program and thus the impact of corsia cannot be fully predicted however corsia is expected to increase operating costs for the company depending on a number of factors including the number of its flights that are subject to corsia the fuel efficiency of the companys fleet the companys purchase and use of corsiaeligible sustainable aviation fuels aviation sector growth and the price of corsiaeligible offsets in 2017 icao also adopted a carbon dioxide co2 emission standard for aircraft in 2016 the us environmental protection agency epa commenced procedural steps necessary to adopt its own standard but has not yet taken further action while the precise timing and final form of these various programs and requirements continue to evolve the company is taking various actions that are expected to help reduce its co2 emissions over time such as improving fuel efficiency fleet renewal aircraft retrofits and promoting the commercialization of sustainable aviation fuels 

other regulations  our operations are subject to a variety of other environmental laws and regulations both in the united states and internationally these include noiserelated restrictions on aircraft types and operating times and state and local air quality initiatives which have or could in the future result in curtailments in services increased operating costs limits on expansion or further emission reduction requirements certain airports andor governments both domestically and internationally either have or are seeking to establish environmental fees and other requirements applicable to carbon emissions local air quality pollutants andor noise the implementation of these requirements is expected to result in restrictions on mobile sources such as cars trucks and airport ground support equipment in corresponding locations finally environmental cleanup laws could require the company to undertake or subject the company to liability for investigation and remediation costs at certain owned or leased locations or thirdparty disposal locations 

until applicability of new regulations to our specific operations is better defined andor until pending regulations are finalized future costs to comply with such regulations will remain uncertain but are likely to increase our operating costs over time while we continue to monitor these developments the precise nature of future requirements and their applicability to the company are difficult to predict but the financial impact to the company and the aviation industry could be significant

risk factors 

tableend the following risk factors should be read carefully when evaluating the companys business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this report and other statements the company or its representatives make from time to time any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect the companys business operating results financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this report 

if we do not successfully execute our strategic operating plan or if our strategic operating plan is unsuccessful our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

we have announced several strategic plans in recent years including several revenuegenerating initiatives and plans to optimize our revenue such as our plans to add capacity including international expansion and new or increased service to midsize airports and initiatives and plans to optimize and control our costs we also continue to explore opportunities to enhance our segmentation including the introduction of polaris basic economy and united premium plus and are implementing many programs and policies to improve the customer experience at all points in air travel in developing our strategic operating plan we make certain assumptions including but not limited to those related to customer demand competition market consolidation the availability of aircraft and the global economy actual economic market and other conditions may be different from our assumptions in 2019 our capacity growth was lower than planned due to the grounding of boeing 737 max aircraft among other factors which adversely impacted our ability to execute our strategic operating plans if we do not successfully execute our strategic operating plan or if actual results vary significantly from our assumptions our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted 

unfavorable economic and political conditions in the united states and globally may have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

the companys business and operating results are significantly impacted by us and global economic and political conditions the airline industry is highly cyclical and the level of demand for air travel is correlated to the strength of the us and global economies robust demand for the companys air transportation services depends largely on favorable economic conditions including the strength of the domestic and foreign economies low unemployment levels strong consumer confidence levels and the availability of consumer and business credit air transportation is often a discretionary purchase that leisure travelers may limit or eliminate during difficult economic times shorthaul travelers in particular have the option to replace air travel with surface travel in addition during periods of unfavorable economic conditions business travelers historically have reduced the volume of their travel either due to costsaving initiatives the replacement of travel with alternatives such as videoconferencing or as a result of decreased business activity requiring travel during such periods the companys business and operating results may be adversely affected due to significant declines in industry passenger demand particularly with respect to the companys business and premium cabin travelers and a reduction in fare levels 

as a global business with operations outside of the united states from which it derives significant operating revenues volatile conditions in certain international regions may have a negative impact on the companys operating results and its ability to achieve its business objectives the companys international operations are a vital part of its worldwide airline network political disruptions and instability in certain regions can negatively impact the demand and network availability for air travel additionally any deterioration in global trade relations such as increased tariffs or other trade barriers could result in a decrease in the demand for international air travel 

stagnant or weakening global economic conditions either in the united states or in other geographic regions may have a material adverse effect on the companys revenues operating results and liquidity 

the global airline industry is highly competitive and susceptible to price discounting and changes in capacity which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

the airline industry is highly competitive marked by significant competition with respect to routes fares schedules both timing and frequency services products customer service and frequent flyer programs consolidation in the airline industry the rise of wellfunded government sponsored international carriers changes in international alliances and the creation of immunized jbas have altered and are expected to continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with increased financial resources more extensive global networks and services and competitive cost structures 

airlines also compete by increasing or decreasing their capacity including route systems and the number of destinations served several of the companys domestic and international competitors have increased their international capacity by including service to some destinations that the company currently serves causing overlap in destinations served and therefore increasing competition for those destinations this increased competition in both domestic and international markets may have 

a material adverse effect on the companys business operating results and financial condition 

the companys us operations are subject to competition from traditional network carriers national pointtopoint carriers and discount carriers including lowcost carriers and ultralowcost carriers such carriers may have lower costs and provide service at lower fares to destinations also served by the company the significant presence of lowcost carriers and ultralowcost carriers which engage in substantial price discounting may diminish our ability to achieve sustained profitability on domestic and international routes our ability to compete in the domestic market effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure if we cannot maintain our costs at a competitive level then our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

our international operations are subject to competition from both foreign and domestic carriers competition is significant from government subsidized competitors from certain middle east countries these carriers have large numbers of international widebody aircraft on order and are increasing service to the us from their hubs in the middle east the government support provided to these carriers has allowed them to grow quickly reinvest in their product invest in other airlines and expand their global presence we also face competition from foreign carriers operating under fifth freedom rights permitted under international treaties that allow certain carriers to provide service to and from stopover points between their home country and ultimate destination including points in the united states in competition with service provided by us 

through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers us carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation such as services to and beyond traditional global gateway cities similarly foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior us passenger traffic beyond traditional us gateway cities through these relationships in addition several jbas among us and foreign carriers have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules pricing sales and inventory if we are not able to continue participating in these types of alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements in the future our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

high andor volatile fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a material adverse impact on the companys strategic plans operating results financial condition and liquidity 

aircraft fuel is critical to the companys operations and is one of our largest operating expenses during the year ended december 31 2019 the companys fuel expense was approximately 90 billion  the timely and adequate supply of fuel to meet operational demand depends on the continued availability of reliable fuel supply sources as well as related service and delivery infrastructure although the company has some ability to cover shortterm fuel supply and infrastructure disruptions at some major demand locations it depends significantly on the continued performance of its vendors and service providers to maintain supply integrity consequently the company can neither predict nor guarantee the continued timely availability of aircraft fuel throughout the companys system 

aircraft fuel has historically been the companys most volatile operating expense due to the highly unpredictable nature of market prices for fuel the company generally sources fuel at prevailing market prices market prices for aircraft fuel have historically fluctuated substantially in short periods of time and continue to be highly volatile due to a dependence on a multitude of unpredictable factors beyond the companys control these factors include changes in global crude oil prices the balance between aircraft fuel supply and demand natural disasters prevailing inventory levels and fuel production and transportation infrastructure prices of fuel are also impacted by indirect factors such as geopolitical events economic growth indicators fiscalmonetary policies fuel tax policies changes in regulations environmental concerns and financial investments in energy markets both actual changes in these factors as well as changes in related market expectations can potentially drive rapid changes in fuel prices in short periods of time 

given the highly competitive nature of the airline industry the company may not be able to increase its fares and fees sufficiently to offset the full impact of increases in fuel prices especially if these increases are significant rapid and sustained further any such fare or fee increase may not be sustainable may reduce the general demand for air travel and may also eventually impact the companys strategic growth and investment plans for the future in addition decreases in fuel prices for an extended period of time may result in increased industry capacity increased competitive actions for market share and lower fares or surcharges if fuel prices were to then subsequently rise quickly there may be a lag between the rise in fuel prices and any improvement of the revenue environment 

to protect against increases in the market prices of fuel the company may hedge a portion of its future fuel requirements the company does not currently hedge its future fuel requirements however to the extent the company decides to start a hedging program such hedging program may not be successful in mitigating higher fuel costs and any price protection provided may be limited due to the choice of hedging instruments and market conditions including breakdown of correlation between hedging instrument and market price of aircraft fuel and failure of hedge counterparties to the extent that the company decides to hedge a portion of its future fuel requirements and uses hedge contracts that have the potential to create an obligation 

to pay upon settlement if fuel prices decline significantly such hedge contracts may limit the companys ability to benefit fully from lower fuel prices in the future if fuel prices decline significantly from the levels existing at the time the company enters into a hedge contract the company may be required to post collateral margin beyond certain thresholds there can be no assurance that the companys hedging arrangements if any will provide any particular level of protection against rises in fuel prices or that its counterparties will be able to perform under the companys hedging arrangements additionally deterioration in the companys financial condition could negatively affect its ability to enter into new hedge contracts in the future 

the company relies heavily on technology and automated systems to operate its business and any significant failure or disruption of the technology or these systems could materially harm its business 

the company depends on automated systems and technology to operate its business including but not limited to computerized airline reservation systems demand prediction software flight operations systems revenue management systems accounting systems technical and business operations systems telecommunication systems and commercial websites and applications including wwwunitedcom and the united airlines app uniteds website and other automated systems must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic maintain secure information and deliver important flight and schedule information as well as process critical financial transactions these systems could suffer substantial or repeated disruptions due to various events some of which are beyond the companys control including natural disasters power failures terrorist attacks equipment or software failures or cyber security attacks we have initiatives in place to prevent disruptions and disaster recovery plans and we continue to invest in improvements to these initiatives and plans however these measures may not be adequate to prevent or mitigate disruptions substantial or repeated systems failures or disruptions including failures or disruptions related to the companys complex integration of systems could reduce the attractiveness of the companys services versus those of its competitors materially impair its ability to market its services and operate its flights result in the unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information result in increased costs lost revenue and the loss or compromise of important data and may adversely affect the companys business operating results and financial condition 

the companys business relies extensively on thirdparty service providers including certain technology providers failure of these parties to perform as expected or interruptions in the companys relationships with these providers or their provision of services to the company could have a material adverse effect on the companys business operating results and financial condition 

the company has engaged thirdparty service providers to perform a large number of functions that are integral to its business including regional operations operation of customer service call centers distribution and sale of airline seat inventory provision of information technology infrastructure and services transmitting or uploading of data provision of aircraft maintenance and repairs provision of various utilities performance of aircraft fueling operations and catering services among other vital functions and services the company does not directly control these thirdparty service providers although generally it does enter into agreements that define expected service performance and compliance requirements such as compliance with legal requirements including anticorruption laws however there can be no assurance that our thirdparty service providers will adhere to these requirements 

any of these thirdparty service providers however may materially fail to meet its service performance commitments to the company or may suffer disruptions to its systems that could impact its services for example failures in certain thirdparty technology or communications systems may cause flight delays or cancellations the failure of any of the companys thirdparty service providers to perform its service obligations adequately or other interruptions of services may reduce the companys revenues and increase its expenses prevent the company from operating its flights and providing other services to its customers or result in adverse publicity or harm to our brand we may also be subject to consequences from any illegal conduct of our thirdparty service providers including for their failure to comply with anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act in addition the companys business and financial performance could be materially harmed if its customers believe that its services are unreliable or unsatisfactory 

the company may also have disagreements with such providers or such contracts may be terminated or may not be extended or renewed for example the number of flight reservations booked through thirdparty gdss or online travel agents otas may be adversely affected by disruptions in the business relationships between the company and these suppliers such disruptions including a failure to agree upon acceptable contract terms when contracts expire or otherwise become subject to renegotiation may cause the companys flight information to be limited or unavailable for display by the affected gds or ota operator significantly increase fees for both the company and gdsota users and impair the companys relationships with its customers and travel agencies any such disruptions or contract terminations may adversely impact our operations and financial results 

if we are not able to negotiate or renew agreements with thirdparty service providers or if we renew existing agreements on less favorable terms our operations and financial results may be adversely affected 

the company could experience adverse publicity harm to its brand reduced travel demand and potential tort liability as a result of an accident catastrophe or incident involving its aircraft or its operations the aircraft or operations of its regional carriers the aircraft or operations of its codeshare partners or the aircraft or operations of another airline which may result in a material adverse effect on the companys business operating results and financial condition 

an accident catastrophe or incident involving an aircraft that the company operates or an aircraft that is operated by a codeshare partner one of the companys regional carriers or another airline or an incident involving the companys operations or the operations of a codeshare partner one of the companys regional carriers or of another airline could have a material adverse effect on the company if such accident catastrophe or incident created a public perception that the companys operations or the operations of its codeshare partners or regional carriers are not safe or reliable or are less safe or reliable than other airlines additionally any accident catastrophe or incident involving an aircraft type that is operated by the company its codeshare partners or regional carriers could have a material adverse effect on the company if such accident catastrophe or incident creates a public perception that such aircraft type was not safe or reliable such public perception could in turn result in adverse publicity for the company cause harm to the companys brand and reduce travel demand on the companys flights or the flights of its codeshare partners or regional carriers 

in addition any such accident catastrophe or incident involving the company its regional carriers or its codeshare partners could expose the company to significant tort liability although the company currently maintains liability insurance in amounts and of the type the company believes to be consistent with industry practice to cover damages arising from any such accident catastrophe or incident and the companys codeshare partners and regional carriers carry similar insurance and generally indemnify the company for their operations if the companys liability exceeds the applicable policy limits or the ability of another carrier to indemnify it the company could incur substantial losses from an accident catastrophe or incident which may result in a material adverse effect on the companys operating results and financial condition 

terrorist attacks international hostilities or other security events or the fear of terrorist attacks or hostilities even if not made directly on the airline industry could negatively affect the company and the airline industry 

terrorist attacks or international hostilities even if not made on or targeted directly at the airline industry or the fear of or the precautions taken in anticipation of such attacks including elevated national threat warnings travel restrictions selective cancellation or redirection of flights and new security regulations could materially and adversely affect the company and the airline industry security events pose a significant risk to our passenger and cargo operations these events could include acts of violence in public areas that we cannot control the companys financial resources may not be sufficient to absorb the adverse effects of any future terrorist attacks international hostilities or other security events any such events could have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition liquidity and operating results 

increasing privacy and data security obligations or a significant data breach may adversely affect the companys business 

in our regular business operations we collect transmit process and store sensitive data including personal information of our customers and employees such as payment processing information and information of our business partners the company depends on the ability to use information we collect to provide our services and operate our business 

the company must manage increasing legislative regulatory and consumer focus on privacy issues and data security for example in may 2018 the eus general data protection regulation became effective which imposes significant privacy and data security requirements as well as potential for substantial penalties for noncompliance recent penalties imposed by regulators have resulted in substantial adverse financial consequences to those companies also some of the companys commercial partners such as credit card companies have imposed data security standards that the company must meet these standards continue to evolve the company will continue its efforts to meet its privacy and data security obligations however it is possible that certain new obligations or customer expectations may be difficult to meet and could increase the companys costs 

additionally the company must manage evolving cybersecurity risks our network systems and storage applications and those systems and storage and other business applications maintained by our thirdparty providers may be subject to attempts to gain unauthorized access breach malfeasance or other system disruptions in some cases it is difficult to anticipate or to detect immediately such incidents and the damage caused thereby in addition as attacks by cybercriminals become more sophisticated frequent and intense the costs of proactive defense measures may increase while we continually work to safeguard our internal network systems including through risk assessments system monitoring information security policies and employee awareness and training and review and validate our thirdparty security standards there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyberattacks or data breaches 

the loss disclosure misappropriation of or access to customers employees or business partners information or the companys failure to meet its obligations could result in legal claims or proceedings penalties and remediation costs a 

significant data breach or the companys failure to meet its obligations may adversely affect the companys reputation relationships with our business partners business operating results and financial condition 

the mandatory grounding of our boeing 737 max 9 aircraft may have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

on march 13 2019 the federal aviation administration issued an emergency order prohibiting the operation of boeing 737 max series aircraft by us certificated operators the faa order as a result the company grounded all 14 boeing 737 max 9 aircraft in its fleet and boeing also suspended deliveries of new boeing 737 max series aircraft the company does not know whether on what conditions or when the max grounding will end the longterm operational and financial impact of this grounding is uncertain and could negatively affect the company based on a number of factors including among others the period of time the aircraft are unavailable the availability of replacement aircraft to the extent needed and the circumstances of any reintroduction of the grounded aircraft to service 

in 2019 the grounding affected the delivery of 16 boeing 737 max aircraft that were scheduled for delivery and were not delivered and it is also expected to affect the timing of future boeing 737 max aircraft deliveries including the 28 boeing 737 max aircraft that the company planned to take delivery in 2020 the extent of the delay of future deliveries is expected to be impacted by the length of time the faa order remains in place boeings production rate and the pace at which boeing can deliver aircraft following the lifting of the faa order among other factors 

the company continues to make adjustments to its flight schedule and operations including substituting replacement aircraft on routes originally intended to be flown by boeing 737 max aircraft the grounding has impacted the companys ability to implement its strategic growth strategy reducing the companys scheduled capacity from its planned capacity and has resulted in increased costs as well as lower operating revenue the company has had discussions with boeing regarding compensation from boeing for the companys financial damages related to the grounding of the airlines boeing 737 max aircraft however the parties have not agreed to any settlement and the amount nature and timing of any settlement with boeing remains uncertain 

disruptions to our regional network and united express flights provided by thirdparty regional carriers could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

the company has contractual relationships with various regional carriers to provide regional aircraft service branded as united express these regional operations are an extension of the companys mainline network and complement the companys operations by carrying traffic that connects to mainline service and allows flights to smaller cities that cannot be provided economically with mainline aircraft the companys business and operations are dependent on its regional flight network with regional capacity accounting for approximately 11 of the companys total capacity for the year ended december 31 2019  

although the company has agreements with its regional carriers that include contractually agreed performance metrics each regional carrier is a separately certificated commercial air carrier and the company does not control the operations of these carriers a number of factors may impact the companys regional network including weatherrelated effects and seasonality in addition the decrease in qualified pilots driven by changes to federal regulations has adversely impacted and could continue to affect the companys regional flying for example the faas expansion of minimum pilot qualification standards including a requirement that a pilot have at least 1500 total flight hours as well as the faas revised pilot flight and duty time requirements under part 117 of the federal aviation regulations have contributed to a smaller supply of pilots available to regional carriers the decrease in qualified pilots resulting from the regulations as well as factors including a decreased student pilot population and a shrinking us military from which to hire qualified pilots could adversely impact the companys operations and financial condition and could also require the company to reduce regional carrier flying 

if a significant disruption occurs to the companys regional network or flights or if one or more of the regional carriers with which the company has relationships is unable to perform their obligations over an extended period of time there could be a material adverse effect on the companys business operating results and financial condition 

current or future litigation and regulatory actions or failure to comply with the terms of any settlement order or arrangement relating to these actions could have a material adverse impact on the company 

from time to time we are subject to litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings relating to our business or investigations or other actions by governmental agencies including as described in part i item 3 legal proceedings of this report no assurances can be given that the results of these or new matters will be favorable to us an adverse resolution of lawsuits arbitrations investigations or other proceedings or actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results including as a result of nonmonetary remedies and could also result in adverse publicity defending ourselves in these matters may be timeconsuming expensive and disruptive to normal business operations and may 

result in significant expense and a diversion of managements time and attention from the operation of our business which could impede our ability to achieve our business objectives additionally any amount that we may be required to pay to satisfy a judgment settlement fine or penalty may not be covered by insurance if we fail to comply with the terms contained in any settlement order or agreement with a governmental authority relating to these matters we could be subject to criminal or civil penalties which could have a material adverse impact on the company under our charter and certain indemnification agreements that we have entered into and may in the future enter into with our officers directors and certain third parties we could be required to indemnify and advance expenses to them in connection with their involvement in certain actions suits investigations and other proceedings there can be no assurance that any of these payments will not be material 

our significant investments in other airlines including in other parts of the world and the commercial relationships that we have with those carriers may not produce the returns or results we expect 

an important part of our strategy to expand our global network includes making significant investments in airlines both domestically and in other parts of the world and expanding our commercial relationships with these carriers for example in january 2019 we completed the acquisition of a 499 interest in manaair llc which as of immediately following the closing of that investment owns 100 of the equity interests in expressjet airlines llc a domestic regional airline we also have minority equity interests in commutair and republic airways holdings inc see note 9 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information regarding our investments in regional airlines we also have significant investments in latin american airlines including significant investments in avianca holdings sa avh and brw aviation llc brw an affiliate of synergy aerospace corporation and the majority shareholder of avh and an equity investment in azul see note 8 and note 9 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information regarding our investments in avh and azul respectively see also the additional risks with respect to our investment in avh described in this part i item 1a risk factors 

we expect to continue exploring similar noncontrolling investments in and entering into jbas commercial agreements loan transactions and strategic alliances with other carriers as part of our regional and global business strategy these transactions and relationships involve significant challenges and risks and we face competition in forming and maintaining these relationships since there are a limited number of potential arrangements and other airlines are looking to enter into similar relationships we are dependent on these other carriers for significant aspects of our network in the regions in which they operate while we work closely with these carriers each is a separately certificated commercial air carrier and we do not have control over their operations strategy management or business methods and not only are these airlines subject to a number of the same risks as our business which are described elsewhere in this part i item 1a risk factors including competitive pressures on pricing demand and capacity changes in aircraft fuel pricing and the impact of global and local political and economic conditions on operations and customer travel patterns among others they are also subject to their own distinct financial and operational risks 

as a result of these and other factors we may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment and we may not receive repayment of any invested or loaned funds further these investments may not generate the revenue or operational synergies we expect and they may distract management focus from our operations or other strategic options finally our reliance on these other carriers in the regions in which they operate may negatively impact our regional and global operations and results if those carriers are impacted by general business risks or perform below our expectations or needs any one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition 

we may also be subject to consequences from any illegal conduct of jba partners including for failure to comply with anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act furthermore our relationships with these carriers may be subject to the laws and regulations of nonus jurisdictions in which these carriers are located or conduct business in addition any political or regulatory change in these jurisdictions that negatively impacts or prohibits our arrangements with these carriers could have an adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition to the extent that the operations of any of these carriers are disrupted over an extended period of time or their actions subject us to the consequences of failure to comply with laws and regulations our operating results may be adversely affected 

our significant investments in avh and its affiliates and the commercial relationships that we have with avianca may not produce the returns or results we expect 

in november 2018 as part of our global network strategy united entered into a revenuesharing jba with avianca a subsidiary of avh copa and several of their respective affiliates subject to regulatory approval concurrently with this transaction united as lender entered into a term loan agreement the brw term loan agreement with among others brw aviation holding llc brw holding and brw as guarantor and borrower respectively pursuant to the brw term loan agreement united provided to brw a 456 million term loan the brw term loan secured by a pledge of brws equity as well as brws 516 million common shares of avh which are eligible to be converted into the same number of 

preferred shares which maybe be deposited with the depositary for avhs american depositary receipts adrs the class of avh securities that trades on the new york stock exchange the nyse in exchange for 645 million adrs such shares and equity collectively the brw loan collateral brw is currently in default under the brw term loan agreement in order to protect the value of its collateral on may 24 2019 united began to exercise certain remedies available to it under the terms of the brw term loan agreement and related documents in connection with the delivery by united of a notice of default to brw kingsland holdings limited kingsland avhs largest minority shareholder was granted in accordance with the agreements related to the brw term loan agreement authority to manage brw which remains the majority shareholder of avh after a hearing on september 26 2019 a new york state court granted kingsland summary judgment authorizing it to foreclose on the brw loan collateral under the brw term loan agreement kingsland is continuing with the foreclosure process which is expected to result in a judicially supervised sale of the brw loan collateral the new york state court also granted kingslands motion for a preliminary injunction that among other things enjoins brw holding from interfering with kingslands ability to exercise voting and other rights in certain equity interests in brw these rulings are intermediate steps in the judicial foreclosure process in new york and are subject to appeal the repayment of the brw term loan is dependent on this judicial foreclosure process and there is no assurance that a judicial foreclosure sale will be completed or if completed will result in the full satisfaction of all of the obligations under the brw term loan our ability to enforce a deficiency judgment against brw in the event that the proceeds from the sale of the brw loan collateral in the judicial foreclosure are insufficient to repay the full amount of the brw term loan may be limited any of these circumstances may lead to a loss or delay in the repayment of the brw term loan further the amount we receive from the foreclosure sale of the brw loan collateral may be inadequate to fully pay the amounts owed to us by brw and our costs incurred to foreclose repossess and sell the property 

in november 2019 united entered into a senior secured convertible term loan agreement the avh convertible loan agreement with among others avh as borrower for the provision by the lenders thereunder including united to avh of convertible term loans for general corporate purposes in december 2019 united provided such a convertible term loan to avh under the convertible loan agreement in the aggregate amount of 150 million the avh convertible loan 

see note 8 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information regarding our investments in avh and its affiliates 

these transactions and relationships involve significant challenges and risks particularly given avhs recent debt restructuring and the judicial foreclosure process to which the repayment of the brw term loan is subject while avh has successfully carried out its debt restructuring plan to date there is no guarantee that such debt restructuring plan will improve avhs longterm financial condition uniteds exposure to which has increased with the completion of the avh convertible loan while we work closely with avianca in connection with the jba and have supported avh by providing capital in the form of the avh convertible loan avianca is a separately certificated commercial air carrier and we do not have control over its or avhs operations strategy management or business methods avianca is also subject to a number of the same risks as our business which are described in this part i item 1a risk factors including competitive pressures on pricing demand and capacity changes in aircraft fuel pricing and the impact of global and local political and economic conditions on operations and customer travel patterns among others as well as to its own distinct financial and operational risks 

in addition the value of the brw loan collateral and the collateral securing the avh convertible loan is subject to market and other conditions changes in the aviation market may adversely affect the value of the brw loan collateral and the collateral securing the avh convertible loan and thereby lower the value to be derived from a foreclosure or other exercise of remedies with respect to the brw term loan agreement or the avh convertible loan as a result of these and other factors including delays in foreclosure proceedings we may not receive full repayment of our brw term loan or our avh convertible loan and we may be unable to realize the full value of the brw loan collateral or the collateral securing the avh convertible loan as a consequence we may not realize a satisfactory return on our invested or loaned funds with respect to avh and its affiliates 

further these investments may not generate the revenue or operational synergies we expect and they may distract management focus from our operations or other strategic options finally our reliance on avianca in the region in which it operates may negatively impact our global operations and results if avh does not successfully recover from its debt restructuring or is otherwise impacted by general business risks or performs below our expectations or needs any one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition 

the airline industry may undergo further change with respect to alliances and jbas or due to consolidations any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company 

the company faces and may continue to face strong competition from other carriers due to the modification of alliances and formation of new jbas carriers may improve their competitive positions through airline alliances slot swaps andor jbas certain types of airline jbas further competition by allowing multiple airlines to coordinate routes pool revenues and costs 

and enjoy other mutual benefits achieving many of the benefits of consolidation open skies agreements including the longstanding agreements between the united states and each of the eu canada japan korea new zealand australia colombia and panama as well as the more recent agreements between the united states and each of mexico and brazil may also give rise to better integration opportunities among international carriers movement of airlines between current global airline alliances could reduce joint network coverage for members of such alliances while also creating opportunities for jbas and bilateral alliances that did not exist before such realignment further airline and airline alliance consolidations or reorganizations could occur in the future the company routinely engages in analyses and discussions regarding its own strategic position including current and potential alliances asset acquisitions and divestitures and may have future discussions with other airlines regarding strategic activities if other airlines participate in such activities those airlines may significantly improve their cost structures or revenue generation capabilities thereby potentially making them stronger competitors of the company and potentially impairing the companys ability to realize expected benefits from its own strategic relationships 

orders for new aircraft typically must be placed years in advance of scheduled deliveries and changes in the companys network strategy over time or other factors outside of the companys control may make aircraft on order less economic for the company result in costs related to modification or termination of aircraft orders or cause the company to enter into orders for new aircraft on less favorable terms 

the companys orders for new aircraft are typically made years in advance of actual delivery of such aircraft and the financial commitment required for purchases of new aircraft is substantial at december 31 2019  the company had firm commitments to purchase 304 new aircraft from the boeing company boeing airbus sas airbus and embraer sa embraer as well as related agreements with engine manufacturers maintenance providers and others as of december 31 2019  the companys commitments relating to the acquisition of aircraft and related spare engines aircraft improvements and other related obligations aggregated to a total of 267 billion  

subsequent to the company placing an order for new aircraft the companys network strategy may change as a result the companys preference for a particular aircraft that it has ordered often years in advance may be decreased or eliminated if the company were to modify or terminate any of its existing aircraft order commitments it may be responsible for material liabilities to its counterparties arising from any such modification additionally the company may have a need for additional aircraft that are not available under its existing orders in such cases the company may seek to acquire aircraft from other sources such as through lease arrangements which may result in higher costs or less favorable terms or through the purchase or lease of used aircraft the company may not be able to acquire such aircraft when needed on favorable terms or at all 

the imposition of new tariffs or any increase in existing tariffs on the importation of commercial aircraft that the company orders may result in higher costs for example in october 2019 the united states imposed tariffs on certain imports from the eu including a customs duty at an ad valorem rate of 10 on new commercial aircraft which rate in february 2020 was increased to 15 these tariffs apply to certain new airbus aircraft that we have on order while the scope and rate of these tariffs are subject to change if and to the extent these tariffs are imposed on us they could increase the effective cost of among other things new airbus aircraft 

a majority of the companys aircraft and certain parts are sourced from single suppliers therefore the company would be materially and adversely affected if it were unable to obtain timely deliveries additional equipment or support from any of these suppliers 

the company currently sources the majority of its aircraft and many related aircraft parts from boeing in addition our aircraft suppliers are dependent on other suppliers for certain other aircraft parts therefore if the company is unable to acquire additional aircraft from boeing or if boeing fails to make timely deliveries of aircraft or to provide adequate support for its products the companys operations could be materially and adversely affected the company is also dependent on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft engines and certain other aircraft parts and could therefore also be materially and adversely affected in the event of the unavailability of these engines and other parts 

union disputes employee strikes or slowdowns and other laborrelated disruptions could adversely affect the companys operations and could result in increased costs that impair its financial performance 

united is a highly unionized company as of december 31 2019  the company and its subsidiaries had approximately 96000 active employees of whom approximately 84 were represented by various us labor organizations see part i item 1 business—employees of this report for additional information on our represented employee groups and collective bargaining agreements 

there is a risk that unions or individual employees might pursue judicial or arbitral claims arising out of changes implemented as a result of the company entering into collective bargaining agreements with its represented employee groups there is also a possibility that employees or unions could engage in job actions such as slowdowns worktorule campaigns sickouts or other 

actions designed to disrupt the companys normal operations in an attempt to pressure the company in collective bargaining negotiations although the rla makes such actions unlawful until the parties have been lawfully released to selfhelp and the company can seek injunctive relief against premature selfhelp such actions can cause significant harm even if ultimately enjoined similarly if the operations of our thirdparty regional carriers ground handlers or other vendors are impacted by laborrelated disruptions our operations could be adversely affected in addition collective bargaining agreements with the companys represented employee groups increase the companys labor costs which increase could be material 

an outbreak of disease or similar public health threat such as the coronavirus could have a material adverse impact on the companys business operating results and financial condition 

an outbreak of disease or similar public health threat or fear of such an event that affects travel demand travel behavior or travel restrictions could have a material adverse impact on the companys business financial condition and operating results in addition outbreaks of disease could result in increased government restrictions and regulation including quarantines of our personnel or an inability to access facilities or our aircraft which could adversely affect our operations 

in december 2019 a novel strain of coronavirus covid19 was reported in wuhan china the world health organization has declared covid19 to constitute a public health emergency of international concern on january 30 2020 the us department of state issued a level 4 do not travel advisory for china the us government has also implemented enhanced screenings quarantine requirements and travel restrictions in connection with the covid19 outbreak the company has suspended its flights between the united states and each of beijing chengdu shanghai and hong kong through april 24 2020 these routes represented approximately 5 of the companys 2020 planned capacity and the companys other transpacific routes represented an additional 10 of the companys 2020 planned capacity as of the date of this report the company is experiencing an approximately 100 decline in nearterm demand to china and an approximately 75 decline in nearterm demand on the rest of the companys transpacific routes the extent of the impact of the covid19 on the companys operational and financial performance will depend on future developments including the duration and spread of the outbreak and related travel advisories and restrictions and the impact of the covid19 on overall demand for air travel all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted if traffic on the companys transpacific routes were to remain at these levels for an extended period andor routes in other parts of the companys network begin to see significant declines in demand our results of operations for full year 2020 may be materially adversely affected 

if we experience changes in or are unable to retain our senior management team or other key employees our operating results could be adversely affected 

much of our future success depends on the continued availability of skilled personnel with industry experience and knowledge including our senior management team and other key employees if we are unable to attract and retain talented highly qualified senior management and other key employees or if we are unable to effectively provide for the succession of senior management our business may be adversely affected 

extended interruptions or disruptions in service at major airports where we operate could have a material adverse impact on our operations 

the airline industry is heavily dependent on business models that concentrate operations in major airports in the united states and throughout the world an extended interruption or disruption at an airport where we have significant operations could have a material impact on our business financial condition and results of operation 

we operate principally through our domestic hubs in at newark chicago ohare denver houston bush lax guam sfo and washington dulles substantially all of our flights either originate in or fly into one of these locations a significant interruption or disruption in service at one of our hubs or other airports where we have a significant presence resulting from atc delays weather conditions natural disasters growth constraints relations with thirdparty service providers failure of computer systems disruptions to government agencies or personnel including as a result of government shutdowns disruptions at airport facilities or other key facilities used by us to manage our operations labor relations power supplies fuel supplies terrorist activities international hostilities or otherwise could result in the cancellation or delay of a significant portion of our flights and as a result could have a material impact on our business operating results and financial condition we have minimal control over the operation quality or maintenance of these services or whether vendors will improve or continue to provide services that are essential to our business 

the airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation which imposes significant costs and may adversely impact our business operating results and financial condition 

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal oversight compliance with us and international regulations imposes significant costs and may have adverse effects on the company laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges both 

domestically and internationally have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce airline revenue the airline industry is heavily taxed and additional taxation could negatively impact our business 

united provides air transportation under certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by the dot if the dot altered amended modified suspended or revoked these certificates it could have a material adverse effect on the companys business the dot also regulates consumer protection and through its investigations or rulemaking authority could impose restrictions that materially impact the companys business the faa regulates the safety of uniteds operations united operates pursuant to an air carrier operating certificate issued by the faa the faas regulations include stringent pilot flight and duty time requirements under part 117 of the federal aviation regulations as well as minimum qualifications for air carrier first officers these regulations have caused mainline airlines to hire regional pilots while simultaneously significantly reducing the pool of new pilots from which regional carriers themselves can hire although this is an industry issue it directly affects the company and has required it to reduce regional partner flying as several regional partners have experienced difficulty flying their schedules due to reduced pilot availability from time to time the faa also issues orders airworthiness directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require material expenditures or operational restrictions by the company these faa orders and directives have resulted in the temporary grounding of an entire aircraft type if the faa identifies design manufacturing maintenance or other issues requiring immediate corrective action including the faa order grounding boeing 737 max aircraft these faa directives or requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company 

in 2018 the us congress approved a fiveyear reauthorization for the faa which encompasses significant aviation tax and policyrelated issues the law includes a range of policy changes related to airline customer service and aviation safety which are ongoing and depending on how they are implemented could impact our operations and costs additionally the us congress may consider legislation related to aviation safety as well as environmental issues which could impact the company and the airline industry 

the companys operations may also be adversely impacted due to the existing antiquated atc system utilized by the us government and regulated by the faa during peak travel periods in certain markets the current atc systems inability to handle demand has led to shortterm capacity constraints imposed by government agencies and resulted in delays and disruptions of air traffic in addition the current system will not be able to effectively handle projected future air traffic growth the outdated technologies also cause the atc to be less resilient in the event of a failure causing flight cancellations and delays imposition of these atc constraints on a longterm basis may have a material adverse effect on the companys operations failure to update the atc system in a timely manner and the substantial funding requirements of a modernized atc system that may be imposed on air carriers may have an adverse impact on the companys financial condition or operating results 

access to landing and takeoff rights or slots at several major us airports and many foreign airports served by the company are or recently have been subject to government regulation certain of the companys major hubs are among the most congested airports in the united states and have been or could be the subject of regulatory action that might limit the number of flights andor increase costs of operations at certain times or throughout the day the faa may limit the companys airport access by limiting the number of departure and arrival slots at high density traffic airports which could affect the companys ownership and transfer rights and local airport authorities may have the ability to control access to certain facilities or the cost of access to their facilities which could have an adverse effect on the companys business the faa historically has taken actions with respect to airlines slot holdings that airlines have challenged if the faa were to take actions that adversely affect the companys slot holdings the company could incur substantial costs to preserve its slots or may lose slots if slots are eliminated at an airport or if the number of hours of operation governed by slots is reduced at an airport the lack of controls on takeoffs and landings could result in greater congestion both at the affected airport or in the regional airspace eg the new york city metropolitan region airspace and could significantly impact the companys operations further the companys operating costs at airports including the companys major hubs may increase significantly because of capital improvements at such airports that the company may be required to fund directly or indirectly such costs could be imposed by the relevant airport authority without the companys approval and may have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition 

the ability of carriers to operate flights on international routes between the united states and other countries is highly regulated applicable arrangements between the united states and foreign governments may be amended from time to time government policies with respect to airport operations may be revised and the availability of appropriate slots or facilities may change the company currently operates a number of flights on international routes under government arrangements regulations or policies that designate the number of carriers permitted to operate on such routes the capacity of the carriers providing services on such routes the airports at which carriers may operate international flights or the number of carriers allowed access to particular airports any limitations additions or modifications to such arrangements regulations or policies could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition and operating results additionally a change in law 

regulation or policy for any of the companys international routes such as open skies could have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition and operating results and could result in the impairment of material amounts of related tangible and intangible assets in addition competition from revenuesharing jbas and other alliance arrangements by and among other airlines could impair the value of the companys business and assets on the open skies routes the companys plans to enter into or expand us antitrust immunized alliances and jbas on various international routes are subject to receipt of approvals from applicable us federal authorities and obtaining other applicable foreign government clearances or satisfying the necessary applicable regulatory requirements there can be no assurance that such approvals and clearances will be granted or will continue in effect upon further regulatory review or that changes in regulatory requirements or standards can be satisfied 

see part i item 1 business—industry regulation of this report for additional information on government regulation impacting the company 

we are subject to many forms of environmental regulation and liability and risks associated with climate change and may incur substantial costs as a result 

many aspects of the companys operations are subject to increasingly stringent federal state local and international laws protecting the environment including those relating to emissions to the air water discharges safe drinking water and the use and management of hazardous materials and wastes compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures and violations can lead to significant fines and penalties in addition from time to time we are identified as a responsible party for environmental investigation and remediation costs under applicable environmental laws due to the disposal of hazardous substances generated by our operations we could also be subject to environmental liability claims from various parties including airport authorities related to our operations at our owned or leased premises or the offsite disposal of waste generated at our facilities 

we may incur substantial costs as a result of changes in weather patterns due to climate change increases in the frequency severity or duration of severe weather events such as thunderstorms hurricanes flooding typhoons tornados and other severe weather events could result in increases in delays and cancellations turbulencerelated injuries and fuel consumption to avoid such weather any of which could result in significant loss of revenue and higher costs 

to mitigate climate change risks corsia has been developed by icao a un specialized agency corsia is intended to create a single global marketbased measure to achieve carbonneutral growth for international aviation after 2020 through airline purchases of carbon offset credits certain corsia program details remain to be developed and could potentially be affected by political developments in participating countries or the results of the pilot phase of the program and thus the impact of corsia cannot be fully predicted however corsia is expected to result in increased operating costs for airlines that operate internationally including the company 

in addition to corsia the epa has begun preliminary work to adopt its own aircraft engine ghg emission standards which were expected to be aligned with recent icao carbon dioxide emission standards the timing of any us epa aircraft engine ghg emission standards is currently unknown but some jurisdictions in which united operates have adopted or are considering ghg emission reduction initiatives which could impact various aspects of the companys business the precise nature of future requirements and their applicability to the company are difficult to predict but the financial impact to the company and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant 

see part i item 1 business—industry regulation—environmental regulation of this report for additional information on environmental regulation impacting the company 

the united kingdoms withdrawal from the eu may adversely impact our operations in the united kingdom and elsewhere 

in june 2016 united kingdom uk voters approved an advisory referendum for the uk to exit the eu the uk parliament voted in favor of allowing the government to commence negotiations to determine the future terms of the uks relationship with the eu including the terms of trade between the uk and the eu and other nations on january 31 2020 the uk withdrew from the eu and started a transition period that will potentially run through december 31 2020 the nature and terms of the uks relationship with the eu after the transition period remain uncertain 

in connection with a uk exit from the eu we could face new challenges in our operations such as instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets this instability could result in market volatility including in the value of the british pound and european euro additional travel restrictions on passengers traveling between the uk and other eu countries changes to the legal status of euresident employees legal uncertainty and divergent national laws and regulations at this time we cannot predict the impact that the uks exit from the eu will have on our business generally and our uk and 

european operations more specifically and no assurance can be given that our operating results financial condition and prospects would not be adversely impacted by the result 

the companys operating results fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors associated with the airline industry many of which are beyond the companys control 

due to greater demand for air travel during the spring and summer months revenues in the airline industry in the second and third quarters of the year are generally stronger than revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year which are periods of lower travel demand the companys operating results generally reflect this seasonality but have also been impacted by numerous other factors that are not necessarily seasonal including among others extreme or severe weather outbreaks of disease or pandemics atc congestion geological events political instability terrorism natural disasters changes in the competitive environment due to industry consolidation tax obligations general economic conditions and other factors as a result the companys quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year and historical operating results in a quarterly or annual period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 

increases in insurance costs or inadequate insurance coverage may materially and adversely impact our business operating results and financial condition 

the company could be exposed to significant liability or loss if its property or operations were to be affected by a natural catastrophe or other event including aircraft accidents the company maintains insurance policies including but not limited to terrorism aviation hull and liability workers compensation and property and business interruption insurance but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business if the company is unable to obtain sufficient insurance with acceptable terms the costs of such insurance increase materially or if the coverage obtained is insufficient relative to actual liability or losses that the company experiences whether due to insurance market conditions policy limitations and exclusions or otherwise our operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

the company has a significant amount of financial leverage from fixed obligations and insufficient liquidity may have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition and business 

the company has a significant amount of financial leverage from fixed obligations including aircraft lease and debt financings leases of airport property and other facilities and other material cash obligations in addition the company has substantial noncancelable commitments for capital expenditures including for the acquisition of new aircraft and related spare engines 

although the companys cash flows from operations and its available capital including the proceeds from financing transactions have been sufficient to meet these obligations and commitments to date the companys future liquidity could be negatively affected by the risk factors discussed in this report if the companys liquidity is materially diminished the company might not be able to timely pay its leases and debts or comply with certain operating and financial covenants under its financing and credit card processing agreements or with other material provisions of its contractual obligations 

the companys substantial level of indebtedness and noninvestment grade credit rating as well as market conditions and the availability of assets as collateral for loans or other indebtedness may make it difficult for the company to raise additional capital if needed to meet its liquidity needs on acceptable terms or at all 

in addition as of december 31 2019  the company had 34 billion in variable rate indebtedness all or a portion of which uses london interbank offered rates libor as a benchmark for establishing applicable rates as announced in july 2017 libor is expected to be phased out by the end of 2021 although many of our liborbased obligations provide for alternative methods of calculating the interest rate payable if libor is not reported the extent and manner of any future changes with respect to methods of calculating libor or replacing libor with another benchmark are unknown and impossible to predict at this time and as such may result in interest rates that are materially higher than current interest rates if interest rates applicable to the companys variable interest indebtedness increase the companys interest expense will also increase which could make it difficult for the company to make interest payments and fund other fixed costs and in turn adversely impact our cash flow available for general corporate purposes 

see part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report for additional information regarding the companys liquidity 

agreements governing our debt include financial and other covenants failure to comply with these covenants could result in events of default 

our financing agreements include various financial and other covenants certain of these covenants require ual or united as applicable to maintain minimum liquidity andor minimum collateral coverage ratios uals or uniteds ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond its control including the overall industry revenue environment the level of fuel costs and the appraised value of the collateral in addition our financing agreements contain other negative covenants customary for such financings these covenants are subject to important exceptions and qualifications if we fail to comply with these covenants and are unable to remedy or obtain a waiver or amendment an event of default would result 

if an event of default were to occur the lenders could among other things declare outstanding amounts immediately due and payable in addition an event of default or declaration of acceleration under one financing agreement could also result in an event of default under other of our financing agreements due to crossdefault and crossacceleration provisions the acceleration of significant amounts of debt could require us to renegotiate repay or refinance the obligations under our financing arrangements 

the company may never realize the full value of its intangible assets or its longlived assets causing it to record impairments that may negatively affect its financial condition and operating results 

in accordance with applicable accounting standards the company is required to test its indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently where there is an indication of impairment in addition the company is required to test certain of its other assets for impairment where there is any indication that an asset may be impaired 

the company may be required to recognize losses in the future due to among other factors extreme fuel price volatility tight credit markets government regulatory changes decline in the fair values of certain tangible or intangible assets such as aircraft route authorities airport slots and frequent flyer database unfavorable trends in historical or forecasted results of operations and cash flows and an uncertain economic environment as well as other uncertainties for example in 2019 and 2018 the company recorded impairment charges of 90 million and 206 million  respectively associated with its hong kong routes resulting in the full impairment of these assets the company can provide no assurance that a material impairment loss of tangible or intangible assets will not occur in a future period the value of the companys aircraft could be impacted in future periods by changes in supply and demand for these aircraft such changes in supply and demand for certain aircraft types could result from the grounding of aircraft an impairment loss could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition and operating results 

any damage to our reputation or brand image could adversely affect our business or financial results 

we operate in a publicfacing industry and maintaining a good reputation is critical to our business the companys reputation or brand image could be adversely impacted by any failure to maintain satisfactory practices for all of our operations and activities any failure to achieve andor make progress toward our environmental and sustainability goals public pressure from investors or policy groups to change our policies customer perceptions of our advertising campaigns sponsorship arrangements or marketing programs customer perceptions of our use of social media or customer perceptions of statements made by us our employees and executives agents or other third parties damage to our reputation or brand image or loss of customer confidence in our services could adversely affect our business and financial results as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation

operating revenue the table below illustrates the yearoveryear percentage change in the companys operating revenues for the years ended december 31 in millions except percentage changes 

the table below presents selected passenger revenue and operating data of the company broken out by geographic region expressed as yearoveryear changes 

passenger revenue increased 19 billion  or 51  in 2019 as compared to 2018  primarily due to a 40 increase in traffic continuing strong domestic demand improvements in average fares in the latin and domestic markets and increases in ancillary fees driven by improved product offerings 

cargo revenue decreased 58 million  or 47  in 2019 as compared to 2018  primarily due to an approximately 3 decrease in cargo ton miles and a 2 decline in cargo ton mile yield 

in december 2019 a novel strain of coronavirus covid19 was reported in wuhan china the world health organization has declared covid19 to constitute a public health emergency of international concern on january 30 2020 the us department of state issued a level 4 do not travel advisory for china the us government has also implemented enhanced screenings quarantine requirements and travel restrictions in connection with the covid19 outbreak the company has suspended its flights between the united states and each of beijing chengdu shanghai and hong kong through april 24 2020 these routes represented approximately 5 of the companys 2020 planned capacity and the companys other transpacific routes represented an additional 10 of the companys 2020 planned capacity as of the date of this report the company is experiencing an approximately 100 decline in nearterm demand to china and an approximately 75 decline in nearterm demand on the rest of the companys transpacific routes the extent of the impact of the covid19 on the companys operational and financial performance will depend on future developments including the duration and spread of the outbreak and related travel advisories and restrictions and the impact of the covid19 on overall demand for air travel all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted if traffic on the companys transpacific routes were to remain at these levels for an extended period andor routes in other parts of the companys network begin to see significant declines in demand our results of operations for full year 2020 may be materially adversely affected

critical accounting policies 

critical accounting policies are defined as those that are affected by significant judgments and uncertainties which potentially could result in materially different accounting under different assumptions and conditions the company has prepared the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions the company has identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of the financial statements 

frequent flyer accounting uniteds mileageplus loyalty program builds customer loyalty by offering awards benefits and services to program participants members in this program earn miles for travel on united united express star alliance members and certain other airlines that participate in the program members can also earn miles by purchasing goods and services from our network of nonairline partners we have contracts to sell miles to these partners with the terms extending from one to nine years these partners include domestic and international credit card issuers retail merchants hotels car rental companies and our participating airline partners miles can be redeemed for free other than taxes and governmentimposed fees discounted or upgraded air travel and nontravel awards 

miles earned in conjunction with travel when frequent flyers earn miles for flights the company recognizes a portion of the ticket sales as revenue when the travel occurs and defers a portion of the ticket sale representing the value of the related miles as a separate performance obligation the company determines the estimated selling price of travel and miles as if each element is sold on a separate basis the total consideration from each ticket sale is then allocated to each of these elements individually on a prorata basis at the time of travel the company records the portion allocated to the miles to frequent flyer deferred revenue on the companys consolidated balance sheet and subsequently recognizes it into revenue when miles are redeemed for air travel and nonair travel awards 

cobrand agreement  united has a significant contract the cobrand agreement to sell mileageplus miles to its cobranded credit card partner jpmorgan chase bank na chase chase awards miles to mileageplus members based on their credit card activity united identified the following significant separately identifiable performance obligations in the cobrand agreement 

 we account for all the payments received including monthly and onetime payments under the cobrand agreement by allocating them to the separately identifiable performance obligations the fair value of the separately identifiable performance obligations is determined using managements estimated selling price of each component the objective of using the estimated selling price based methodology is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis accordingly we determine our best estimate of selling price by considering multiple inputs and methods including but not limited to discounted cash flows brand value volume discounts published selling prices number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed the company estimated the selling prices and volumes over the term of the cobrand agreement in order to determine the allocation of proceeds to each of the components to be delivered we also evaluate volumes on an annual basis which may result in a change in the allocation of the estimated consideration from the cobrand agreement on a prospective basis 

in february 2020  the company announced that they had entered into a third amended and restated cobranded card marketing services agreement as amended from time to time the agreement with chase the agreement which replaces the cobrand agreement also extends the term into 2029 and modifies certain other terms we will continue to account for the considerations received under the agreement to the separately identifiable performance obligations using the estimated selling price allocation methodology explained above in connection with the agreement the company entered into an amended and restated cobranded card strategic alliance agreement with visa usa inc 

estimate of miles not expected to be redeemed  the companys estimated selling price of miles is based on an equivalent ticket value less breakage which incorporates the expected redemption of miles as the best estimate of selling price for these miles the equivalent ticket value is based on the prior 12 months weighted average equivalent ticket value of similar fares as those used to settle award redemptions while taking into consideration such factors as redemption pattern cabin class loyalty status and geographic region the estimated selling price of miles is adjusted by breakage that considers a number of factors including redemption patterns of various customer groups the companys breakage model is based on the assumption that the likelihood that an account will redeem its miles can be estimated based on a consideration of the accounts historical behavior the company uses a logit regression model to estimate the probability that an account will redeem its current miles balance the company reviews its breakage estimates annually based upon the latest available information the companys estimate of the expected breakage of miles requires significant management judgment current and future changes to breakage assumptions or to program rules and program redemption opportunities may result in material changes to the deferred revenue balance as well as recognized revenues from the program for the portion of the outstanding miles that we estimate will not be redeemed we recognize the associated value proportionally as the remaining miles are redeemed 

the following table summarizes information related to the companys frequent flyer deferred revenue liability 

brw notes receivable the brw term loan currently in default is secured by a pledge of brws equity as well as brws 516 million common shares of avh in order to protect the value of its collateral on may 24 2019 united began to exercise certain remedies available to it under the terms of the brw term loan agreement and related documents in connection with the delivery by united of a notice of default to brw kingsland holdings limited kingsland avhs largest minority shareholder was granted in accordance with the agreements related to the brw term loan agreement authority to manage brw which remains the majority shareholder of avh in addition kingsland is pursuing a foreclosure process which is expected to result in a judicially supervised sale of the collateral following the grant of summary judgment by a new york state court on september 26 2019 

united evaluated the 499 million carrying value of the brw term loan as of december 31 2019 using the fair value of the collateral and determined that the value of the collateral is sufficient to recover the carrying value of the brw term loan as a result the company concluded that the brw term loan is not impaired the carrying value of the brw term loan represents the original loan amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and certain expenses associated with the loan origination 

the fair market value of avh equity was estimated using an income approach and a market approach with equal weight applied to each approach under the income approach the value was estimated by discounting expected future cash flows at a weighted average cost of capital to a single present value amount under the market approach the value was estimated by reference to multiples of enterprise value to earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and rent ebitdar for a group of publiclytraded market comparable companies along with avhs own ebitdar levels

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend interest rates our net income is affected by fluctuations in interest rates eg interest expense on variable rate debt and interest income earned on shortterm investments the companys policy is to manage interest rate risk through a combination of fixed and variable rate debt the following table summarizes information related to the companys interest rate market risk at december 31 in millions 

as announced in july 2017 libor is expected to be phased out by the end of 2021 uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes or other reforms to libor may adversely impact our interest rates and related interest expense as of december 31 2019 the company had 34 billion in variable rate indebtedness see part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—other liquidity matters of this report for more information on interest expense 

a change in market interest rates would also impact interest income earned on our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments assuming our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments remain at their average 2019 levels a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a corresponding increase in the companys interest income of approximately 47 million during 2020  

commodity price risk aircraft fuel the price of aircraft fuel can significantly affect the companys operations results of operations financial position and liquidity 

our operational and financial results can be significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel to provide adequate supplies of fuel the company routinely enters into purchase contracts that are customarily indexed to market prices for aircraft fuel and the company generally has some ability to cover shortterm fuel supply and infrastructure disruptions at some major demand locations the companys current strategy is to not enter into transactions to hedge fuel price volatility although the company regularly reviews its policy based on market conditions and other factors the companys 2020 forecasted fuel consumption is presently approximately 45 billion gallons and based on this forecast a onedollar change in the price of a barrel of crude oil would change the companys annual fuel expense by approximately 108 million 

foreign currency the company generates revenues and incurs expenses in numerous foreign currencies changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the companys results of operations through changes in the dollar value of foreign currencydenominated operating revenues and expenses some of the companys more significant foreign currency exposures include the canadian dollar chinese renminbi european euro british pound and japanese yen the companys current strategy is to not enter into transactions to hedge its foreign currency sales although the company regularly reviews its policy based on market conditions and other factors 

the result of a uniform 1 strengthening in the value of the us dollar from december 31 2019 levels relative to each of the currencies in which the company has foreign currency exposure would result in a decrease in pretax income of approximately 23 million for the year ending december 31 2020  this sensitivity analysis was prepared based upon projected 2020 foreign currencydenominated revenues and expenses as of december 31 2019

all of the companys domestic hubs are located in large business and population centers contributing to a large amount of origin and destination traffic the hub and spoke system allows us to transport passengers between a large number of destinations with substantially more frequent service than if each route were served directly the hub system also allows us to add service to a new destination from a large number of cities using only one or a limited number of aircraft as discussed under alliances  below united is a member of star alliance the worlds largest alliance network 

regional  the company has contractual relationships with various regional carriers to provide regional aircraft service branded as united express  this regional service complements our operations by carrying traffic that connects to our hubs and allows flights to smaller cities that cannot be provided economically with mainline aircraft republic airlines republic champlain enterprises llc dba commutair commutair expressjet airlines expressjet gojet airlines gojet mesa airlines mesa skywest airlines skywest air wisconsin airlines air wisconsin and trans states airlines trans states are all regional carriers that operate with capacity contracted to united under capacity purchase agreements cpas under these cpas the company pays the regional carriers contractually agreed fees carrier costs for operating these flights plus a variable reimbursement incentive payment for operational performance based on agreed performance metrics subject 

to annual adjustments the fees for carrier costs are based on specific rates for various operating expenses of the regional carriers such as crew expenses maintenance and aircraft ownership some of which are multiplied by specific operating statistics eg block hours departures while others are fixed monthly amounts under these cpas the company is responsible for all fuel costs incurred as well as landing fees and other costs which are either passed through by the regional carrier to the company without any markup or directly incurred by the company and in some cases the company owns or leases some or all of the aircraft subject to the cpa and leases or subleases as applicable such aircraft to the regional carrier  in return the regional carriers operate the capacity of the aircraft included within the scope of such cpa exclusively for united on schedules determined by the company the company also determines pricing and revenue management assumes the inventory and distribution risk for the available seats and permits mileage accrual and redemption for regional flights through its mileageplus ®  loyalty program 

alliances  united is a member of star alliance a global integrated airline network and the largest and most comprehensive airline alliance in the world as of january 1 2019  star alliance carriers served over 1300 airports in 193 countries with 18800 daily departures star alliance members in addition to united are adria airways aegean airlines air canada air china air india air new zealand all nippon airways ana asiana airlines austrian airlines aerovías del continente americano sa avianca avianca brasil brussels airlines copa airlines croatia airlines egyptair ethiopian airlines eva air lot polish airlines lufthansa sas scandinavian airlines shenzhen airlines singapore airlines south african airways swiss tap air portugal thai airways international and turkish airlines in addition to its members star alliance includes shanghaibased juneyao airlines as a connecting partner 

united has a variety of bilateral commercial alliance agreements and obligations with star alliance members addressing among other things reciprocal earning and redemption of frequent flyer miles access to airport lounges and with certain star alliance members codesharing of flight operations whereby one carriers selected flights can be marketed under the brand name of another carrier in addition to the alliance agreements with star alliance members united currently maintains independent marketing alliance agreements with other air carriers including aeromar aer lingus air dolomiti azul linhas aéreas brasileiras sa azul boutique air cape air eurowings hawaiian airlines and silver airways in addition to the marketing alliance agreements with air partners united also offers a traintoplane codeshare and frequent flyer alliance with amtrak from newark on select city pairs in the northeastern united states 

united also participates in four passenger joint business arrangements jbas one with air canada and the lufthansa group which includes lufthansa and its affiliates austrian airlines brussels airlines eurowings and swiss covering transatlantic routes one with ana covering certain transpacific routes one with air new zealand covering certain routes between the united states and new zealand and one with avianca and copa airlines which upon receipt of regulatory approvals will cover routes between the united states and central and south america excluding brazil these passenger jbas enable the participating carriers to integrate the services they provide in the respective regions capturing revenue synergies and delivering enhanced customer benefits such as highly competitive flight schedules fares and services united also participates in cargo jbas with ana for transpacific cargo services and with lufthansa for transatlantic cargo services these cargo jbas offer expanded and more seamless access to cargo space across the carriers respective combined networks 

loyalty program  uniteds mileageplus loyalty program builds customer loyalty by offering awards benefits and services to program participants members in this program earn miles for flights on united united express star alliance members and certain other airlines that participate in the program members can also earn miles by purchasing the goods and services of our network of nonairline partners such as domestic and international credit card issuers retail merchants hotels and car rental companies members can redeem miles for free other than taxes and government imposed fees discounted or upgraded travel and nontravel awards

aircraft fuel  the table below summarizes uals aircraft fuel consumption and expense during the last three years 



our operational and financial results can be significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel to provide adequate supplies of fuel the company routinely enters into purchase contracts that are customarily indexed to market prices for aircraft fuel and the company generally has some ability to cover shortterm fuel supply and infrastructure disruptions at certain major demand locations the price of aircraft fuel has fluctuated substantially in the past several years the companys current strategy is to not enter into transactions to hedge its fuel consumption although the company regularly reviews its strategy based on market conditions and other factors 

thirdparty business united generates thirdparty business revenue that includes frequent flyer award nonair redemptions maintenance services catering and ground handling thirdparty business revenue is recorded in other operating revenue expenses associated with thirdparty business except nonair redemptions are recorded in other operating expenses nonair redemptions expenses are recorded to other operating revenue 

distribution channels  the companys airline seat inventory and fares are distributed through the companys direct channels traditional travel agencies and online travel agencies the use of the companys direct sales website wwwunitedcom the companys mobile applications and alternative distribution systems provides the company with an opportunity to decommoditize its services better present its content make more targeted offerings better retain its customers enhance its brand and lower its ticket distribution costs agency sales are primarily sold using global distribution systems gds united has developed and expects to continue to develop capabilities to sell certain ancillary products through the gds channel to provide an enhanced buying experience for customers who purchase in that channel 

industry conditions 

domestic competition  the domestic airline industry is highly competitive and dynamic the companys competitors consist primarily of other airlines and to a certain extent other forms of transportation currently any us carrier deemed fit by the us department of transportation the dot is largely free to operate scheduled passenger service between any two points within the united states competition can be direct in the form of another carrier flying the exact nonstop route or indirect where a carrier serves the same two cities nonstop from an alternative airport in that city or via an itinerary requiring a connection at another airport air carriers cost structures are not uniform and there are numerous factors influencing cost structure carriers with lower costs may offer lower fares to passengers which could have a potential negative impact on the companys revenues decisions on domestic pricing are based on intense competitive pressure exerted on the company by other us airlines in order to remain competitive and maintain passenger traffic levels we often find it necessary to match competitors discounted fares since we compete in a dynamic marketplace attempts to generate additional revenue through increased fares oftentimes fail 

international competition  internationally the company competes not only with us airlines but also with foreign carriers international competition has increased and may continue to increase in the future as a result of airline mergers and acquisitions jbas alliances restructurings liberalization of aviation bilateral agreements and new or increased service by competitors including government subsidized competitors from certain middle east countries competition on international routes is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation the companys ability to compete successfully with nonus carriers on international routes depends in part on its ability to generate traffic to and from the entire united states via its integrated domestic route network and its ability to overcome business and operational challenges across its network worldwide foreign carriers currently are prohibited by us law from carrying local passengers between two points in the united states and the company generally experiences comparable restrictions in foreign countries separately fifth freedom rights allow the company to operate between points in two different foreign countries and foreign carriers may also have fifth freedom rights between the us and another foreign country in the absence of fifth freedom rights or some other extrabilateral right to conduct operations between two foreign countries us carriers are constrained from carrying passengers to points beyond designated international gateway cities to compensate partially for these structural limitations us and foreign carriers have entered into alliances immunized jbas and marketing arrangements that enable these carriers to exchange traffic between each others flights and route networks see alliances  above for additional information 

seasonality  the air travel business is subject to seasonal fluctuations historically demand for air travel is higher in the second and third quarters driving higher revenues than in the first and fourth quarters which are periods of lower travel demand 

industry regulation 

domestic regulation 

all carriers engaged in air transportation in the united states are subject to regulation by the dot absent an exemption no air carrier may provide air transportation of passengers or property without first being issued a dot certificate of public convenience and necessity the dot also grants international route authority approves international codeshare arrangements and regulates methods of competition the dot regulates consumer protection and maintains jurisdiction over advertising denied boarding compensation tarmac delays baggage liability and other areas and may add additional expensive regulatory burdens in the future the dot has launched investigations or claimed rulemaking authority to regulate commercial agreements among carriers or between carriers and third parties in a wide variety of contexts 

airlines are also regulated by the federal aviation administration the faa an agency within the dot primarily in the areas of flight safety air carrier operations and aircraft maintenance and airworthiness the faa issues air carrier operating certificates and aircraft airworthiness certificates prescribes maintenance procedures oversees airport operations and regulates pilot and other employee training from time to time the faa issues directives that require air carriers to inspect or modify aircraft and other equipment potentially causing the company to incur substantial unplanned expenses the airline industry is also subject to numerous other federal laws and regulations the us department of homeland security dhs has jurisdiction over virtually every aspect of civil aviation security the antitrust division of the us department of justice doj has jurisdiction over certain airline competition matters the us postal service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail by airlines labor relations in the airline industry are generally governed by the railway labor act rla a federal statute the company is also subject to investigation inquiries by the dot faa doj dhs the us food and drug administration fda the us department of agriculture usda and other us and international regulatory bodies 

airport access  access to landing and takeoff rights or slots at several major us airports served by the company are subject to government regulation federallymandated domestic slot restrictions that limit operations and regulate capacity currently apply at three airports reagan national airport in washington dc reagan national john f kennedy international airport and laguardia airport in the new york city metropolitan region laguardia of these three airports united currently operates at two reagan national and laguardia additional restrictions on takeoff and landing slots at these and other airports may be implemented in the future and could affect the companys rights of ownership and transfer as well as its operations 

legislation  the airline industry is subject to legislative actions or inactions that may have an impact on operations and costs in 2018 the us congress approved a fiveyear reauthorization for the faa which encompasses significant aviation tax and policyrelated issues the law includes a range of policy changes related to airline customer service and aviation safety which depending on how they are implemented could impact our operations and costs additionally the us congress may fail to continue to fund the operations of one or more federal government agencies which could negatively impact the company and the airline industry   

catering operations  the company owns and operates catering kitchens at airports in denver cleveland newark houston and honolulu which prepare readytoeat food for united flights some of the companys kitchens also prepare readytoeat food for other domestic and international airlines these operations are subject to regulation by the fda and the usda as well as other federal state and local regulatory agencies the fda has begun enforcing the federal food safety modernization act which requires all food manufacturers to implement stringent riskbased preventive controls as a result readytoeat catering operations are a focus of enhanced scrutiny by the fda with inspections and greater enforcement 

international regulation 

international air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation in connection with the companys international services the company is regulated by both the us government and the governments of the foreign countries the company serves in addition the availability of international routes to us carriers is regulated by aviation agreements between the us and foreign governments and in some cases fares and schedules require the approval of the dot andor the relevant foreign governments 

legislation foreign countries are increasingly enacting passenger protection laws rules and regulations that meet or exceed us requirements in cases where this activity exceeds us requirements additional burden and liability may be placed on the company certain countries have regulations requiring passenger compensation andor enforcement penalties from the company in addition to changes in operating procedures due to canceled and delayed flights 

airport access  historically access to foreign markets has been tightly controlled through bilateral agreements between the us and each foreign country involved these agreements regulate the markets served the number of carriers allowed to serve each market and the frequency of carriers flights since the early 1990s the us has pursued a policy of open skies meaning all usflag carriers have access to the destination under which the us government has negotiated a number of bilateral agreements allowing unrestricted access between us and foreign markets currently there are more than 100 open skies agreements in effect however even with open skies many of the airports that the company serves in europe asia and latin america maintain slot controls a large number of these slot controls exist due to congestion environmental and noise protection and reduced capacity due to runway and air traffic control atc construction work among other reasons london heathrow international airport frankfurt rheinmain airport shanghai pudong international airport beijing capital international airport sao paulo guarulhos international airport and tokyo haneda international airport are among the most restrictive foreign airports due to slot and capacity limitations 

the companys ability to serve some foreign markets and expand into certain others is limited by the absence of aviation agreements between the us government and the relevant foreign governments shifts in us or foreign government aviation policies may lead to the alteration or termination of air service agreements depending on the nature of any such change the value of the companys international route authorities and slot rights may be materially enhanced or diminished similarly foreign governments control their airspace and can restrict our ability to overfly their territory enhancing or diminishing the value of the companys existing international route authorities and slot rights 

environmental regulation 

the airline industry is subject to increasingly stringent federal state local and international environmental requirements including those regulating emissions to air water discharges safe drinking water and the use and management of hazardous substances and wastes 

climate change  there is an increasing global regulatory focus on greenhouse gas ghg emissions and their potential impacts relating to climate change initiatives to regulate ghg emissions from aviation had previously been adopted by the european union eu in 2009 but applicability to flights arriving or departing from airports outside the eu have been postponed several times in december 2017 the european parliament voted to extend exemptions for extraeu flights until december 2023 in order to align the extension date with the completion of the pilot phase of the international civil aviation organizations icao carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation corsia corsia which was adopted in october 2016 is intended to create a single global marketbased measure to achieve carbonneutral growth for international aviation after 2020 which can be achieved through airline purchases of carbon offset credits certain corsia program details remain to be developed and could potentially be affected by political developments in participating countries or the results of the pilot phase of the program and thus the impact of corsia cannot be fully predicted however corsia is expected to increase operating costs for airlines that operate internationally in 2016 icao also adopted a carbon dioxide co2 emission standard for aircraft in 2016 the us environmental protection agency epa commenced procedural steps necessary to adopt its own standard but the timing of further action by the epa is unknown while the precise timing and final form of these various programs and requirements continue to evolve in 2018 the company announced a pledge to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent relative to 2005 levels by the year 2050 and is taking various actions that are expected to help reduce its co2 emissions over time such as improving fuel efficiency fleet renewal aircraft retrofits and the commercialization of aviation alternative fuels 

other regulations  our operations are subject to a variety of other environmental laws and regulations both in the united states and internationally these include noiserelated restrictions on aircraft types and operating times and state and local air quality initiatives which have or could in the future result in curtailments in services increased operating costs limits on expansion or further emission reduction requirements certain airports andor governments both domestically and internationally either have or are seeking to establish environmental fees and other requirements applicable to carbon emissions local air quality pollutants andor noise the implementation of state plans to achieve national standards for ozone is expected to result in restrictions on mobile sources such as cars trucks and airport ground support equipment in some locations certain states may also elect to impose restrictions apart from the revised national standards finally environmental cleanup laws could require the company to undertake or subject the company to liability for investigation and remediation costs at certain owned or leased locations or thirdparty disposal locations 

until applicability of new regulations to our specific operations is better defined andor until pending regulations are finalized future costs to comply with such regulations will remain uncertain but are likely to increase our operating costs over time while we continue to monitor these developments the precise nature of future requirements and their applicability to the company are difficult to predict but the financial impact to the company and the aviation industry could be significant 

employees 

as of december 31 2018  ual including its subsidiaries had approximately 92000  employees approximately 83  of the companys employees were represented by various us labor organizations 

collective bargaining agreements between the company and its represented employee groups are negotiated under the rla such agreements typically do not contain an expiration date and instead specify an amendable date upon which the agreement is considered open for amendment 

the following table reflects the companys represented employee groups the number of employees per represented group union representation for each of uniteds employee groups and the amendable date for each employee groups collective bargaining agreement as of december 31 2018  

a on october 23 2018 uniteds catering operations employees voted to unionize under the rla in an election overseen by the national mediation board unite here received the majority of the votes and was officially certified to represent uniteds frontline catering operations employees the company expects contract negotiations to begin in 2019

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend the following risk factors should be read carefully when evaluating the companys business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this report and other statements the company or its representatives make from time to time any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect the companys business operating results financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this report 

if we do not successfully execute our strategic operating plan or if our strategic operating plan is unsuccessful our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

we have announced several strategic plans in recent years including several revenuegenerating initiatives and plans to optimize our revenue such as our plans to add capacity including international expansion and new or increased service to midsize airports and initiatives and plans to optimize and control our costs we also continue to explore opportunities to enhance our segmentation including the introduction of polaris basic economy and united premium plus and are implementing many programs and policies to improve the customer experience at all points in air travel in developing our strategic operating plan we make certain assumptions including but not limited to those related to customer demand competition market consolidation and the global economy actual economic market and other conditions may be different from our assumptions and we may not be able to successfully execute our strategic operating plan if we do not successfully execute our strategic operating plan or if actual results vary significantly from our assumptions our business operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted 

unfavorable economic and political conditions in the united states and globally may have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

the companys business and operating results are significantly impacted by us and global economic and political conditions the airline industry is highly cyclical and the level of demand for air travel is correlated to the strength of the us and global economies robust demand for the companys air transportation services depends largely on favorable economic conditions including the strength of the domestic and foreign economies low unemployment levels strong consumer confidence levels and the availability of consumer and business credit air transportation is often a discretionary purchase that leisure travelers may limit or eliminate during difficult economic times shorthaul travelers in particular have the option to replace air travel with surface travel in addition during periods of unfavorable economic conditions business travelers historically have reduced the volume of their travel either due to costsaving initiatives the replacement of travel with alternatives such as videoconferencing or as a result of decreased business activity requiring travel during such periods the companys business and operating results may be adversely affected due to significant declines in industry passenger demand particularly with respect to the companys business and premium cabin travelers and a reduction in fare levels 

as a global business with operations outside of the united states from which it derives significant operating revenues volatile conditions in certain international regions may have a negative impact on the companys operating results and its ability to achieve its business objectives the companys international operations are a vital part of its worldwide airline network political disruptions and instability in certain regions can negatively impact the demand and network availability for air travel 

stagnant or weakening global economic conditions either in the united states or in other geographic regions may have a material adverse effect on the companys revenues operating results and liquidity 

the global airline industry is highly competitive and susceptible to price discounting and changes in capacity which could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

the airline industry is highly competitive marked by significant competition with respect to routes fares schedules both timing and frequency services products customer service and frequent flyer programs consolidation in the airline industry the rise of wellfunded government sponsored international carriers changes in international alliances and the creation of immunized jbas have altered and are expected to continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with increased financial resources more extensive global networks and services and competitive cost structures 

airlines also compete by increasing or decreasing their capacity including route systems and the number of destinations served several of the companys domestic and international competitors have increased their international capacity by including service to some destinations that the company currently serves causing overlap in destinations served and therefore increasing competition for those destinations this increased competition in both domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on the companys business operating results and financial condition 

the companys us operations are subject to competition from traditional network carriers national pointtopoint carriers and discount carriers including lowcost carriers and ultralowcost carriers such carriers may have lower costs and provide service at lower fares to destinations also served by the company the significant presence of lowcost carriers which engage in substantial price discounting may diminish our ability to achieve sustained profitability on domestic and international routes our ability to compete in the domestic market effectively depends in part on our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure if we cannot maintain our costs at a competitive level then our business financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

our international operations are subject to competition from both foreign and domestic carriers competition is significant from government subsidized competitors from certain middle east countries these carriers have large numbers of international widebody aircraft on order and are increasing service to the us from their hubs in the middle east the government support provided to these carriers has allowed them to grow quickly reinvest in their product invest in other airlines and expand their global presence 

through alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements with foreign carriers us carriers have increased their ability to sell international transportation such as services to and beyond traditional european and asian gateway cities similarly foreign carriers have obtained increased access to interior us passenger traffic beyond traditional us gateway cities through these relationships in addition several jbas among us and foreign carriers have received grants of antitrust immunity allowing the participating carriers to coordinate schedules pricing sales and inventory if we are not able to continue participating in these types of alliance and other marketing and codesharing agreements in the future our business financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 

high andor volatile fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a material adverse impact on the companys strategic plans operating results financial condition and liquidity 

aircraft fuel is critical to the companys operations and is our single largest operating expense during the year ended december 31 2018 the companys fuel expense was 93 billion  the timely and adequate supply of fuel to meet operational demand depends on the continued availability of reliable fuel supply sources as well as related service and delivery infrastructure although the company has some ability to cover shortterm fuel supply and infrastructure disruptions at some major demand locations it depends significantly on the continued performance of its vendors and service providers to maintain supply integrity consequently the company can neither predict nor guarantee the continued timely availability of aircraft fuel throughout the companys system 

aircraft fuel has historically been the companys most volatile operating expense due to the highly unpredictable nature of market prices for fuel the company generally sources fuel at prevailing market prices market prices for aircraft fuel have historically fluctuated substantially in short periods of time and continue to be highly volatile due to a dependence on a multitude of unpredictable factors beyond the companys control these factors include changes in global crude oil prices the balance between aircraft fuel supply and demand natural disasters prevailing inventory levels and fuel production and transportation infrastructure prices of fuel are also impacted by indirect factors such as geopolitical events economic growth indicators fiscalmonetary policies fuel tax policies changes in regulations environmental concerns and financial investments in energy markets both actual changes in these factors as well as changes in market expectations of these factors can potentially drive rapid changes in fuel price levels in short periods of time 

given the highly competitive nature of the airline industry the company may not be able to increase its fares and fees sufficiently to offset the full impact of increases in fuel prices especially if these increases are significant rapid and sustained further any such fare or fee increase may not be sustainable may reduce the general demand for air travel and may also eventually impact the companys strategic growth and investment plans for the future in addition decreases in fuel prices for an extended period of time may result in increased industry capacity increased competitive actions for market share and lower fares or surcharges in general if fuel prices were to then subsequently rise quickly there may be a lag between the rise in fuel prices and any improvement of the revenue environment 

to protect against increases in the market prices of fuel the company may hedge a portion of its future fuel requirements the company does not currently hedge its future fuel requirements however to the extent the company decides to start a hedging program such hedging program may not be successful in mitigating higher fuel costs and any price protection provided may be limited due to choice of hedging instruments and market conditions including breakdown of correlation between hedging instrument and market price of aircraft fuel and failure of hedge counterparties to the extent that the company decides to hedge a portion of its future fuel requirements and uses hedge contracts that have the potential to create an obligation to pay upon settlement if fuel prices decline significantly such hedge contracts may limit the companys ability to benefit fully from lower fuel costs in the future if fuel prices decline significantly from the levels existing at the time the company enters into a hedge contract the company may be required to post collateral margin beyond certain thresholds there can be no assurance that the companys hedging arrangements if any will provide any particular level of protection against rises in fuel prices or that its counterparties will be able to perform under the companys hedging arrangements additionally deterioration in the companys financial condition could negatively affect its ability to enter into new hedge contracts in the future 

the company relies heavily on technology and automated systems to operate its business and any significant failure or disruption of the technology or these systems could materially harm its business 

the company depends on automated systems and technology to operate its business including but not limited to computerized airline reservation systems demand prediction software flight operations systems revenue management systems accounting systems technical and business operations systems telecommunication systems and commercial websites and applications including wwwunitedcom and the united airlines app uniteds website and other automated systems must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic maintain secure information and deliver important flight and schedule information as well as process critical financial transactions these systems could suffer substantial or repeated disruptions due to various events some of which are beyond the companys control including natural disasters power failures terrorist attacks equipment or software failures computer viruses or cyber security attacks substantial or repeated systems failures or disruptions including failures or disruptions related to the companys complex integration of systems could reduce the attractiveness of the companys services versus those of its competitors materially impair its ability to market its services and operate its flights result in the unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information result in increased costs lost revenue and the loss or compromise of important data and may adversely affect the companys business operating results and financial condition 

the companys business relies extensively on thirdparty service providers including certain technology providers failure of these parties to perform as expected or interruptions in the companys relationships with these providers or their provision of services to the company could have an adverse effect on the companys business operating results and financial condition 

the company has engaged thirdparty service providers to perform a large number of functions that are integral to its business including regional operations operation of customer service call centers distribution and sale of airline seat inventory provision of information technology infrastructure and services transmitting or uploading of data provision of aircraft maintenance and repairs provision of various utilities performance of aircraft fueling operations and catering services among other vital functions and services the company does not directly control these thirdparty service providers although it does enter into agreements that define expected service performance 

any of these thirdparty service providers however may materially fail to meet its service performance commitments to the company or may suffer disruptions to its systems that could impact its services for example failures in certain thirdparty technology or communications systems may cause flight delays or cancellations the failure of any of the companys thirdparty service providers to perform its service obligations adequately or other interruptions of services may reduce the companys revenues and increase its expenses prevent the company from operating its flights and providing other services to its customers or result in adverse publicity or harm to its brand in addition the companys business and financial performance could be materially harmed if its customers believe that its services are unreliable or unsatisfactory 

the company may also have disagreements with such providers or such contracts may be terminated or may not be extended or renewed for example the number of flight reservations booked through thirdparty gdss or online travel agents otas may be adversely affected by disruptions in the business relationships between the company and these suppliers such disruptions including a failure to agree upon acceptable contract terms when contracts expire or otherwise become subject to renegotiation may cause the companys flight information to be limited or unavailable for display by the affected gds or ota operator significantly increase fees for both the company and gdsota users and impair the companys relationships with its customers and travel agencies any such disruptions or contract terminations may adversely impact our operations and financial results 

if we are not able to negotiate or renew agreements with thirdparty service providers or if we renew existing agreements on less favorable terms our operations and financial results may be adversely affected 

the company could experience adverse publicity harm to its brand reduced travel demand and potential tort liability as a result of an accident catastrophe or incident involving its aircraft or its operations the aircraft or operations of its regional carriers the aircraft or operations of its codeshare partners or the aircraft or operations of another airline which may result in a material adverse effect on the companys business operating results and financial condition 

an accident catastrophe or incident involving an aircraft that the company operates or an aircraft that is operated by a codeshare partner one of the companys regional carriers or another airline or an incident involving the companys operations or the operations of a codeshare partner one of the companys regional carriers or of another airline could have a material adverse effect on the company if such accident catastrophe or incident created a public perception that the companys operations or the operations of its codeshare partners or regional carriers are not safe or reliable or are less safe or reliable than other airlines such public perception could in turn result in adverse publicity for the company cause harm to the companys brand and reduce travel demand on the companys flights or the flights of its codeshare partners or regional carriers 

in addition any such accident catastrophe or incident involving the company its regional carriers or its codeshare partners could expose the company to significant tort liability although the company currently maintains liability insurance in amounts and of the type the company believes to be consistent with industry practice to cover damages arising from any such accident catastrophe or incident and the companys codeshare partners and regional carriers carry similar insurance and generally indemnify the company for their operations if the companys liability exceeds the applicable policy limits or the ability of another carrier to indemnify it the company could incur substantial losses from an accident catastrophe or incident which may result in a material adverse effect on the companys operating results and financial condition 

terrorist attacks international hostilities or other security events or the fear of terrorist attacks or hostilities even if not made directly on the airline industry could negatively affect the company and the airline industry 

terrorist attacks or international hostilities even if not made on or targeted directly at the airline industry or the fear of or the precautions taken in anticipation of such attacks including elevated national threat warnings travel restrictions selective cancellation or redirection of flights and new security regulations could materially and adversely affect the company and the airline industry security events pose a significant risk to our passenger and cargo operations these events could include acts of violence in public areas that we cannot control the companys financial resources may not be sufficient to absorb the 

adverse effects of any future terrorist attacks international hostilities or other security events any such events could have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition liquidity and operating results 

increasing privacy and data security obligations or a significant data breach may adversely affect the companys business 

the company is subject to increasing legislative regulatory and customer focus on privacy issues and data security also a number of the companys commercial partners including credit card companies have imposed data security standards that the company must meet these standards continue to evolve the company will continue its efforts to meet its privacy and data security obligations however it is possible that certain new obligations may be difficult to meet and could increase the companys costs 

additionally the company must manage evolving cybersecurity risks our network systems and storage applications and those systems and storage and other business applications maintained by our thirdparty providers may be subject to attempts to gain unauthorized access breach malfeasance or other system disruptions in some cases it is difficult to anticipate or to detect immediately such incidents and the damage caused thereby while we continually work to safeguard our internal network systems and validate the security of our thirdparty providers including through information security policies and employee awareness and training there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyberattacks or security breaches the loss disclosure misappropriation of or access to customers employees or business partners information or the companys failure to meet its obligations could result in legal claims or proceedings penalties and remediation costs a significant data breach or the companys failure to meet its obligations may adversely affect the companys reputation business operating results and financial condition 

disruptions to our regional network and united express flights provided by thirdparty regional carriers could adversely affect our business operating results and financial condition 

the company has contractual relationships with various regional carriers to provide regional aircraft service branded as united express these regional operations are an extension of the companys mainline network and complement the companys operations by carrying traffic that connects to mainline service and allows flights to smaller cities that cannot be provided economically with mainline aircraft the companys business and operations are dependent on its regional flight network with regional capacity accounting for approximately 11  of the companys total capacity for the year ended december 31 2018  

although the company has agreements with its regional carriers that include contractually agreed performance metrics each regional carrier is a separately certificated commercial air carrier and the company does not control the operations of these carriers a number of factors may impact the companys regional network including weatherrelated effects and seasonality in addition the decrease in qualified pilots driven by changes to federal regulations has adversely impacted and could continue to affect the companys regional flying for example the faas expansion of minimum pilot qualification standards including a requirement that a pilot have at least 1500 total flight hours as well as the faas revised pilot flight and duty time requirements under part 117 of the federal aviation regulations have contributed to a smaller supply of pilots available to regional carriers the decrease in qualified pilots resulting from the regulations as well as factors including a decreased student pilot population and a shrinking us military from which to hire qualified pilots could adversely impact the companys operations and financial condition and could also require the company to reduce regional carrier flying 

if a significant disruption occurs to the companys regional network or flights or if one or more of the regional carriers with which the company has relationships is unable to perform their obligations over an extended period of time there could be a material adverse effect on the companys business financial condition and operating results 

current or future litigation and regulatory actions or failure to comply with the terms of any settlement order or arrangement relating to these actions could have a material adverse impact on the company 

from time to time we are subject to litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings relating to our business or investigations or other actions by governmental agencies including as described in part i item 3 legal proceedings of this report no assurances can be given that the results of these or new matters will be favorable to us an adverse resolution of lawsuits arbitrations investigations or other proceedings or actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results including as a result of nonmonetary remedies and could also result in adverse publicity defending ourselves in these matters may be timeconsuming expensive and disruptive to normal business operations and may result in significant expense and a diversion of managements time and attention from the operation of our business which could impede our ability to achieve our business objectives additionally any amount that we may be required to pay to satisfy a judgment settlement fine or penalty may not be covered by insurance if we fail to comply with the terms contained in any settlement order or agreement with a governmental authority relating to these matters we could be subject to criminal or civil penalties which could have a material adverse impact on the company under our charter and certain indemnification agreements that we have entered into and may in the future enter into with our officers directors and certain third parties we 

could be required to indemnify and advance expenses to them in connection with their involvement in certain actions suits investigations and other proceedings there can be no assurance that any of these payments will not be material 

our significant investments in other airlines including in other parts of the world and the commercial relationships that we have with those carriers may not produce the returns or results we expect 

an important part of our strategy to expand our global network includes making significant investments in airlines in other parts of the world and expanding our commercial relationships with these carriers for example in november 2018 united entered into a revenuesharing joint business agreement with avianca copa and several of their respective affiliates subject to regulatory approval concurrently with this transaction united advanced a loan of 456 million to affiliates of synergy aerospace corporation synergy the majority shareholder of avianca holdings sa avh the parent company of avianca and entered into certain other related agreements including a put arrangement with aviancas significant minority shareholder kingsland holdings limited kingsland the loan is secured by a pledge of synergys equity and synergys shares of avh stock and the loan and other agreements contain several provisions whereby the company may acquire avh stock we also have an equity investment in azul see note 9 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information regarding our investments in avianca and azul 

we also have investments in several domestic regional airlines in january 2019 we completed the acquisition of a 499 interest in manaair llc which as of immediately following the closing of that investment owns 100 of the equity interests in expressjet airlines inc a domestic regional airline we also have minority equity interests in commutair and republic airways holdings inc see note 9 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information regarding our investments in regional airlines 

we expect to continue exploring similar noncontrolling investments in and entering into jbas commercial agreements loan transactions and strategic alliances with other carriers as part of our regional and global business strategy these transactions and relationships involve significant challenges and risks we are dependent on these other carriers for significant aspects of our network in the regions in which they operate while we work closely with these carriers each is a separately certificated commercial air carrier and we do not have control over their operations strategy management or business methods these airlines also are subject to a number of the same risks as our business which are described in this item 1a risk factors including competitive pressures on pricing demand and capacity changes in aircraft fuel pricing and the impact of global and local political and economic conditions on operations and customer travel patterns among others 

as a result of these and other factors we may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment and we may not receive repayment of any invested or loaned funds further these investments may not generate the revenue or operational synergies we expect and they may distract management focus from our operations or other strategic options finally our reliance on these other carriers in the regions in which they operate may negatively impact our regional and global operations and results if those carriers are impacted by general business risks or perform below our expectations or needs any one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition 

we may also be subject to consequences from any improper behavior of jba partners including for failure to comply with anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act furthermore our relationships with these carriers may be subject to the laws and regulations of nonus jurisdictions in which these carriers are located or conduct business any political or regulatory change in these jurisdictions that negatively impact or prohibit our arrangements with these carriers could have an adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition to the extent that the operations of any of these carriers are disrupted over an extended period of time or their actions subject us to the consequences of failure to comply with laws and regulations our operating results may be adversely affected 

the airline industry may undergo further change with respect to alliances and jbas or due to consolidations any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company 

the company faces and may continue to face strong competition from other carriers due to the modification of alliances and formation of new jbas carriers may improve their competitive positions through airline alliances slot swaps andor jbas certain types of airline jbas further competition by allowing multiple airlines to coordinate routes pool revenues and costs and enjoy other mutual benefits achieving many of the benefits of consolidation open skies agreements including the longstanding agreements between the united states and each of the eu canada japan korea new zealand australia colombia and panama as well as the more recent agreements between the united states and each of mexico and brazil may also give rise to better integration opportunities among international carriers movement of airlines between current global airline alliances could reduce joint network coverage for members of such alliances while also creating opportunities for jbas and bilateral alliances that did not exist before such realignment further airline and airline alliance consolidations or reorganizations could occur in the future the company routinely engages in analyses and discussions regarding its own strategic position including current and potential alliances asset acquisitions and divestitures and may have future discussions 

with other airlines regarding strategic activities if other airlines participate in such activities those airlines may significantly improve their cost structures or revenue generation capabilities thereby potentially making them stronger competitors of the company and potentially impairing the companys ability to realize expected benefits from its own strategic relationships 

orders for new aircraft typically must be placed years in advance of scheduled deliveries and changes in the companys network strategy over time may make aircraft on order less economic for the company result in costs related to modification or termination of aircraft orders or cause the company to enter into orders for new aircraft on less favorable terms 

the companys orders for new aircraft are typically made years in advance of actual delivery of such aircraft and the financial commitment required for purchases of new aircraft is substantial at december 31 2018  the company had firm commitments to purchase 273  new aircraft from the boeing company boeing airbus sas airbus and embraer sa embraer as well as related agreements with engine manufacturers maintenance providers and others as of december 31 2018  the companys commitments relating to the acquisition of aircraft and related spare engines aircraft improvements and other related obligations aggregated to a total of 247 billion  

subsequent to the company placing an order for new aircraft the companys network strategy may change as a result the companys preference for a particular aircraft that it has ordered often years in advance may be decreased or eliminated if the company were to modify or terminate any of its existing aircraft order commitments it may be responsible for material liabilities to its counterparties arising from any such change additionally the company may have a need for additional aircraft that are not available under its existing orders in such cases the company may seek to acquire aircraft from other sources such as through lease arrangements which may result in higher costs or less favorable terms or through the purchase or lease of used aircraft the company may not be able to acquire such aircraft when needed on favorable terms or at all 

a majority of the companys aircraft and certain parts are sourced from single suppliers therefore the company would be materially and adversely affected if it were unable to obtain additional equipment or support from any of these suppliers 

the company currently sources the majority of its aircraft and many related aircraft parts from boeing in addition our aircraft suppliers are dependent on other suppliers for certain other aircraft parts therefore if the company was unable to acquire additional aircraft from boeing or if boeing was unable or unwilling to make timely deliveries of aircraft or to provide adequate support for its products the companys operations could be materially and adversely affected the company is also dependent on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft engines and certain other aircraft parts and could therefore also be materially and adversely affected in the event of the unavailability of these engines and other parts 

union disputes employee strikes or slowdowns and other laborrelated disruptions could adversely affect the companys operations and could result in increased costs that impair its financial performance 

united is a highly unionized company as of december 31 2018  the company and its subsidiaries had approximately 92000  active employees of whom approximately 83  were represented by various us labor organizations 

there is a risk that unions or individual employees might pursue judicial or arbitral claims arising out of changes implemented as a result of the company entering into collective bargaining agreements with its represented employee groups there is also a possibility that employees or unions could engage in job actions such as slowdowns worktorule campaigns sickouts or other actions designed to disrupt the companys normal operations in an attempt to pressure the company in collective bargaining negotiations although the rla makes such actions unlawful until the parties have been lawfully released to selfhelp and the company can seek injunctive relief against premature selfhelp such actions can cause significant harm even if ultimately enjoined in addition collective bargaining agreements with the companys represented employee groups increase the companys labor costs which increase could be material for any applicable reporting period 

an outbreak of a disease or similar public health threat could have a material adverse impact on the companys business operating results and financial condition 

an outbreak of a disease or similar public health threat that affects travel demand travel behavior or travel restrictions could have a material adverse impact on the companys business financial condition and operating results 

if we experience changes in or are unable to retain our senior management team or other key employees our operating results could be adversely affected 

much of our future success depends on the continued availability of skilled personnel with industry experience and knowledge including our senior management team and other key employees if we are unable to attract and retain talented highly qualified senior management and other key employees or if we are unable to effectively provide for the succession of senior management our business may be adversely affected 

extended interruptions or disruptions in service at major airports where we operate could have a material adverse impact on our operations 

the airline industry is heavily dependent on business models that concentrate operations in major airports in the united states and throughout the world an extended interruption or disruption at an airport where we have significant operations could have a material impact on our business financial condition and results of operation 

we operate principally through our domestic hubs in at newark chicago ohare denver houston bush lax guam sfo and washington dulles substantially all of our flights either originate in or fly into one of these locations a significant interruption or disruption in service at one of our hubs or other airports where we have a significant presence resulting from atc delays weather conditions natural disasters growth constraints relations with thirdparty service providers failure of computer systems disruptions to government agencies or personnel disruptions at airport facilities or other key facilities used by us to manage our operations labor relations power supplies fuel supplies terrorist activities international hostilities or otherwise could result in the cancellation or delay of a significant portion of our flights and as a result could have a material impact on our business operating results and financial condition we have minimal control over the operation quality or maintenance of these services or whether vendors will improve or continue to provide services that are essential to our business 

the airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation which imposes significant costs and may adversely impact our business operating results and financial condition 

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal oversight compliance with us and international regulations imposes significant costs and may have adverse effects on the company laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges both domestically and internationally have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce airline revenue 

united provides air transportation under certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by the dot if the dot altered amended modified suspended or revoked these certificates it could have a material adverse effect on the companys business the faa regulates the safety of uniteds operations united operates pursuant to an air carrier operating certificate issued by the faa the faas regulations include stringent pilot flight and duty time requirements under part 117 of the federal aviation regulations as well as minimum qualifications for air carrier first officers these regulations have caused mainline airlines to hire regional pilots while simultaneously significantly reducing the pool of new pilots from which regional carriers themselves can hire although this is an industry issue it directly affects the company and has required it to reduce regional partner flying as several regional partners have experienced difficulty flying their schedules due to reduced pilot availability from time to time the faa also issues orders airworthiness directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require material expenditures or operational restrictions by the company these faa orders and directives could include the temporary grounding of an entire aircraft type if the faa identifies design manufacturing maintenance or other issues requiring immediate corrective action these faa directives or requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company 

in 2018 the us congress approved a fiveyear reauthorization for the faa which encompasses significant aviation tax and policyrelated issues the law includes a range of policy changes related to airline customer service and aviation safety which depending on how they are implemented could impact our operations and costs additionally the us congress may fail to continue to fund the operations of one or more federal government agencies which could negatively impact the company and the airline industry   

the companys operations may also be adversely impacted due to the existing antiquated atc system utilized by the us government and regulated by the faa during peak travel periods in certain markets the current atc systems inability to handle demand has led to shortterm capacity constraints imposed by government agencies and resulted in delays and disruptions of air traffic in addition the current system will not be able to effectively handle projected future air traffic growth the outdated technologies also cause the atc to be less resilient in the event of a failure causing flight cancellations and delays imposition of these atc constraints on a longterm basis may have a material adverse effect on the companys operations failure to update the atc system in a timely manner and the substantial funding requirements of a modernized atc system that may be imposed on air carriers may have an adverse impact on the companys financial condition or operating results 

access to landing and takeoff rights or slots at several major us airports and many foreign airports served by the company are or recently have been subject to government regulation certain of the companys major hubs are among the most congested airports in the united states and have been or could be the subject of regulatory action that might limit the number of flights andor increase costs of operations at certain times or throughout the day the faa may limit the companys 

airport access by limiting the number of departure and arrival slots at high density traffic airports which could affect the companys ownership and transfer rights and local airport authorities may have the ability to control access to certain facilities or the cost of access to their facilities which could have an adverse effect on the companys business the faa historically has taken actions with respect to airlines slot holdings that airlines have challenged if the faa were to take actions that adversely affect the companys slot holdings the company could incur substantial costs to preserve its slots or may lose slots if slots are eliminated at an airport or if the number of hours of operation governed by slots is reduced at an airport the lack of controls on takeoffs and landings could result in greater congestion both at the affected airport or in the regional airspace eg the new york city metropolitan region airspace and could significantly impact the companys operations further the companys operating costs at airports including the companys major hubs may increase significantly because of capital improvements at such airports that the company may be required to fund directly or indirectly such costs could be imposed by the relevant airport authority without the companys approval and may have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition 

the ability of carriers to operate flights on international routes between the united states and other countries is highly regulated applicable arrangements between the united states and foreign governments may be amended from time to time government policies with respect to airport operations may be revised and the availability of appropriate slots or facilities may change the company currently operates a number of flights on international routes under government arrangements regulations or policies that designate the number of carriers permitted to operate on such routes the capacity of the carriers providing services on such routes the airports at which carriers may operate international flights or the number of carriers allowed access to particular airports any limitations additions or modifications to such arrangements regulations or policies could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition and operating results additionally a change in law regulation or policy for any of the companys international routes such as open skies could have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition and operating results and could result in the impairment of material amounts of related tangible and intangible assets in addition competition from revenuesharing jbas and other alliance arrangements by and among other airlines could impair the value of the companys business and assets on the open skies routes the companys plans to enter into or expand us antitrust immunized alliances and jbas on various international routes are subject to receipt of approvals from applicable us federal authorities and obtaining other applicable foreign government clearances or satisfying the necessary applicable regulatory requirements there can be no assurance that such approvals and clearances will be granted or will continue in effect upon further regulatory review or that changes in regulatory requirements or standards can be satisfied 

see part i item 1 business—industry regulation of this report for additional information on government regulation impacting the company 

we are subject to many forms of environmental regulation and liability and risks associated with climate change and may incur substantial costs as a result 

many aspects of the companys operations are subject to increasingly stringent federal state local and international laws protecting the environment including those relating to emissions to the air water discharges safe drinking water and the use and management of hazardous materials and wastes compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures and violations can lead to significant fines and penalties in addition from time to time we are identified as a responsible party for environmental investigation and remediation costs under applicable environmental laws due to the disposal of hazardous substances generated by our operations we could also be subject to environmental liability claims from various parties including airport authorities related to our operations at our leased premises or the offsite disposal of waste generated at our facilities 

we may incur substantial costs as a result of changes in weather patterns due to climate change increases in the frequency severity or duration of severe weather events such as thunderstorms hurricanes flooding typhoons tornados and other severe weather events could result in increases in delays and cancellations turbulencerelated injuries and fuel consumption to avoid such weather any of which could result in significant loss of revenue and higher costs 

to address climate change risks corsia has been developed by icao a un specialized agency corsia is intended to create a single global marketbased measure to achieve carbonneutral growth for international aviation after 2020 through airline purchases of carbon offset credits certain corsia program details remain to be developed and could potentially be affected by political developments in participating countries or the results of the pilot phase of the program and thus the impact of corsia cannot be fully predicted however corsia is expected to increase operating costs for airlines that operate internationally 

in addition to corsia the epa had begun preliminary work to adopt its own aircraft engine ghg emission standards which were expected to be aligned with recent icao carbon dioxide emission standards the timing of any us epa aircraft engine ghg emission standards is currently unknown but some jurisdictions in which united operates have adopted or are considering ghg emission reduction initiatives which could impact various aspects of the companys business the precise 

nature of future requirements and their applicability to the company are difficult to predict but the financial impact to the company and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant 

see part i item 1 businessindustry regulationenvironmental regulation of this report for additional information on environmental regulation impacting the company 

the united kingdoms withdrawal from the eu may adversely impact our operations in the united kingdom and elsewhere 

in june 2016 united kingdom uk voters approved an advisory referendum for the uk to exit the eu the uk parliament voted in favor of allowing the government to commence negotiations to determine the future terms of the uks relationship with the eu including the terms of trade between the uk and the eu and other nations the timing of the proposed exit is currently scheduled for march 29 2019 with a transition period potentially running through december 2020 a withdrawal plan was presented to the uk parliament in january 2019 and rejected creating further uncertainty in negotiations and the process of withdrawal 

depending on the outcome of these negotiations we could face new challenges in our operations such as instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets this instability could include volatility in the value of the british pound and european euro additional travel restrictions on passengers traveling between the uk and other eu countries changes to the legal status of euresident employees legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations at this time we cannot predict the impact that an actual exit from the eu will have on our business generally and our uk and european operations more specifically and no assurance can be given that our operating results financial condition and prospects would not be adversely impacted by the result 

the companys operating results fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors associated with the airline industry many of which are beyond the companys control 

due to greater demand for air travel during the spring and summer months revenues in the airline industry in the second and third quarters of the year are generally stronger than revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year which are periods of lower travel demand the companys operating results generally reflect this seasonality but have also been impacted by numerous other factors that are not necessarily seasonal including among others extreme or severe weather outbreaks of disease or pandemics atc congestion geological events political instability terrorism natural disasters changes in the competitive environment due to industry consolidation tax obligations general economic conditions and other factors as a result the companys quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year and historical operating results in a quarterly or annual period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 

increases in insurance costs or inadequate insurance coverage may materially and adversely impact our business operating results and financial condition 

the company could be exposed to significant liability or loss if its property or operations were to be affected by a natural catastrophe or other event including aircraft accidents the company maintains insurance policies including but not limited to terrorism aviation hull and liability workers compensation and property and business interruption insurance but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business if the company is unable to obtain sufficient insurance with acceptable terms the costs of such insurance increase materially or if the coverage obtained is insufficient relative to actual liability or losses that the company experiences whether due to insurance market conditions policy limitations and exclusions or otherwise its operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

the company has a significant amount of financial leverage from fixed obligations and insufficient liquidity may have a material adverse effect on the companys financial condition and business 

the company has a significant amount of financial leverage from fixed obligations including aircraft lease and debt financings leases of airport property and other facilities and other material cash obligations in addition the company has substantial noncancelable commitments for capital expenditures including for the acquisition of new aircraft and related spare engines 

although the companys cash flows from operations and its available capital including the proceeds from financing transactions have been sufficient to meet these obligations and commitments to date the companys future liquidity could be negatively affected by the risk factors discussed in this report if the companys liquidity is materially diminished the company might not be able to timely pay its leases and debts or comply with certain operating and financial covenants under its financing and credit card processing agreements or with other material provisions of its contractual obligations 

the companys substantial level of indebtedness and noninvestment grade credit rating as well as market conditions and the availability of assets as collateral for loans or other indebtedness may make it difficult for the company to raise additional capital if needed to meet its liquidity needs on acceptable terms or at all in addition our variable rate indebtedness may use

are issued by united and secured by its aircraft the payment obligations under the equipment notes are those of united proceeds received from the sale of passthrough certificates are initially held by a depositary in escrow for the benefit of the certificate holders until united issues equipment notes to the trust which purchases such notes with a portion of the escrowed funds these escrowed funds are not guaranteed by united and are not reported as debt on uniteds consolidated balance sheet because the proceeds held by the depositary are not uniteds assets in february 2019 united completed a 10 billion eetc offering to finance certain 2018 and 2019 aircraft deliveries see note 10 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information 

increased cost provisions  in uniteds financing transactions that include loans united typically agrees to reimburse lenders for any reduced returns with respect to the loans due to any change in capital requirements and in the case of loans in which the interest rate is based on libor for certain other increased costs that the lenders incur in carrying these loans as a result of any change in law subject in most cases to obligations of the lenders to take certain limited steps to mitigate the requirement for or the amount of such increased costs at december 31 2018 the company had 35 billion  of floating rate debt and 27 million  of fixed rate debt with remaining terms of up to 12 years that are subject to these increased cost provisions in several financing transactions involving loans or leases from nonus entities with remaining terms of up to 12 years  and an aggregate balance of 32 billion  the company bears the risk of any change in tax laws that would subject loan or lease payments thereunder to nonus entities to withholding taxes subject to customary exclusions 

fuel consortia   united participates in numerous fuel consortia with other air carriers at major airports to reduce the costs of fuel distribution and storage interline agreements govern the rights and responsibilities of the consortia members and provide for the allocation of the overall costs to operate the consortia based on usage the consortia and in limited cases the participating carriers have entered into longterm agreements to lease certain airport fuel storage and distribution facilities that are typically financed through taxexempt bonds either special facilities lease revenue bonds or general airport revenue bonds issued by various local municipalities in general each consortium lease agreement requires the consortium to make lease payments in amounts sufficient to pay the maturing principal and interest payments on the bonds as of december 31 2018 approximately 17 billion  principal amount of such bonds were secured by significant fuel facility leases in which united participates as to which united and each of the signatory airlines has provided indirect guarantees of the debt as of december 31 2018 the companys contingent exposure was approximately 164 million  principal amount of such bonds based on its recent consortia participation the companys contingent exposure could increase if the participation of other air carriers decreases the guarantees will expire when the taxexempt bonds are paid in full which ranges from 2022  to 2051  the company did not record a liability at the time these indirect guarantees were made 

critical accounting policies 

critical accounting policies are defined as those that are affected by significant judgments and uncertainties which potentially could result in materially different accounting under different assumptions and conditions the company has prepared the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions the company has identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of the financial statements 

frequent flyer accounting uniteds mileageplus loyalty program builds customer loyalty by offering awards benefits and services to program participants members in this program earn miles for travel on united united express star alliance members and certain other airlines that participate in the program members can also earn miles by purchasing the goods and services of our network of nonairline partners we have contracts to sell miles to these partners with the terms extending from one to eight years these partners include domestic and international credit card issuers retail merchants hotels car rental companies and our participating airline partners miles can be redeemed for free other than taxes and government imposed fees discounted or upgraded air travel and nontravel awards miles expire after 18 months of member account inactivity   

miles earned in conjunction with travel  when frequent flyers earn miles for flights the company recognizes a portion of the ticket sales as revenue when the travel occurs and defers a portion of the ticket sale representing the value of the related miles as a separate performance obligation the company determines the estimated selling price of travel and miles as if each element is sold on a separate basis the total consideration from each ticket sale is then allocated to each of these elements individually on a prorata basis at the time of travel the company records the portion allocated to the miles to frequent flyer deferred revenue on the companys consolidated balance sheet and subsequently recognizes it into revenue when miles are redeemed for air travel and nonair travel awards   

the companys estimated selling price of miles is based on an equivalent ticket value less breakage which incorporates the expected redemption of miles as the best estimate of selling price for these miles the equivalent ticket value is based on the prior 12 months weighted average equivalent ticket value of similar fares as those used to settle award redemptions while 

taking into consideration such factors as redemption pattern cabin class loyalty status and geographic region the estimated selling price of miles is adjusted by breakage that considers a number of factors including redemption patterns of various customer groups the company reviews its breakage estimates annually based upon the latest available information regarding redemption and expiration patterns the companys estimate of the expected expiration of miles requires significant management judgment current and future changes to expiration assumptions or to the expiration policy or to program rules and program redemption opportunities may result in material changes to the deferred revenue balance as well as recognized revenues from the program for the portion of the outstanding miles that we estimate will not be redeemed we recognize the associated value proportionally as the remaining miles are redeemed   

  cobrand agreement  united has a significant contract the cobrand agreement to sell mileageplus miles to its cobranded credit card partner chase bank usa na chase chase awards miles to mileageplus members based on their credit card activity united identified the following significant separately identifiable performance obligations in the cobrand agreement   

 

we account for all the payments received including monthly and onetime payments under the cobrand agreement by allocating them to the separately identifiable performance obligations the fair value of the separately identifiable performance obligations is determined using managements estimated selling price of each component the objective of using the estimated selling price based methodology is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis accordingly we determine our best estimate of selling price by considering multiple inputs and methods including but not limited to discounted cash flows brand value volume discounts published selling prices number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed the company estimated the selling prices and volumes over the term of the cobrand agreement in order to determine the allocation of proceeds to each of the components to be delivered we also evaluate volumes on an annual basis which may result in a change in the allocation of the estimated consideration from the cobrand agreement on a prospective basis 

frequent flyer deferred revenue   miles in mileageplus members accounts are combined into one homogeneous pool and are thus not separately identifiable for award redemption purposes between miles earned in the current period and those in their beginning balance of the miles expected to be redeemed the company expects the majority of these miles to be redeemed within two years   

the following table summarizes information related to the companys frequent flyer deferred revenue liability 

revenue recognition   the company presents passenger revenue cargo revenue and other operating revenue on its income statement passenger revenue is recognized when transportation is provided and cargo revenue is recognized when shipments arrive at their destination other operating revenue is recognized as the related performance obligations are satisfied   

passenger tickets and related ancillary services sold by the company for mainline and regional flights are purchased primarily via credit card transactions with payments collected by the company in advance of the performance of related services the company initially records ticket sales in its advance ticket sales liability deferring revenue recognition until the travel occurs for travel that has more than one flight segment the company deems each segment as a separate performance obligation and recognizes revenue for each segment as travel occurs tickets sold by other airlines where the company provides the 

transportation are recognized as passenger revenue at the estimated value to be billed to the other airline when travel is provided differences between amounts billed and the actual amounts may be rejected and rebilled or written off if the amount recorded was different from the original estimate when necessary the company records a reserve against its billings and payables with other airlines based on historical experience   

the company sells certain tickets with connecting flights with one or more segments operated by its other airline partners for segments operated by its other airline partners the company has determined that it is acting as an agent on behalf of the other airlines as they are responsible for their portion of the contract ie transportation of the passenger the company as the agent recognizes revenue within other operating revenue at the time of the travel for the net amount representing commission to be retained by the company for any segments flown by other airlines   

refundable tickets expire after one year from the date of issuance nonrefundable tickets generally expire on the date of the intended travel unless the date is extended by notification from the customer on or before the intended travel date   the company records breakage revenue on the travel date for its estimate of tickets that will expire unused to determine breakage the company uses its historical experience with refundable and nonrefundable expired tickets and other facts such as recent aging trends program changes and modifications that could affect the ultimate expiration patterns of tickets fees charged in association with changes or extensions to nonrefundable tickets are considered part of the companys passenger travel obligation as such those fees are deferred at the time of collection and recognized at the time the travel is provided   

united initially capitalizes the costs of selling airline travel tickets and then recognizes those costs as distribution expense at the time of travel passenger ticket costs include credit card fees travel agency and other commissions paid as well as global distribution systems booking fees   

longlived assets the net book value of operating property and equipment for the company was 28 billion  and 26 billion  at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively the assets recorded value is impacted by a number of accounting policy elections including the estimation of useful lives and residual values and when necessary the recognition of asset impairment charges 

the company records assets acquired including aircraft at acquisition cost depreciable life is determined through economic analysis such as reviewing existing fleet plans obtaining appraisals and comparing estimated lives to other airlines that operate similar fleets the company has generally estimated the lives of those aircraft to be between 25 and 30 years residual values are estimated based on historical experience with regard to the sale of both aircraft and spare parts and are established in conjunction with the estimated useful lives of the related fleets residual values are based on when the aircraft are acquired and typically reflect asset values that have not reached the end of their physical life both depreciable lives and residual values are revised periodically as facts and circumstances arise to recognize changes in the companys fleet plan and other relevant information a oneyear increase in the average depreciable life of the companys flight equipment would reduce annual depreciation expense on flight equipment by approximately 85 million 

the company evaluates the carrying value of longlived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist for purposes of this testing the company has generally identified the aircraft fleet type as the lowest level of identifiable cash flows for purposes of testing aircraft for impairment an impairment charge is recognized when the assets carrying value exceeds its net undiscounted future cash flows and its fair market value the amount of the charge is the difference between the assets carrying value and fair market value 

see note 14 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information 

indefinitelived intangible assets the company has indefinitelived intangible assets including goodwill goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis as of october 1 or on an interim basis whenever a triggering event occurs an impairment occurs when the fair value of an intangible asset is less than its carrying value 

see note 2 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information 

defined benefit plan accounting we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees the most critical assumptions impacting our defined benefit pension plan obligations and expenses are the weighted average discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on the plan assets 

uniteds pension plans underfunded status was 16 billion  at december 31 2018  funding requirements for taxqualified defined benefit pension plans are determined by government regulations in 2019  we anticipate contributing at least 318 million to our pension plans the fair value of the plans assets was 38 billion  at december 31 2018  

when calculating pension expense for 2019  the company assumed that its plans assets would generate a longterm rate of return of approximately 74  the expected longterm rate of return assumption was developed based on historical experience and input from the trustee managing the plans assets   the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of assets which is based on a goal of earning the highest rate of return while maintaining risk at acceptable levels our projected longterm rate of return reflects the active management of our plans assets the plans strive to have assets sufficiently diversified so that adverse or unexpected results from one security class will not have an unduly detrimental impact on the entire portfolio plan fiduciaries regularly review actual asset allocation and the pension plans investments are periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 

the defined benefit pension plans assets consist of return generating investments and risk mitigating investments which are held through direct ownership or through interests in common collective trusts return generating investments include primarily equity securities fixedincome securities and alternative investments eg private equity and hedge funds risk mitigating investments include primarily us government and investment grade corporate fixedincome securities the allocation of assets was as follows at december 31 2018  

pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases lowering the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets by 50 basis points from 74  to 69  would increase estimated 2019  pension expense by approximately 20 million  future pension obligations for uniteds plans were discounted using a weighted average rate of 42  at december 31 2018  the company selected the discount rate for substantially all of its plans by using a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds at december 31 2018  that would provide the necessary cash flows to match the projected benefit payments the pension liability and future pension expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points from 42  to 37  would increase the pension liability at december 31 2018  by approximately 585   million and increase the estimated 2019  pension expense by approximately 69 million future changes in plan asset returns plan provisions assumed discount rates pension funding law and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future 

actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions under the applicable accounting standards for defined benefit pension plans those gains and losses are not required to be recognized currently as pension benefit expense but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into expense over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees all gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are amortized to expense over the remaining years of service of the covered active employees at december 31 2018  and 2017  the company had unrecognized actuarial losses for pension benefit plans of 14 billion  and 16 billion  respectively recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 

other postretirement benefit plan accounting uniteds postretirement plan provides certain health care benefits primarily in the united states to retirees and eligible dependents as well as certain life insurance benefits to certain retirees reflected as other benefits united also has retiree medical programs that permit retirees who meet certain age and service requirements to continue medical coverage between retirement and medicare eligibility eligible employees are required to pay a portion of the costs of their retiree medical benefits which in some cases may be offset by accumulated unused sick time at the time of their retirement plan benefits are subject to copayments deductibles and other limits as described in the plans 

the company accounts for other postretirement benefits by recognizing the difference between plan assets and obligations or the plans funded status in its financial statements other postretirement benefit expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods and is generally calculated independently of funding decisions or requirements united has not been required to prefund its plan obligations which has resulted in a significant net obligation as discussed below the companys benefit obligation was 14 billion  and 17 billion  for the other postretirement benefit plans at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively 

the calculation of other postretirement benefit expense and obligations requires the use of a number of assumptions including the assumed discount rate for measuring future payment obligations and the health care cost trend rate the company determines the appropriate discount rate for each of the plans based on current rates on high quality corporate bonds that would generate the cash flow necessary to pay plan benefits when due the companys weighted average discount rate to determine its 

benefit obligations as of december 31 2018  was 430  as compared to 363  for december 31 2017  the health care cost trend rate assumed for 2018  was 625  declining to 50  in 2023 as compared to assumed trend rate for 2019  of 60  declining to 50  in 2023 a 1 increase in assumed health care trend rates would increase the companys total service and interest cost for the year ended december 31 2018  by 9 million whereas a 1 decrease in assumed health care trend rates would decrease the companys total service and interest cost for the year ended december 31 2018  by 7 million a one percentage point decrease in the weighted average discount rate would increase the companys postretirement benefit liability by approximately 139 million  and increase the estimated 2018 benefits expense by approximately 10 million  

actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions and prior service credits result from a retroactive reduction in benefits due under the plans under the applicable accounting standards for postretirement welfare benefit plans actuarial gains and losses and prior service credits are not required to be recognized currently but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into expense over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees or the average life expectancy of inactive participants at december 31 2018  and 2017  the company had unrecognized actuarial gains for postretirement welfare benefit plans of 554 million  and 301 million  respectively recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend interest rates our net income is affected by fluctuations in interest rates eg interest expense on variable rate debt and interest income earned on shortterm investments the companys policy is to manage interest rate risk through a combination of fixed and variable rate debt the following table summarizes information related to the companys interest rate market risk at december 31 in millions 

a change in market interest rates would also impact interest income earned on our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments assuming our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments remain at their average 2018  levels a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a corresponding increase in the companys interest income of approximately 45 million during 2019 

commodity price risk aircraft fuel  the price level of aircraft fuel can significantly affect the companys operations results of operations financial position and liquidity 

our operational and financial results can be significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel to provide adequate supplies of fuel the company routinely enters into purchase contracts that are customarily indexed to market prices for aircraft fuel and the company generally has some ability to cover shortterm fuel supply and infrastructure disruptions at some major demand locations the companys current strategy is to not enter into transactions to hedge fuel price volatility although the company regularly reviews its policy based on market conditions and other factors the companys 2019  forecasted fuel consumption is presently approximately 43 billion gallons and based on this forecast a onedollar change in the price of a barrel of crude oil would change the companys annual fuel expense by approximately  104 million  

foreign currency the company generates revenues and incurs expenses in numerous foreign currencies changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the companys results of operations through changes in the dollar value of foreign currencydenominated operating revenues and expenses some of the companys more significant foreign currency exposures include the canadian dollar chinese renminbi european euro british pound and japanese yen the companys current strategy is to not enter into transactions to hedge its foreign currency sales although the company regularly reviews its policy based on market conditions and other factors 

the result of a uniform 1 strengthening in the value of the us dollar from december 31 2018  levels relative to each of the currencies in which the company has foreign currency exposure would result in a decrease in pretax income of approximately 24 million for the year ending december 31 2019  this sensitivity analysis was prepared based upon projected 2019  foreign currencydenominated revenues and expenses as of december 31 2018

ventures with ana for transpacific cargo services and continues to implement a cargo joint venture with lufthansa for transatlantic cargo services these cargo joint ventures offer expanded and more seamless access to cargo space across the carriers’ respective combined networks

aircraft fuel the table below summarizes ual’s aircraft fuel consumption and expense during the last three years 

 

 our operational and financial results can be significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel to provide adequate supplies of fuel the company routinely enters into purchase contracts that are customarily indexed to market prices for aircraft fuel and the company generally has some ability to cover shortterm fuel supply and infrastructure disruptions at some major demand locations the price of aircraft fuel has fluctuated substantially in the past several years as of december 31 2017 the company did not have any outstanding fuel hedging contracts the company’s current strategy is to not enter into transactions to hedge its fuel consumption although the company regularly reviews its strategy based on market conditions and other factors 

thirdparty business united generates thirdparty business revenue that includes frequent flyer award nonair redemptions maintenance services catering and ground handling thirdparty business revenue is recorded in other operating revenue expenses associated with thirdparty business are recorded in other operating expenses 

distribution channels the company’s airline seat inventory and fares are distributed through the company’s direct channels traditional travel agencies and online travel agencies the use of the company’s direct sales website wwwunitedcom the company’s mobile applications and alternative distribution systems provides the company with an opportunity to decommoditize its services better present its content make more targeted offerings better retain its customers enhance its brand and lower its ticket distribution costs agency sales are 

 

primarily sold using global distribution systems “gds” united has developed capabilities to sell certain ancillary products through the gds channel to provide an enhanced buying experience for customers who purchase in that channel to increase the company’s opportunities to sell its full range of products and services and lower distribution costs the company will continue to develop new selling capabilities in thirdparty channels and expand the capabilities of its website and mobile applications 

industry conditions 

domestic competition the domestic airline industry is highly competitive and dynamic the company’s competitors consist primarily of other airlines and to a certain extent other forms of transportation currently any us carrier deemed fit by the dot is largely free to operate scheduled passenger service between any two points within the united states competition can be direct in the form of another carrier flying the exact nonstop route or indirect where a carrier serves the same two cities nonstop from an alternative airport in that city or via an itinerary requiring a connection at another airport air carriers’ cost structures are not uniform and there are numerous factors influencing cost structure carriers with lower costs may offer lower fares to passengers which could have a potential negative impact on the company’s revenues decisions on domestic pricing are based on intense competitive pressure exerted on the company by other us airlines in order to remain competitive and maintain passenger traffic levels we often find it necessary to match competitors’ discounted fares since we compete in a dynamic marketplace attempts to generate additional revenue through increased fares oftentimes fail 

international competition internationally the company competes not only with us airlines but also with foreign carriers international competition has increased and may continue to increase in the future as a result of airline mergers and acquisitions joint ventures alliances restructurings liberalization of aviation bilateral agreements and new or increased service by competitors including government subsidized competitors from certain middle east countries competition on international routes is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation the company’s ability to compete successfully with nonus carriers on international routes depends in part on its ability to generate traffic to and from the entire united states via its integrated domestic route network and its ability to overcome business and operational challenges across its network worldwide foreign carriers currently are prohibited by us law from carrying local passengers between two points in the united states and the company generally experiences comparable restrictions in foreign countries separately “fifth freedom rights” allow the company to operate between points in two different foreign countries and foreign carriers may also have fifth freedom rights between the us and another foreign country in the absence of fifth freedom rights or some other extrabilateral right to conduct operations between two foreign countries us carriers are constrained from carrying passengers to points beyond designated international gateway cities to compensate partially for these structural limitations us and foreign carriers have entered into alliances joint ventures and marketing arrangements that enable these carriers to exchange traffic between each other’s flights and route networks see alliances above for additional information 

seasonality the air travel business is subject to seasonal fluctuations historically demand for air travel is higher in the second and third quarters driving higher revenues than in the first and fourth quarters which are periods of lower travel demand 

industry regulation 

domestic regulation 

all carriers engaged in air transportation in the united states are subject to regulation by the dot absent an exemption no air carrier may provide air transportation of passengers or property without first being issued a dot certificate of public convenience and necessity the dot also grants international route authority approves international codeshare arrangements and regulates methods of competition the dot regulates consumer protection and maintains jurisdiction over advertising denied boarding compensation tarmac delays baggage liability and other areas and may add additional expensive regulatory burdens in the future the dot has 

 

launched investigations or claimed rulemaking authority to regulate commercial agreements among carriers or between carriers and third parties in a wide variety of contexts 

airlines are also regulated by the federal aviation administration the “faa” an agency within the dot primarily in the areas of flight safety air carrier operations and aircraft maintenance and airworthiness the faa issues air carrier operating certificates and aircraft airworthiness certificates prescribes maintenance procedures oversees airport operations and regulates pilot and other employee training from time to time the faa issues directives that require air carriers to inspect or modify aircraft and other equipment potentially causing the company to incur substantial unplanned expenses the airline industry is also subject to numerous other federal laws and regulations the us department of homeland security “dhs” has jurisdiction over virtually every aspect of civil aviation security the antitrust division of the us department of justice “doj” has jurisdiction over certain airline competition matters the us postal service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail by airlines labor relations in the airline industry are generally governed by the railway labor act “rla” a federal statute the company is also subject to investigation inquiries by the dot faa doj dhs the us food and drug administration “fda” the us department of agriculture “usda” and other us and international regulatory bodies 

airport access access to landing and takeoff rights or “slots” at several major us airports served by the company are or recently have been subject to government regulation federallymandated domestic slot restrictions that limit operations and regulate capacity currently apply at three airports reagan national airport in washington dc “reagan national” john f kennedy international airport and laguardia airport in the new york city metropolitan region “laguardia” of these three airports united currently operates at two reagan national and laguardia additional restrictions on takeoff and landing slots at these and other airports may be implemented in the future and could affect the company’s rights of ownership and transfer as well as its operations 

legislation  the airline industry is subject to legislative activity that may have an impact on operations and costs in 2018 the us congress will continue to consider legislation to reauthorize the faa which encompasses all significant aviation tax and policyrelated issues as with previous reauthorization legislation the us congress may consider a range of policy changes that could impact operations and costs finally aviation security continues to be the subject of legislative and regulatory action requiring changes to the company’s security processes potentially increasing the cost of its security procedures and affecting its operations 

catering operations  the company owns and operates catering kitchens at airports in denver cleveland newark houston and honolulu which prepare readytoeat food for united flights as well as other domestic and international airlines in addition the cleveland flight kitchen produces a small volume of food products for retail sale these operations are subject to regulation by the fda and the usda as well as other regulatory agencies the fda recently began implementing the federal food safety modernization act which requires all food manufacturers to implement more stringent preventive controls as a result airline catering operations have recently become the focus of enhanced scrutiny by the fda with inspections and greater enforcement 

international regulation 

international air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation in connection with the company’s international services the company is regulated by both the us government and the governments of the foreign countries the company serves in addition the availability of international routes to us carriers is regulated by aviation agreements between the us and foreign governments and in some cases fares and schedules require the approval of the dot andor the relevant foreign governments 

legislation foreign countries are increasingly enacting passenger protection laws rules and regulations that meet or exceed us requirements in cases where this activity exceeds us requirements additional burden and liability may be placed on the company certain countries have regulations requiring passenger compensation andor enforcement penalties from the company in addition to changes in operating procedures due to canceled and delayed flights 

 

airport access historically access to foreign markets has been tightly controlled through bilateral agreements between the us and each foreign country involved these agreements regulate the markets served the number of carriers allowed to serve each market and the frequency of carriers’ flights since the early 1990s the us has pursued a policy of “open skies” meaning all usflag carriers have access to the destination under which the us government has negotiated a number of bilateral agreements allowing unrestricted access between us and foreign markets currently there are more than 100 open skies agreements in effect however even with open skies many of the airports that the company serves in europe asia and latin america maintain slot controls a large number of these slot controls exist due to congestion environmental and noise protection and reduced capacity due to runway and air traffic control “atc” construction work among other reasons london heathrow international airport frankfurt rheinmain airport shanghai pudong international airport beijing capital international airport sao paulo guarulhos international airport and tokyo haneda international airport are among the most restrictive foreign airports due to slot and capacity limitations 

the company’s ability to serve some foreign markets and expand into certain others is limited by the absence of aviation agreements between the us government and the relevant foreign governments shifts in us or foreign government aviation policies may lead to the alteration or termination of air service agreements depending on the nature of any such change the value of the company’s international route authorities and slot rights may be materially enhanced or diminished similarly foreign governments control their airspace and can restrict our ability to overfly their territory enhancing or diminishing the value of the company’s existing international route authorities and slot rights 

environmental regulation 

the airline industry is subject to increasingly stringent federal state local and international environmental requirements including those regulating emissions to air water discharges safe drinking water and the use and management of hazardous substances and wastes 

climate change  there is an increasing global regulatory focus on greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions and their potential impacts relating to climate change initiatives to regulate ghg emissions from aviation had previously been adopted by the european union “eu” in 2009 but applicability to flights arriving or departing from airports outside the eu have been postponed several times in december 2017 the european parliament voted to extend exemptions for extraeu flights until december 2023 in order to align the extension date with the completion of the pilot phase of the international civil aviation organization’s “icao” carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation “corsia” corsia which was adopted in october 2016 is intended to create a single global marketbased measure to achieve carbonneutral growth for international aviation after 2020 which will be achieved through airline purchases of carbon offset credits certain corsia program details remain to be developed and could potentially be affected by political developments in participating countries or the results of the pilot phase of the program and thus the impact of corsia cannot be fully predicted however corsia is expected to increase operating costs for airlines that operate internationally in 2016 icao also adopted a carbon dioxide “co2” emission standard for aircraft the us environmental protection agency has commenced the procedural steps necessary to adopt its own standard in consultation with the icao while the precise timing and final form of these various programs and requirements continue to evolve the company is taking various actions that are expected to help to reduce its co2 emissions over time such as fleet renewal aircraft retrofits and the commercialization of aviation alternative fuels 

other regulations  our operations are subject to a variety of other environmental laws and regulations both in the united states and internationally these include noiserelated restrictions on aircraft types and operating times and state and local air quality initiatives which have or could in the future result in curtailments in services increased operating costs limits on expansion or further emission reduction requirements certain airports andor governments both domestically and internationally either have or are seeking to establish environmental fees and other requirements applicable to carbon emissions local air quality pollutants andor noise the implementation of state plans to achieve national standards for ozone is expected to result in restrictions on mobile sources such as cars trucks and airport ground support equipment in some locations 

 

certain states may also elect to impose restrictions apart from the revised national standards finally environmental cleanup laws could require the company to undertake or subject the company to liability for investigation and remediation costs at certain owned or leased locations or third party disposal locations 

until applicability of new regulations to our specific operations is better defined andor until pending regulations are finalized future costs to comply with such regulations will remain uncertain but are likely to increase our operating costs over time while we continue to monitor these developments the precise nature of future requirements and their applicability to the company are difficult to predict but the financial impact to the company and the aviation industry could be significant 

employees 

as of december 31 2017 ual including its subsidiaries had approximately 89800 employees approximately 80 of the company’s employees were represented by various us labor organizations 

collective bargaining agreements between the company and its represented employee groups are negotiated under the rla such agreements typically do not contain an expiration date and instead specify an amendable date upon which the agreement is considered “open for amendment” 

the following table reflects the company’s represented employee groups the number of employees per represented group union representation for each of united’s employee groups and the amendable date for each employee group’s collective bargaining agreement as of december 31 2017 

 

 unite here is attempting to organize united’s catering operations employees who are currently unrepresented and filed an application to do so with the national mediation board on january 24 2018

 item 1a risk factors tableend the following risk factors should be read carefully when evaluating the company’s business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this report and other statements the company or its representatives make from time to time any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect the company’s business operating results financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this report 

global economic political and industry conditions constantly change and unfavorable conditions may have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations 

the company’s business and results of operations are significantly impacted by global economic and industry conditions the airline industry is highly cyclical and the level of demand for air travel is correlated to the strength of the us and global economies the company is a global business with operations outside of the united states from which it derives significant operating revenues the company’s international operations are a vital part of its worldwide airline network volatile economic political and market conditions in these international regions may have a negative impact on the company’s operating results and its ability to achieve its business objectives 

robust demand for the company’s air transportation services depends largely on favorable economic conditions including the strength of the domestic and foreign economies low unemployment levels strong consumer confidence levels and the availability of consumer and business credit air transportation is often a discretionary purchase that leisure travelers may limit or eliminate during difficult economic times in addition during periods of unfavorable economic conditions business travelers usually reduce the volume of their travel either due to costsaving initiatives or as a result of decreased business activity requiring travel during such periods the company’s business and results of operations may be adversely affected due to significant declines in industry passenger demand particularly with respect to the company’s business and premium cabin travelers and a reduction in fare levels 

stagnant or weakening global economic conditions either in the united states or in other geographic regions and any future volatility in us and global financial and credit markets may have a material adverse effect on the company’s revenues results of operations and liquidity if such economic conditions were to disrupt capital markets in the future the company may be unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all to refinance certain maturing debt and to satisfy future capital commitments 

in june 2016 united kingdom “uk” voters voted for the uk to exit the eu the uk parliament voted in favor of allowing the government to commence negotiations to determine the future terms of the uk’s relationship with the eu including the terms of trade between the uk and the eu and other nations a process of negotiation is now taking place to determine the future terms of the uk’s relationship with the eu depending on the outcome of these negotiations we could face new challenges in our operations such as instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets including volatility in the value of the british pound and european euro additional travel restrictions on passengers traveling between the uk and other eu countries and legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations these adverse effects in european market conditions could negatively impact the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition significant or volatile changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies may have a material adverse impact upon the company’s liquidity revenues costs and operating results 

the airline industry is highly competitive and susceptible to price discounting and changes in capacity which could have a material adverse effect on the company 

the us airline industry is characterized by substantial price competition including from lowcost carriers the significant market presence of lowcost carriers which engage in substantial price discounting may diminish our ability to achieve sustained profitability on domestic and international routes 

 

airlines also compete for market share by increasing or decreasing their capacity including route systems and the number of markets served several of the company’s domestic and international competitors have increased their international capacity by including service to some destinations that the company currently serves causing overlap in destinations served and therefore increasing competition for those destinations this increased competition in both domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

terrorist attacks or international hostilities or the fear of terrorist attacks or hostilities even if not made directly on the airline industry could negatively affect the company and the airline industry 

the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 involving commercial aircraft severely and adversely impacted the company’s financial condition and results of operations as well as the prospects for the airline industry among the effects experienced from the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks were substantial flight disruption costs caused by the faaimposed temporary grounding of the us airline industry’s fleet significantly increased security costs and associated passenger inconvenience increased insurance costs substantially higher ticket refunds and significantly decreased traffic and passenger revenue 

additional terrorist attacks even if not made directly on the airline industry or the fear of or the precautions taken in anticipation of such attacks including elevated national threat warnings travel restrictions or selective cancellation or redirection of flights could materially and adversely affect the company and the airline industry wars and other international hostilities could also have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition liquidity and results of operations the company’s financial resources may not be sufficient to absorb the adverse effects of any future terrorist attacks or other international hostilities 

increasing privacy and data security obligations or a significant data breach may adversely affect the company’s business 

the company is subject to increasing legislative regulatory and customer focus on privacy issues and data security also a number of the company’s commercial partners including credit card companies have imposed data security standards that the company must meet and these standards continue to evolve the company will continue its efforts to meet its privacy and data security obligations however it is possible that certain new obligations may be difficult to meet and could increase the company’s costs additionally the company must manage evolving cybersecurity risks the loss disclosure misappropriation of or access to customers’ employees’ or business partners’ information or the company’s failure to meet its obligations could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties a significant data breach or the company’s failure to meet its obligations may adversely affect the company’s reputation business results of operations and financial condition 

the company relies heavily on technology and automated systems to operate its business and any significant failure or disruption of the technology or these systems could materially harm its business 

the company depends on automated systems and technology to operate its business including computerized airline reservation systems flight operations systems revenue management systems accounting systems telecommunication systems and commercial websites including wwwunitedcom united’s website and other automated systems must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic maintain secure information and deliver important flight and schedule information as well as process critical financial transactions these systems could suffer substantial or repeated disruptions due to various events some of which are beyond the company’s control including natural disasters power failures terrorist attacks equipment or software failures computer viruses or cyber security attacks substantial or repeated systems failures or disruptions including failures or disruptions related to the company’s complex integration of systems could reduce the attractiveness of the company’s services versus those of its competitors materially impair its ability to market its services and operate its flights result in the unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information result in increased costs lost revenue and the loss or compromise of important data and may adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

 

current or future litigation and regulatory actions or failure to comply with the terms of any settlement order or arrangement relating to these actions could have a material adverse impact on the company 

from time to time we are subject to litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings relating to our business or investigations or other actions by governmental agencies including as described in part i item 3 legal proceedings of this report no assurances can be given that the results of these or new matters will be favorable to us an adverse resolution of lawsuits arbitrations investigations or other proceedings or actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations including as a result of nonmonetary remedies and could also result in adverse publicity defending ourselves in these matters may be timeconsuming expensive and disruptive to normal business operations and may result in significant expense and a diversion of management’s time and attention from the operation of our business which could impede our ability to achieve our business objectives additionally any amount that we may be required to pay to satisfy a judgment settlement fine or penalty may not be covered by insurance if we fail to comply with the terms contained in any settlement order or agreement with a governmental authority relating to these matters we could be subject to criminal or civil penalties which could have a material adverse impact on the company under our charter and certain indemnification agreements that we have entered into and may in the future enter into with our officers directors and certain third parties we could be required to indemnify and advance expenses to them in connection with their involvement in certain actions suits investigations and other proceedings there can be no assurance that any of these payments will not be material 

disruptions to the company’s regional network and united express flights provided by thirdparty regional carriers could adversely affect the company’s operations and financial condition 

the company has contractual relationships with various regional carriers to provide regional aircraft service branded as united express these regional operations are an extension of the company’s mainline network and complement the company’s operations by carrying traffic that connects to mainline service and allows flights to smaller cities that cannot be provided economically with mainline aircraft the company’s business and operations are dependent on its regional flight network with regional capacity accounting for approximately 11 of the company’s total capacity for the year ended december 31 2017 

although the company has agreements with its regional carriers that include contractually agreed performance metrics the company does not control the operations of these carriers a number of factors may impact the company’s regional network including weatherrelated effects and seasonality in addition the decrease in qualified pilots driven by federal regulations has adversely impacted and could continue to affect the company’s regional flying for example the faa’s expansion of minimum pilot qualification standards including a requirement that a pilot have at least 1500 total flight hours as well as the faa’s revised pilot flight and duty time rules effective january 2014 have contributed to a smaller supply of pilots available to regional carriers the decrease in qualified pilots resulting from the regulations as well as factors including a decreased student pilot population and a shrinking us military from which to hire qualified pilots could adversely impact the company’s operations and financial condition and also require the company to reduce regional carrier flying 

if a significant disruption occurs to the company’s regional network or flights or if one or more of the regional carriers with which the company has relationships is unable to perform their obligations over an extended period of time there could be a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and operations 

the company’s business relies extensively on thirdparty service providers failure of these parties to perform as expected or interruptions in the company’s relationships with these providers or their provision of services to the company could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the company has engaged thirdparty service providers to perform a large number of functions that are integral to its business including regional operations operation of customer service call centers distribution and sale of airline seat inventory provision of information technology infrastructure and services transmitting or uploading of data provision of aircraft maintenance and repairs provision of various utilities and performance of aircraft 

 

fueling operations and catering services among other vital functions and services the company does not directly control these thirdparty service providers although it does enter into agreements with most of them that define expected service performance any of these thirdparty service providers however may materially fail to meet their service performance commitments to the company may suffer disruptions to their systems that could impact their services or the agreements with such providers may be terminated for example flight reservations booked by customers and travel agencies via thirdparty gdss may be adversely affected by disruptions in the business relationships between the company and gds operators such disruptions including a failure to agree upon acceptable contract terms when contracts expire or otherwise become subject to renegotiation may cause the company’s flight information to be limited or unavailable for display significantly increase fees for both the company and gds users and impair the company’s relationships with its customers and travel agencies the failure of any of the company’s thirdparty service providers to perform their service obligations adequately or other interruptions of services may reduce the company’s revenues and increase its expenses prevent the company from operating its flights and providing other services to its customers or result in adverse publicity or harm to its brand in addition the company’s business and financial performance could be materially harmed if its customers believe that its services are unreliable or unsatisfactory 

orders for new aircraft typically must be placed years in advance of scheduled deliveries and changes in the company’s route network over time may make aircraft on order less economic for the company but any modification or termination of such orders could result in material liability for the company 

the company’s orders for new aircraft are typically made years in advance of actual delivery of such aircraft and the financial commitment required for purchases of new aircraft is substantial at december 31 2017 the company had firm commitments to purchase 228 new aircraft from the boeing company “boeing” and airbus sas “airbus” as well as related agreements with engine manufacturers maintenance providers and others at december 31 2017 the company’s commitments relating to the acquisition of aircraft and related spare engines aircraft improvements and other related obligations aggregated to a total of 222 billion 

subsequent to the company placing an order for new aircraft the company’s route network may change such that the aircraft on order become less economic to operate flights in the company’s network as a result the company’s preference for a particular aircraft that it has ordered often years in advance may be decreased or eliminated if the company were to seek to modify or terminate its existing aircraft order commitments it may be responsible for material obligations to its counterparties arising from any such change however the company expects that any such change that it makes would be in the longterm best economic interest of the company 

the company could experience adverse publicity harm to its brand reduced travel demand and potential tort liability as a result of an accident catastrophe or incident involving its aircraft or its operations the aircraft or operations of its regional carriers or the aircraft or operations of its codeshare partners which may result in a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial position 

an accident catastrophe or incident involving an aircraft that the company operates or an aircraft that is operated by a codeshare partner or one of the company’s regional carriers or an incident involving the company’s operations could have a material adverse effect on the company if such accident catastrophe or incident created a public perception that the company’s operations or the operations of its codeshare partners or regional carriers are not safe or reliable or are less safe or reliable than other airlines such public perception could in turn result in adverse publicity for the company cause harm to the company’s brand and reduce travel demand on the company’s flights or the flights of its codeshare partners or regional carriers 

in addition any such accident catastrophe or incident could expose the company to significant tort liability although the company currently maintains liability insurance in amounts and of the type the company believes to be consistent with industry practice to cover damages arising from any such accident or catastrophe and the company’s codeshare partners and regional carriers carry similar insurance and generally indemnify the company for their operations if the company’s liability exceeds the applicable policy limits or the ability of 

 

another carrier to indemnify it the company could incur substantial losses from an accident catastrophe or incident which may result in a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial position 

if we experience changes in or are unable to retain our senior management team or other key employees our operating results could be adversely affected 

much of our future success depends on the continued availability of skilled personnel with industry experience and knowledge including our senior management team and other key employees if we are unable to attract and retain talented highly qualified senior management and other key employees or if we are unable to effectively provide for the succession of senior management our business may be adversely affected 

high andor volatile fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a material adverse impact on the company’s strategic plans operating results financial position and liquidity 

aircraft fuel is critical to the company’s operations and is one of its single largest operating expenses the timely and adequate supply of fuel to meet operational demand depends on the continued availability of reliable fuel supply sources as well as related service and delivery infrastructure although the company has some ability to cover shortterm fuel supply and infrastructure disruptions at some major demand locations it can neither predict nor guarantee the continued timely availability of aircraft fuel throughout the company’s system the company generally sources fuel at prevailing market prices 

aircraft fuel has historically been the company’s most volatile operating expense due to the highly unpredictable nature of market prices for fuel market prices for aircraft fuel have historically fluctuated substantially in short periods of time and continue to be highly volatile due to a dependence on a multitude of unpredictable factors beyond the company’s control these factors include changes in global crude oil prices the balance between aircraft fuel supply and demand natural disasters prevailing inventory levels and fuel production and transportation infrastructure prices of fuel are also impacted by indirect factors that may potentially impact fuel supply or demand balance such as geopolitical events economic growth indicators fiscalmonetary policies fuel tax policies environmental concerns and financial investments in energy markets both actual changes in these factors as well as changes in market expectations of these factors can potentially drive rapid changes in fuel price levels in short periods of time 

given the highly competitive nature of the airline industry the company may not be able to increase its fares and fees sufficiently to offset the full impact of increases in fuel prices especially if these increases are significant rapid and sustained further any such fare and fee increases may not be sustainable may reduce the general demand for air travel and may also eventually impact the company’s strategic growth and investment plans for the future in addition decreases in fuel prices for an extended period of time may result in increased industry capacity increased competitive actions for market share and lower fares or surcharges in general if fuel prices were to then subsequently rise quickly there may be a lag between the rise in fuel prices and any improvement of the revenue environment 

to protect against increases in the market prices of fuel the company may hedge a portion of its future fuel requirements however the company’s hedging program may not be successful in mitigating higher fuel costs and any price protection provided may be limited due to choice of hedging instruments and market conditions including breakdown of correlation between hedging instrument and market price of aircraft fuel and failure of hedge counterparties to the extent that the company decides to hedge a portion of its future fuel requirements and uses hedge contracts that have the potential to create an obligation to pay upon settlement if fuel prices decline significantly such hedge contracts may limit the company’s ability to benefit fully from lower fuel costs in the future if fuel prices decline significantly from the levels existing at the time the company enters into a hedge contract the company may be required to post collateral margin beyond certain thresholds there can be no assurance that the company’s hedging arrangements will provide any particular level of protection against rises in fuel prices or that its counterparties will be able to perform under the company’s hedging arrangements 

 

additionally deterioration in the company’s financial condition could negatively affect its ability to enter into new hedge contracts in the future 

union disputes employee strikes or slowdowns and other laborrelated disruptions could adversely affect the company’s operations and could result in increased costs that impair its financial performance 

united is a highly unionized company as of december 31 2017 the company and its subsidiaries had approximately 89800 active employees of whom approximately 80 were represented by various us labor organizations 

there is a risk that unions or individual employees might pursue judicial or arbitral claims arising out of changes implemented as a result of the company entering into collective bargaining agreements with its represented employee groups there is also a possibility that employees or unions could engage in job actions such as slowdowns worktorule campaigns sickouts or other actions designed to disrupt the company’s normal operations in an attempt to pressure the company in collective bargaining negotiations although the rla makes such actions unlawful until the parties have been lawfully released to selfhelp and the company can seek injunctive relief against premature selfhelp such actions can cause significant harm even if ultimately enjoined in addition collective bargaining agreements with the company’s represented employee groups increase the company’s labor costs which increase could be material for any applicable reporting period 

an outbreak of a disease or similar public health threat could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business financial position and results of operations 

an outbreak of a disease or similar public health threat that affects travel demand travel behavior or travel restrictions could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

extensive government regulation could increase the company’s operating costs and restrict its ability to conduct its business 

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal oversight compliance with us and international regulations imposes significant costs and may have adverse effects on the company laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges both domestically and internationally have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce airline revenue 

united provides air transportation under certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by the dot if the dot altered amended modified suspended or revoked these certificates it could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business the faa regulates the safety of united’s operations united operates pursuant to an air carrier operating certificate issued by the faa in 2014 the faa’s more stringent pilot flight and duty time requirements under part 117 of the federal aviation regulations took effect which has increased costs for all carriers additionally minimum qualifications took effect for air carrier first officers these regulations will continue to impact the industry and the company for years to come as they have caused mainline airlines to hire regional pilots while simultaneously significantly reducing the pool of new pilots from which regional carriers themselves can hire although this is an industry issue it directly affects the company and requires it to reduce regional partner flying as several regional partners have experienced difficulty flying their schedules due to reduced pilot availability from time to time the faa also issues orders airworthiness directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require material expenditures or operational restrictions by the company these faa orders and directives could include the temporary grounding of an entire aircraft type if the faa identifies design manufacturing maintenance or other issues requiring immediate corrective action these faa directives or requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company 

in 2018 the us congress will continue to consider legislation to reauthorize the faa which encompasses all significant aviation tax and policy related issues as with previous reauthorization legislation the us congress may consider a range of policy changes that could impact the company’s operations and costs 

 

in addition the company’s operations may be adversely impacted due to the existing antiquated atc system utilized by the us government during peak travel periods in certain markets the current atc system’s inability to handle atc demand has led to shortterm capacity constraints imposed by government agencies and resulted in delays and disruptions of air traffic in addition the current system will not be able to effectively handle projected future air traffic growth imposition of these atc constraints on a longterm basis may have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations failure to update the atc system in a timely manner and the substantial funding requirements of a modernized atc system that may be imposed on air carriers may have an adverse impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

access to landing and takeoff rights or “slots” at several major us airports and many foreign airports served by the company are or recently have been subject to government regulation certain of the company’s major hubs are among the most congested airports in the united states and have been or could be the subject of regulatory action that might limit the number of flights andor increase costs of operations at certain times or throughout the day the faa may limit the company’s airport access by limiting the number of departure and arrival slots at high density traffic airports which could affect the company’s ownership and transfer rights and local airport authorities may have the ability to control access to certain facilities or the cost of access to their facilities which could have an adverse effect on the company’s business the faa historically has taken actions with respect to airlines’ slot holdings that airlines have challenged if the faa were to take actions that adversely affect the company’s slot holdings the company could incur substantial costs to preserve its slots or may lose slots if slots are eliminated at an airport or if the number of hours of operation governed by slots is reduced at an airport the lack of controls on takeoffs and landings could result in greater congestion both at the affected airport or in the regional airspace eg the new york city metropolitan region airspace and could significantly impact the company’s operations further the company’s operating costs at airports including the company’s major hubs may increase significantly because of capital improvements at such airports that the company may be required to fund directly or indirectly such costs could be imposed by the relevant airport authority without the company’s approval and may have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition 

many aspects of the company’s operations are also subject to increasingly stringent federal state local and international laws protecting the environment future environmental regulatory developments such as climate change regulations in the united states and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in the airline industry in addition there is the potential for additional regulatory actions in regard to the emission of ghgs by the aviation industry the precise nature of future requirements and their applicability to the company are difficult to predict but the financial impact to the company and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant 

see part i item 1 business—industry regulation of this report for additional information on government regulation impacting the company 

extensive government regulation on international routes could restrict the company’s ability to conduct its business and have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the ability of carriers to operate flights on international routes between the united states and other countries may be subject to change applicable arrangements between the united states and foreign governments may be amended from time to time government policies with respect to airport operations may be revised and the availability of appropriate slots or facilities may change the company currently operates a number of flights on international routes under government arrangements regulations or policies that designate the number of carriers permitted to operate on such routes the capacity of the carriers providing services on such routes the airports at which carriers may operate international flights or the number of carriers allowed access to particular airports any further limitations additions or modifications to such arrangements regulations or policies could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations additionally a change in law regulation or policy for any of the company’s international routes such as open skies could have a 

 

material adverse impact on the company’s financial position and results of operations and could result in the impairment of material amounts of related tangible and intangible assets in addition competition from revenuesharing joint ventures and other alliance arrangements by and among other airlines could impair the value of the company’s business and assets on the open skies routes the company’s plans to enter into or expand us antitrust immunized alliances and joint ventures on various international routes are subject to receipt of approvals from applicable us federal authorities and obtaining other applicable foreign government clearances or satisfying the necessary applicable regulatory requirements there can be no assurance that such approvals and clearances will be granted or will continue in effect upon further regulatory review or that changes in regulatory requirements or standards can be satisfied 

see part i item 1 business—industry regulation of this report for additional information on government regulation impacting the company 

the airline industry may undergo further change with respect to alliances and joint ventures or due to consolidations any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company 

the company faces and may continue to face strong competition from other carriers due to the modification of alliances and formation of new joint ventures carriers may improve their competitive positions through airline alliances slot swaps andor joint ventures certain types of airline joint ventures further competition by allowing multiple airlines to coordinate routes pool revenues and costs and enjoy other mutual benefits achieving many of the benefits of consolidation “open skies” agreements including the agreements between the united states and the eu and between the united states and japan may also give rise to better integration opportunities among international carriers movement of airlines between current global airline alliances could reduce joint network coverage for members of such alliances while also creating opportunities for joint ventures and bilateral alliances that did not exist before such realignment there is ongoing speculation that further airline and airline alliance consolidations or reorganizations could occur in the future especially if new “open skies” agreements between brazil and the united states are fully implemented the company routinely engages in analysis and discussions regarding its own strategic position including current and potential alliances asset acquisitions and divestitures and may have future discussions with other airlines regarding strategic activities if other airlines participate in such activities those airlines may significantly improve their cost structures or revenue generation capabilities thereby potentially making them stronger competitors of the company and potentially impairing the company’s ability to realize expected benefits from its own strategic relationships 

insufficient liquidity may have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position and business 

the company has a significant amount of financial leverage from fixed obligations including aircraft lease and debt financings leases of airport property and other facilities and other material cash obligations in addition the company has substantial noncancelable commitments for capital expenditures including for the acquisition of new aircraft and related spare engines 

although the company’s cash flows from operations and its available capital including the proceeds from financing transactions have been sufficient to meet these obligations and commitments to date the company’s future liquidity could be negatively affected by the risk factors discussed in this report including but not limited to substantial volatility in the price of fuel adverse economic conditions disruptions in the global capital markets and catastrophic external events 

if the company’s liquidity is materially diminished due to the various risk factors noted in this report or otherwise the company might not be able to timely pay its leases and debts or comply with certain operating and financial covenants under its financing and credit card processing agreements or with other material provisions of its contractual obligations certain of these covenants require the company or united as applicable to maintain minimum liquidity andor minimum collateral coverage ratios the company’s or united’s ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond its control including the overall industry revenue environment the level of fuel costs and the appraised value of the collateral 

 

if the company does not timely pay its leases and debts or comply with such covenants a variety of adverse consequences could result these potential adverse consequences include an increase of required reserves under credit card processing agreements withholding of credit card sale proceeds by its credit card service providers loss of undrawn lines of credit the occurrence of one or more events of default under the relevant agreements the acceleration of the maturity of debt andor the exercise of other remedies by its creditors and equipment lessors that could result in a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations the company cannot provide assurance that it would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance such debt if it were accelerated in addition an event of default or acceleration of debt under certain of its financing agreements could result in one or more events of default under certain of the company’s other financing agreements due to cross default and cross acceleration provisions 

furthermore insufficient liquidity may limit the company’s ability to withstand competitive pressures and downturns in the travel business and the economy in general 

the company’s substantial level of indebtedness and noninvestment grade credit rating as well as market conditions and the availability of assets as collateral for loans or other indebtedness may make it difficult for the company to raise additional capital if needed to meet its liquidity needs on acceptable terms or at all 

see part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report for additional information regarding the company’s liquidity 

increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage may materially and adversely impact the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

the company could be exposed to significant liability or loss if its property or operations were to be affected by a natural catastrophe or other event including aircraft accidents the company maintains insurance policies including but not limited to terrorism aviation hull and liability workers’ compensation and property and business interruption insurance but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business if the company is unable to obtain sufficient insurance with acceptable terms or if the coverage obtained is insufficient relative to actual liability or losses that the company experiences whether due to insurance market conditions policy limitations and exclusions or otherwise its results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

the company’s results of operations fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors associated with the airline industry 

due to greater demand for air travel during the spring and summer months revenues in the airline industry in the second and third quarters of the year are generally stronger than revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year which are periods of lower travel demand the company’s results of operations generally reflect this seasonality but have also been impacted by numerous other factors that are not necessarily seasonal including among others the imposition of excise and similar taxes extreme or severe weather atc congestion geological events natural disasters changes in the competitive environment due to industry consolidation general economic conditions and other factors as a result the company’s quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year and historical operating results in a quarterly or annual period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 

the company may never realize the full value of its intangible assets or its longlived assets causing it to record impairments that may negatively affect its financial position and results of operations 

in accordance with applicable accounting standards the company is required to test its indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred in addition the company is required to test certain of its other assets for impairment if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred 

 

the company may be required to recognize impairments in the future due to among other factors extreme fuel price volatility tight credit markets a decline in the fair value of certain tangible or intangible assets unfavorable trends in historical or forecasted results of operations and cash flows and an uncertain economic environment as well as other uncertainties the company can provide no assurance that a material impairment charge of tangible or intangible assets will not occur in a future period the value of the company’s aircraft could be impacted in future periods by changes in supply and demand for these aircraft such changes in supply and demand for certain aircraft types could result from grounding of aircraft by the company or other carriers an impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the company’s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for us federal income tax purposes may be significantly limited due to various circumstances including certain possible future transactions involving the sale or issuance of ual common stock or if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels 

as of december 31 2017 ual reported consolidated federal net operating loss “nol” carryforwards of approximately 24 billion 

the company’s ability to use its nol carryforwards may be limited if it experiences an “ownership change” as defined in section 382 “section 382” of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” an ownership change generally occurs if certain stockholders increase their aggregate percentage ownership of a corporation’s stock by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest percentage ownership at any time during the testing period which is generally the threeyear period preceding any potential ownership change 

there is no assurance that the company will not experience a future ownership change under section 382 that may significantly limit or possibly eliminate its ability to use its nol carryforwards potential future transactions involving the sale or issuance of ual common stock including the exercise of conversion options under the terms of any convertible debt that ual may issue in the future the repurchase of such debt with ual common stock any issuance of ual common stock for cash and the acquisition or disposition of such stock by a stockholder owning 5 or more of ual common stock or a combination of such transactions may increase the possibility that the company will experience a future ownership change under section 382 

under section 382 a future ownership change would subject the company to additional annual limitations that apply to the amount of preownership change nols that may be used to offset postownership change taxable income this limitation is generally determined by multiplying the value of a corporation’s stock immediately before the ownership change by the applicable longterm taxexempt rate any unused annual limitation may subject to certain limits be carried over to later years and the limitation may under certain circumstances be increased by builtin gains in the assets held by such corporation at the time of the ownership change this limitation could cause the company’s us federal income taxes to be greater or to be paid earlier than they otherwise would be and could cause all or a portion of the company’s nol carryforwards to expire unused similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes the company’s ability to use its nol carryforwards will also depend on the amount of taxable income it generates in future periods the company’s nol carryforwards may expire before it can generate sufficient taxable income to use them in full 

the final impacts of the tax cuts and jobs act could be materially different from our current estimates 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act was signed into law the “tax act” the tax act introduced significant changes to the code we continue to examine the impact the tax act may have on our business notwithstanding the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate as a result of tax act the estimated impact of the new law is based on management’s current knowledge and assumptions and recognized impacts could be materially different from current estimates based upon our further analysis of the new law 

 

our significant investments in airlines in other parts of the world and the commercial relationships that we have with those carriers may not produce the returns or results we expect 

an important part of our strategy to expand our global network includes making significant investments in airlines in other parts of the world and expanding our commercial relationships with these carriers in 2015 we made a 100 million investment in azul linhas aéreas brasileiras sa “azul” and enhanced our commercial arrangements with azul we expect to continue exploring similar noncontrolling investments in and entering into joint ventures commercial agreements loan transactions and strategic alliances with other carriers as part of our global business strategy these transactions and relationships including our strategic partnership with and investment in azul involve significant challenges and risks including that we may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment that we may not receive repayment of invested funds that they may distract management from our operations or that they may not generate the expected revenue synergies these events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition 

in addition we are dependent on these other carriers for significant aspects of our network in the regions in which they operate while we work closely with these carriers we do not have control over their operations or business methods we may be subject to consequences from any improper behavior of joint venture partners including for failure to comply with anticorruption laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act furthermore our relationships with these carriers may be subject to the laws and regulations of nonus jurisdictions in which these carriers are located or conduct business any political or regulatory change in these jurisdictions that negatively impact or prohibit our arrangements with these carriers could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition to the extent that the operations of any of these carriers are disrupted over an extended period of time or their actions subject us to the consequences of failure to comply with laws and regulations our results of operations may be adversely affected

 2017 operational highlights 

 

  

  

 outlook 

set forth below is a discussion of the principal matters that we believe could impact our financial and operating performance and cause our results of operations in future periods to differ materially from our historical operating results andor from our anticipated results of operations described in the forwardlooking statements in this report see part i item 1a risk factors of this report and the factors described under “forwardlooking information” below for additional discussion of these and other factors that could affect us 

in 2017 the company had its best operational performance in its postmerger history operational reliability service and experience underpin the company’s longterm strategy our priorities for 2018 are continued toptier operational reliability while strengthening our domestic network through growth driving efficiency and productivity and continued investment in our employees product and technology 

 

economic conditions the aviation industry in 2018 is expected to show continued growth in the demand for air travel passenger numbers are expected to increase cargo volumes are also expected to grow with some recovery in yields passenger revenue in all regions are expected to demonstrate improved performance in 2018 

capacity in 2018 the company expects its consolidated asms to grow between 4 and 6 yearoveryear most of this growth will be concentrated in our domestic network especially in our midcontinent hubs we believe greater scale and connectivity at our hubs reinforces our relevance and value proposition to our customers rebanking at our hubs is expected to drive significant additional connection opportunities we will also expand flights in nonpeak times of the year to more efficiently use our aircraft and facilities with the objective of driving an increase in profitability 

fuel the company’s average aircraft fuel price per gallon including related taxes was 174 in 2017 as compared to 149 in 2016 the price of jet fuel has increased since january 2016 and remains volatile based on projected fuel consumption in 2018 a one dollar change in the price of a barrel of crude oil would change the company’s annual fuel expense by approximately 96 million

other liquidity matters 

below is a summary of additional liquidity matters see the indicated notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional details related to these and other matters affecting our liquidity and commitments 

 

 contractual obligations the company’s business is capital intensive requiring significant amounts of capital to fund the acquisition of assets particularly aircraft in the past the company has funded the acquisition of aircraft through outright purchase by issuing debt by entering into capital or operating leases or through vendor financings the company also often enters into longterm lease commitments with airports to ensure access to terminal cargo maintenance and other required facilities 

the table below provides a summary of the company’s material contractual obligations as of december 31 2017 in billions 

 

        

offbalance sheet arrangements an offbalance sheet arrangement is any transaction agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has 1 made guarantees 2 a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets 3 an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or 4 any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support or that engages in leasing hedging or research and development arrangements the company’s primary offbalance sheet arrangements include operating leases which are summarized in the contractual obligations table under contractual obligations above and certain municipal bond obligations as discussed below 

as of december 31 2017 united had cash collateralized 75 million of letters of credit united also had 362 million of surety bonds securing various obligations at december 31 2017 most of the letters of credit have evergreen clauses and are expected to be renewed on an annual basis the surety bonds have expiration dates through 2021 

as of december 31 2017 united is the guarantor of approximately 18 billion in aggregate principal amount of taxexempt special facilities revenue bonds and interest thereon these bonds issued by various airport municipalities are payable solely from rentals paid under longterm agreements with the respective governing bodies the leasing arrangements associated with a majority of these obligations are accounted for as operating leases the leasing arrangements associated with a portion of these obligations are accounted for as capital leases the annual lease payments for those obligations are included in the contractual obligations table under contractual obligations above 

as of december 31 2017 united is the guarantor of 157 million of aircraft mortgage debt issued by one of united’s regional carriers the aircraft mortgage debt is subject to increased cost provisions and the company would potentially be responsible for those costs under the guarantees the increased cost provisions in the 157 million of aircraft mortgage debt are similar to those in certain of the company’s debt agreements see discussion under increased cost provisions below for additional information on increased cost provisions related to the company’s debt 

eetcs as of december 31 2017 united had 86 billion principal amount of equipment notes outstanding issued under eetc financings generally the structure of these eetc financings consists of passthrough trusts created by united to issue passthrough certificates which represent fractional undivided interests in the respective passthrough trusts and are not obligations of united the proceeds of the issuance of the passthrough certificates are used to purchase equipment notes which are issued by united and secured by its aircraft the payment obligations under the equipment notes are those of united proceeds received from the sale of passthrough certificates are initially held by a depositary in escrow for the benefit of the certificate holders until united issues equipment notes to the trust which purchases such notes with a portion of the escrowed funds these escrowed funds are not guaranteed by united and are not reported as debt on united’s consolidated balance sheet because the proceeds held by the depositary are not united’s assets 

increased cost provisions in united’s financing transactions that include loans united typically agrees to reimburse lenders for any reduced returns with respect to the loans due to any change in capital requirements and in the case of loans in which the interest rate is based on libor for certain other increased costs that the lenders incur in carrying these loans as a result of any change in law subject in most cases to obligations of the lenders to take certain limited steps to mitigate the requirement for or the amount of such increased costs at december 31 2017 the company had 34 billion of floating rate debt and 60 million of fixed rate debt with remaining terms of up to 11 years that are subject to these increased cost provisions in several financing transactions involving loans or leases from nonus entities with remaining terms of up to 11 years and an aggregate balance of 33 billion the company bears the risk of any change in tax laws that would subject loan or lease payments thereunder to nonus entities to withholding taxes subject to customary exclusions 

fuel consortia united participates in numerous fuel consortia with other air carriers at major airports to reduce the costs of fuel distribution and storage interline agreements govern the rights and responsibilities of the consortia members and provide for the allocation of the overall costs to operate the consortia based on usage the 

 

consortia and in limited cases the participating carriers have entered into longterm agreements to lease certain airport fuel storage and distribution facilities that are typically financed through taxexempt bonds either special facilities lease revenue bonds or general airport revenue bonds issued by various local municipalities in general each consortium lease agreement requires the consortium to make lease payments in amounts sufficient to pay the maturing principal and interest payments on the bonds as of december 31 2017 approximately 15 billion principal amount of such bonds were secured by significant fuel facility leases in which united participates as to which united and each of the signatory airlines has provided indirect guarantees of the debt as of december 31 2017 the company’s contingent exposure was approximately 244 million principal amount of such bonds based on its recent consortia participation the company’s contingent exposure could increase if the participation of other air carriers decreases the guarantees will expire when the taxexempt bonds are paid in full which ranges from 2022 to 2049 the company did not record a liability at the time these indirect guarantees were made 

critical accounting policies 

critical accounting policies are defined as those that are affected by significant judgments and uncertainties which potentially could result in materially different accounting under different assumptions and conditions the company has prepared the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions the company has identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of the financial statements 

revenue recognition the company records passenger ticket sales and tickets sold by other airlines for use on united as passenger revenue when the transportation is provided or upon estimated breakage the value of unused passenger tickets is included in current liabilities as advance ticket sales tickets sold by other airlines are recorded at the estimated values to be billed to the other airlines differences between amounts billed and the actual amounts may be rejected and rebilled or written off if the amount recorded was different from the original estimate when necessary the company records a reserve against its interline billings and payables if historical experience indicates that these amounts are different nonrefundable tickets generally expire on the date of the intended flight unless the date is extended by notification from the customer on or before the intended flight date basic economy tickets cannot be extended and refunds are not allowed except for ticket cancellations that are within 24 hours of purchase and one week or more prior to the original scheduled departure flight 

fees charged in association with changes or extensions to nonrefundable tickets are recorded as other revenue at the time the fee is incurred the fare on the changed ticket including any additional collection of fare is deferred and recognized in accordance with our transportation revenue recognition policy at the time the transportation is provided change fees related to nonrefundable tickets are considered a separate transaction from the air transportation because they represent a charge for the company’s additional service to modify a previous sale therefore the pricing of the change fee and the initial customer order are separately determined and represent distinct earnings processes 

the company records an estimate of breakage revenue on the flight date for tickets that will expire unused these estimates are based on the evaluation of actual historical results and forecasted trends refundable tickets expire after one year from the date of issuance 

the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 “topic 606”  topic 606 prescribes that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the standard impacts the classification of certain revenue streams and affects the timing of revenue and expense recognition for others for the company the most significant impact of the standard is the reclassification of certain ancillary fees from other operating revenue into passenger revenue on the statement of consolidated operations for 2016 and 2017 the amount to be 

 

reclassified at adoption of the new standard from other operating revenue into passenger revenue under topic 606 is approximately 20 billion and 21 billion respectively these ancillary fees are directly related to passenger travel such as ticket change fees and baggage fees and will no longer be considered distinct performance obligations separate from the passenger travel component in addition the ticket change fees which were previously recognized when received will be recognized when transportation is provided on january 1 2018 we adopted topic 606 using the fullretrospective approach see note 1 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information on recently issued accounting standards 

frequent flyer accounting united’s mileageplus program is designed to increase customer loyalty program participants earn miles by flying on united and certain other participating airlines program participants can also earn miles through purchases from other nonairline partners that participate in united’s loyalty program we sell miles to these partners which include domestic and international credit card issuers retail merchants hotels car rental companies and our participating airline partners miles can be redeemed for free other than taxes and government imposed fees discounted or upgraded air travel and nontravel awards the company records its obligation for future award redemptions using a deferred revenue model 

when frequent flyers earn miles for flights the company recognizes a portion of the ticket sales as revenue when the air transportation occurs and defers a portion of the ticket sale representing the value of the related miles as a multipledeliverable revenue arrangement the company determines the estimated selling price of air transportation and miles as if each element is sold on a separate basis the total consideration from each ticket sale is then allocated to each of these elements individually on a pro rata basis the miles are recorded in frequent flyer deferred revenue on the company’s consolidated balance sheet and recognized into revenue when the transportation is provided 

the company’s estimated selling price of miles is based on an equivalent ticket value less fulfillment discount which incorporates the expected redemption of miles as the best estimate of selling price for these miles the equivalent ticket value is based on the prior 12 months’ weighted average equivalent ticket value of similar fares as those used to settle award redemptions while taking into consideration such factors as redemption pattern cabin class loyalty status and geographic region the estimated selling price of miles is adjusted by a fulfillment discount that considers a number of factors including redemption patterns of various customer groups 

united has a significant contract to sell mileageplus miles to its cobranded credit card partner chase united identified the following significant revenue elements in its second amended and restated cobranded card marketing services agreement the “cobrand agreement” the air transportation element represented by the value of the mile generally resulting from its redemption for future air transportation and whose fair value is described above use of the united brand and access to mileageplus member lists advertising and other travel related benefits 

the fair value of the elements is determined using management’s estimated selling price of each element the objective of using the estimated selling price based methodology is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis accordingly we determine our best estimate of selling price by considering multiple inputs and methods including but not limited to discounted cash flows brand value volume discounts published selling prices number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed the company estimated the selling prices and volumes over the term of the cobrand agreement in order to determine the allocation of proceeds to each of the multiple elements to be delivered we also evaluate volumes on an annual basis which may result in a change in the allocation of estimated selling price on a prospective basis 

the company records passenger revenue related to the air transportation element when the transportation is delivered the other elements are generally recognized as other operating revenue when earned 

the company accounts for miles sold and awarded that will never be redeemed by program members which we refer to as breakage the company reviews its breakage estimates annually based upon the latest available information regarding redemption and expiration patterns miles expire after 18 months of member account 

 

inactivity the company’s estimate of the expected expiration of miles requires significant management judgment current and future changes to expiration assumptions or to the expiration policy or to program rules and program redemption opportunities may result in material changes to the deferred revenue balance as well as recognized revenues from the programs 

the following table summarizes information related to the company’s frequent flyer deferred revenue liability 

 

 longlived assets the net book value of operating property and equipment for the company was 26 billion and 23 billion at december 31 2017 and 2016 respectively the assets’ recorded value is impacted by a number of accounting policy elections including the estimation of useful lives and residual values and when necessary the recognition of asset impairment charges 

the company records assets acquired including aircraft at acquisition cost depreciable life is determined through economic analysis such as reviewing existing fleet plans obtaining appraisals and comparing estimated lives to other airlines that operate similar fleets the company has generally estimated the lives of those aircraft to be between 25 and 30 years residual values are estimated based on historical experience with regard to the sale of both aircraft and spare parts and are established in conjunction with the estimated useful lives of the related fleets residual values are based on when the aircraft are acquired and typically reflect asset values that have not reached the end of their physical life both depreciable lives and residual values are revised periodically as facts and circumstances arise to recognize changes in the company’s fleet plan and other relevant information a oneyear increase in the average depreciable life of the company’s flight equipment would reduce annual depreciation expense on flight equipment by approximately 76 million 

the company evaluates the carrying value of longlived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist for purposes of this testing the company has generally identified the aircraft fleet type as the lowest level of identifiable cash flows for purposes of testing aircraft for impairment an impairment charge is recognized when the asset’s carrying value exceeds its net undiscounted future cash flows and its fair market value the amount of the charge is the difference between the asset’s carrying value and fair market value 

see note 14 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information 

indefinitelived intangible assets the company has indefinitelived intangible assets including goodwill goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis as of october 1 or on an interim basis whenever a triggering event occurs an impairment occurs when the fair value of an intangible asset is less than its carrying value in 2017 the hong kong routes had a fair value cushion that was less than 10 of its carrying value the value of the routes was negatively impacted by the slowdown of the hong kong market coupled with industry oversupply as a result this intangible asset is susceptible to impairment risk from adverse changes in this particular market while management has implemented strategies to address the shifts in supply and demand dynamics further adverse changes could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair value and could trigger impairment charges of the hong kong routes

defined benefit plan accounting we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees the most critical assumptions impacting our defined benefit pension plan obligations and expenses are the weighted average discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on the plan assets 

united’s pension plans’ underfunded status was 19 billion at december 31 2017 funding requirements for taxqualified defined benefit pension plans are determined by government regulations in 2018 we anticipate 

 

contributing at least 420 million to our pension plans the fair value of the plans’ assets was 39 billion at december 31 2017 

when calculating pension expense for 2018 the company assumed that its plans’ assets would generate a longterm rate of return of approximately 73 the expected longterm rate of return assumption was developed based on historical experience and input from the trustee managing the plans’ assets the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of assets which is based on a goal of earning the highest rate of return while maintaining risk at acceptable levels our projected longterm rate of return reflects the active management of our plans’ assets the plans strive to have assets sufficiently diversified so that adverse or unexpected results from one security class will not have an unduly detrimental impact on the entire portfolio plan fiduciaries regularly review actual asset allocation and the pension plans’ investments are periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 

the defined benefit pension plans’ assets consist of return generating investments and risk mitigating investments which are held through direct ownership or through interests in common collective trusts return generating investments include primarily equity securities fixedincome securities and alternative investments eg private equity and hedge funds risk mitigating investments include primarily us government and investment grade corporate fixedincome securities the allocation of assets was as follows at december 31 2017 

 

 pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases lowering the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets by 50 basis points from 73 to 68 would increase estimated 2018 pension expense by approximately 20 million future pension obligations for united’s plans were discounted using a weighted average rate of 365 at december 31 2017 the company selected the discount rate for substantially all of its plans by using a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds at december 31 2017 that would provide the necessary cash flows to match the projected benefit payments the pension liability and future pension expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points from 365 to 315 would increase the pension liability at december 31 2017 by approximately 651 million and increase the estimated 2018 pension expense by approximately 80 million future changes in plan asset returns plan provisions assumed discount rates pension funding law and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future 

actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions under the applicable accounting standards for defined benefit pension plans those gains and losses are not required to be recognized currently as pension benefit expense but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into expense over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees all gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are amortized to expense over the remaining years of service of the covered active employees at december 31 2017 and 2016 the company had unrecognized actuarial losses for pension benefit plans of 16 billion and 15 billion respectively recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 

other postretirement benefit plan accounting united’s postretirement plan provides certain health care benefits primarily in the united states to retirees and eligible dependents as well as certain life insurance benefits to certain retirees reflected as “other benefits” united also has retiree medical programs that permit retirees who meet certain age and service requirements to continue medical coverage between retirement and 

 

medicare eligibility eligible employees are required to pay a portion of the costs of their retiree medical benefits which in some cases may be offset by accumulated unused sick time at the time of their retirement plan benefits are subject to copayments deductibles and other limits as described in the plans 

the company accounts for other postretirement benefits by recognizing the difference between plan assets and obligations or the plan’s funded status in its financial statements other postretirement benefit expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees’ approximate service periods and is generally calculated independently of funding decisions or requirements united has not been required to prefund its plan obligations which has resulted in a significant net obligation as discussed below the company’s benefit obligation was 17 billion for the other postretirement benefit plans at december 31 2017 and 2016 

the calculation of other postretirement benefit expense and obligations requires the use of a number of assumptions including the assumed discount rate for measuring future payment obligations and the health care cost trend rate the company determines the appropriate discount rate for each of the plans based on current rates on high quality corporate bonds that would generate the cash flow necessary to pay plan benefits when due the company’s weighted average discount rate to determine its benefit obligations as of december 31 2017 was 363 as compared to 407 for december 31 2016 the health care cost trend rate assumed for 2017 was 650 declining to 50 in 2023 as compared to assumed trend rate for 2018 of 625 declining to 50 in 2023 a 1 increase in assumed health care trend rates would increase the company’s total service and interest cost for the year ended december 31 2017 by 11 million whereas a 1 decrease in assumed health care trend rates would decrease the company’s total service and interest cost for the year ended december 31 2017 by 8 million a one percentage point decrease in the weighted average discount rate would increase the company’s postretirement benefit liability by approximately 185 million and increase the estimated 2017 benefits expense by approximately 8 million 

actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions and prior service credits result from a retroactive reduction in benefits due under the plans under the applicable accounting standards for postretirement welfare benefit plans actuarial gains and losses and prior service credits are not required to be recognized currently but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into expense over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees or the average life expectancy of inactive participants at december 31 2017 and 2016 the company had unrecognized actuarial gains for postretirement welfare benefit plans of 301 million and 384 million respectively recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 

income taxes the tax act among other changes reduces the federal corporate income tax rate to 21 beginning in 2018 requires companies to pay a onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings as of december 31 2017 we had not completed our analysis of all aspects of the tax act however we have made a provisional estimate for its effect on our existing deferred tax balances and the onetime transition tax we remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future which is generally 21 we are still analyzing certain aspects of the tax act and refining our calculations which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend interest rates our net income is affected by fluctuations in interest rates eg interest expense on variable rate debt and interest income earned on shortterm investments the company’s policy is to manage interest rate risk through a combination of fixed and variable rate debt the following table summarizes information related to the company’s interest rate market risk at december 31 in millions 

 

  

a change in market interest rates would also impact interest income earned on our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments assuming our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments remain at their average 2017 levels a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a corresponding increase in the company’s interest income of approximately 45 million during 2018 

commodity price risk aircraft fuel the price level of aircraft fuel can significantly affect the company’s operations results of operations financial position and liquidity 

our operational and financial results can be significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel to provide adequate supplies of fuel the company routinely enters into purchase contracts that are customarily indexed to market prices for aircraft fuel and the company generally has some ability to cover shortterm fuel supply and infrastructure disruptions at some major demand locations the price of aircraft fuel has fluctuated substantially in the past several years and in order to lower its exposure to unpredictable increases in the market prices of aircraft fuel the company has historically hedged a portion of its planned fuel requirements the company’s current strategy is to not enter into transactions to hedge fuel price volatility although the company regularly reviews its policy based on market conditions and other factors the company’s 2018 forecasted fuel consumption is presently approximately four billion gallons and based on this forecast a one dollar change in the price of a barrel of crude oil would change the company’s annual fuel expense by approximately 96 million 

foreign currency the company generates revenues and incurs expenses in numerous foreign currencies changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the company’s results of operations through changes in the dollar value of foreign currencydenominated operating revenues and expenses some of the company’s more significant foreign currency exposures include the canadian dollar chinese renminbi european euro british pound and japanese yen the company’s current strategy is to not enter into transactions to hedge its foreign currency sales although the company regularly reviews its policy based on market conditions and other factors 

the result of a uniform 10 percent strengthening in the value of the us dollar from december 31 2017 levels relative to each of the currencies in which the company has foreign currency exposure would result in a decrease in pretax income of approximately 245 million for the year ending december 31 2018 this sensitivity analysis was prepared based upon projected 2018 foreign currencydenominated revenues and expenses as of december 31 2017

aircraft fuel the table below summarizes ual’s aircraft fuel consumption and expense during the last three years 

 

 our operational and financial results can be significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel to provide adequate supplies of fuel the company routinely enters into purchase contracts that are customarily indexed to market prices for aircraft fuel and the company generally has some ability to cover shortterm fuel supply and infrastructure disruptions at some major demand locations the price of aircraft fuel has fluctuated substantially in the past several years and in order to lower its exposure to unpredictable increases in the market prices of aircraft fuel the company has historically hedged a portion of its planned fuel requirements as of december 31 2016 the company did not have any outstanding fuel hedging contracts the company’s current strategy is to not enter into transactions to hedge its fuel consumption although the company regularly reviews its strategy based on market conditions and other factors 

thirdparty business united generates thirdparty business revenue that includes frequent flyer award nonair redemptions maintenance services catering and ground handling thirdparty business revenue is recorded in other operating revenue expenses associated with thirdparty business are recorded in other operating expenses 

distribution channels the company’s airline seat inventory and fares are distributed through the company’s direct channels traditional travel agencies and online travel agencies the use of the company’s direct sales website unitedcom the company’s mobile applications and alternative distribution systems provides the company with an opportunity to decommoditize its services better present its content make more targeted offerings better retain its customers enhance its brand and lower its ticket distribution costs agency sales are 

  

primarily sold using global distribution systems “gds” united has developed capabilities to sell certain ancillary products through the gds channel to provide an enhanced buying experience for customers who purchase in that channel to increase the company’s opportunities to sell its full range of products and services and lower distribution costs the company will continue to develop new selling capabilities in thirdparty channels and expand the capabilities of its website and mobile applications 

industry conditions 

domestic competition the domestic airline industry is highly competitive and dynamic the company’s competitors consist primarily of other airlines and to a certain extent other forms of transportation currently any us carrier deemed fit by the dot is free to operate scheduled passenger service between any two points within the united states competition can be direct in the form of another carrier flying the exact nonstop route or indirect where a carrier serves the same two cities nonstop from an alternative airport in that city or via an itinerary requiring a connection at another airport air carriers’ cost structures are not uniform and there are numerous factors influencing cost structure carriers with lower costs may offer lower fares to passengers which could have a potential negative impact on the company’s revenues decisions on domestic pricing are based on intense competitive pressure exerted on the company by other us airlines in order to remain competitive and maintain passenger traffic levels we often find it necessary to match competitors’ discounted fares since we compete in a dynamic marketplace attempts to generate additional revenue through increased fares oftentimes fail 

international competition internationally the company competes not only with us airlines but also with foreign carriers international competition has increased and may increase in the future as a result of airline mergers and acquisitions joint ventures alliances restructurings liberalization of aviation bilateral agreements and new or increased service by competitors including government subsidized competitors from certain middle east countries competition on international routes is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation the company’s ability to compete successfully with nonus carriers on international routes depends in part on its ability to generate traffic to and from the entire united states via its integrated domestic route network and its ability to overcome business and operational challenges across its network worldwide foreign carriers currently are prohibited by us law from carrying local passengers between two points in the united states and the company generally experiences comparable restrictions in foreign countries separately “fifth freedom rights” allow the company to operate between points in two different foreign countries and foreign carriers may also have fifth freedom rights between the us and another foreign country in the absence of fifth freedom rights or some other extrabilateral right to conduct operations between two foreign countries us carriers are constrained from carrying passengers to points beyond designated international gateway cities to compensate partially for these structural limitations us and foreign carriers have entered into alliances joint ventures and marketing arrangements that enable these carriers to exchange traffic between each other’s flights and route networks see alliances above for additional information 

seasonality the air travel business is subject to seasonal fluctuations historically demand for air travel is higher in the second and third quarters driving higher revenues than in the first and fourth quarters which are periods of lower travel demand 

industry regulation 

domestic regulation 

all carriers engaged in air transportation in the united states are subject to regulation by the dot absent an exemption no air carrier may provide air transportation of passengers or property without first being issued a dot certificate of public convenience and necessity the dot also grants international route authority approves international codeshare arrangements and regulates methods of competition the dot regulates consumer protection and maintains jurisdiction over advertising denied boarding compensation tarmac delays baggage liability and other areas and may add additional expensive regulatory burdens in the future the dot has 

  

launched investigations or claimed rulemaking authority to regulate commercial agreements among carriers or between carriers and third parties in a wide variety of contexts 

airlines are also regulated by the federal aviation administration the “faa” an agency within the dot primarily in the areas of flight safety air carrier operations and aircraft maintenance and airworthiness the faa issues air carrier operating certificates and aircraft airworthiness certificates prescribes maintenance procedures oversees airport operations and regulates pilot and other employee training from time to time the faa issues directives that require air carriers to inspect or modify aircraft and other equipment potentially causing the company to incur substantial unplanned expenses the airline industry is also subject to numerous other federal laws and regulations the us department of homeland security “dhs” has jurisdiction over virtually every aspect of civil aviation security the antitrust division of the us department of justice “doj” has jurisdiction over certain airline competition matters the us postal service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail by airlines labor relations in the airline industry are generally governed by the railway labor act “rla” a federal statute the company is also subject to investigation inquiries by the dot faa doj dhs and other us and international regulatory bodies 

airport access access to landing and takeoff rights or “slots” at several major us airports and many foreign airports served by the company are or recently have been subject to government regulation federally mandated domestic slot restrictions that limit operations and regulate capacity currently apply at reagan national airport in washington dc and at john f kennedy international airport and laguardia airport in the new york city metropolitan region additional restrictions on airline routes and takeoff and landing slots at these and other airports may be proposed in the future that could affect the company’s rights of ownership and transfer in april 2016 the faa announced that it was lifting slot controls at newark as of the winter 2016 season this change may result in additional congestion at newark and in the new york city metropolitan region airspace as a whole if slots are eliminated at an airport or if the number of hours of operation governed by slots is reduced at an airport the lack of controls on takeoffs and landings could result in greater congestion both at the affected airport or in the regional airspace eg the new york city metropolitan airspace and could significantly impact the company’s operations 

legislation  the airline industry is subject to legislative activity that may have an impact on operations and costs in 2017 the us congress will continue to consider legislation to reauthorize the faa which encompasses all significant aviation tax and policyrelated issues as with previous reauthorization legislation the us congress may consider a range of policy changes that could impact operations and costs finally aviation security continues to be the subject of legislative and regulatory action requiring changes to the company’s security processes potentially increasing the cost of its security procedures and affecting its operations 

international regulation 

international air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation in connection with the company’s international services the company is regulated by both the us government and the governments of the foreign countries the company serves in addition the availability of international routes to us carriers is regulated by aviation agreements between the us and foreign governments and in some cases fares and schedules require the approval of the dot andor the relevant foreign governments 

legislation foreign countries are increasingly enacting passenger protection laws rules and regulations that meet or exceed us requirements in cases where this activity exceeds us requirements additional burden and liability may be placed on the company certain countries have regulations requiring passenger compensation andor enforcement penalties from the company in addition to changes in operating procedures due to canceled and delayed flights 

airport access historically access to foreign markets has been tightly controlled through bilateral agreements between the us and each foreign country involved these agreements regulate the markets served the number of carriers allowed to serve each market and the frequency of carriers’ flights since the early 1990s the us has pursued a policy of “open skies” meaning all usflag carriers have access to the destination under which the 

  

us government has negotiated a number of bilateral agreements allowing unrestricted access between us and foreign markets currently there are more than 100 open skies agreements in effect however even with open skies many of the airports that the company serves in europe asia and latin america maintain slot controls a large number of these slot controls exist due to congestion environmental and noise protection and reduced capacity due to runway and air traffic control “atc” construction work among other reasons london heathrow international airport frankfurt rheinmain airport shanghai pudong international airport beijing capital international airport sao paulo guarulhos international airport and tokyo haneda international airport are among the most restrictive foreign airports due to slot and capacity limitations 

the company’s ability to serve some foreign markets and expand into certain others is limited by the absence of aviation agreements between the us government and the relevant foreign governments shifts in us or foreign government aviation policies may lead to the alteration or termination of air service agreements depending on the nature of any such change the value of the company’s international route authorities and slot rights may be materially enhanced or diminished 

environmental regulation 

the airline industry is subject to increasingly stringent federal state local and international environmental requirements including those regulating emissions to air water discharges safe drinking water and the use and management of hazardous substances and wastes 

climate change  there is an increasing global regulatory focus on greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions and their potential impacts relating to climate change in october 2013 the international civil aviation organization “icao” a united nations body agreed to develop a global market based measure to address carbon emissions from international aviation which was adopted in october 2016 the program the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation “corsia” is intended to create a single global marketbased measure to achieve carbonneutral growth for international aviation after 2020 which will be achieved through airline purchases of carbon offset credits certain corsia program details remain to be developed and the impact of corsia cannot be fully predicted but corsia is expected to increase operating costs for airlines that operate internationally in 2016 icao also adopted a carbon dioxide “co2” emission standard for aircraft and the us environmental protection agency has started the process required to adopt the standard while the precise timing and final form of these various programs and requirements continue to evolve the company is taking various actions that are expected to help to reduce its co2 emissions over time such as fleet renewal aircraft retrofits and the commercialization of aviation alternative fuels 

other regulations  our operations are subject to a variety of other environmental laws and regulations both in the united states and internationally these include noiserelated restrictions on aircraft types and operating times which have or could in the future result in curtailments in services increased operating costs or limits on expansion certain foreign airports andor governments either have or are seeking to establish environmental fees applicable to carbon emissions local air quality pollutants andor noise in the united states new regulations affecting underground storage tanks became effective in 2015 which are expected to affect certain airport fuel hydrant systems potentially impacting operating costs the implementation of revised national ambient air quality standards for ozone by individual affected states scheduled for early 2020 is expected to trigger restrictions on mobile sources such as cars trucks and airport ground support equipment in those jurisdictions where ozone levels exceed the new standards finally environmental cleanup laws can require the company to undertake or subject the company to liability for investigation and remediation costs at owned or leased locations or third party disposal locations 

until applicability of new regulations to our specific operations is better defined andor when new regulations are finalized future costs to comply with such regulations will remain uncertain but are likely to increase our operating costs over time while we continue to monitor these developments the precise nature of future requirements and their applicability to the company are difficult to predict but the financial impact to the company and the aviation industry could be significant 

  

employees 

as of december 31 2016 ual including its subsidiaries had approximately 88000 employees approximately 80 of the company’s employees were represented by various us labor organizations as of december 31 2016 

collective bargaining agreements between the company and its represented employee groups are negotiated under the rla such agreements typically do not contain an expiration date and instead specify an amendable date upon which the agreement is considered “open for amendment” in 2016 the company finalized new or extension agreements with all 11 of its us employee groups including joint collective bargaining agreements with its flight attendants and technicians and related employees 

the following table reflects the company’s represented employee groups the number of employees per represented group union representation for each of united’s employee groups and the amendable date for each employee group’s collective bargaining agreement as of december 31 2016

 item 1a risk factors tableend the following risk factors should be read carefully when evaluating the company’s business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this report and other statements the company or its representatives make from time to time any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect the company’s business operating results financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this report 

global economic political and industry conditions constantly change and unfavorable conditions may have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations 

the company’s business and results of operations are significantly impacted by global economic and industry conditions the airline industry is highly cyclical and the level of demand for air travel is correlated to the strength of the us and global economies the company is a global business with operations outside of the united states from which it derives significant operating revenues the company’s international operations are a vital part of its worldwide airline network volatile economic political and market conditions in these international regions may have a negative impact on the company’s operating results and its ability to achieve its business objectives 

robust demand for the company’s air transportation services depends largely on favorable economic conditions including the strength of the domestic and foreign economies low unemployment levels strong consumer confidence levels and the availability of consumer and business credit air transportation is often a discretionary purchase that leisure travelers may limit or eliminate during difficult economic times in addition during periods of unfavorable economic conditions business travelers usually reduce the volume of their travel either due to costsaving initiatives or as a result of decreased business activity requiring travel during such periods the company’s business and results of operations may be adversely affected due to significant declines in industry passenger demand particularly with respect to the company’s business and premium cabin travelers and a reduction in fare levels 

stagnant or weakening global economic conditions either in the united states or in other geographic regions and any future volatility in us and global financial and credit markets may have a material adverse effect on the company’s revenues results of operations and liquidity if such economic conditions were to disrupt capital markets in the future the company may be unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all to refinance certain maturing debt and to satisfy future capital commitments 

recently united kingdom “uk” voters voted for the uk to exit the european union the “eu” a nonbinding referendum that if passed into law could adversely affect european and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets including volatility in the value of the british pound and european euro additional travel restrictions on passengers traveling between the uk and other eu countries and legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations these adverse effects in european market conditions could negatively impact the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition significant or volatile changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies may have a material adverse impact upon the company’s liquidity revenues costs and operating results 

the airline industry is highly competitive and susceptible to price discounting and changes in capacity which could have a material adverse effect on the company 

the us airline industry is characterized by substantial price competition including from lowcost carriers the significant market presence of lowcost carriers which engage in substantial price discounting may diminish our ability to achieve sustained profitability on domestic and international routes 

airlines also compete for market share by increasing or decreasing their capacity including route systems and the number of markets served several of the company’s domestic and international competitors have increased 

  

their international capacity by including service to some destinations that the company currently serves causing overlap in destinations served and therefore increasing competition for those destinations this increased competition in both domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

terrorist attacks or international hostilities or the fear of terrorist attacks or hostilities even if not made directly on the airline industry could negatively affect the company and the airline industry 

the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 involving commercial aircraft severely and adversely impacted the company’s financial condition and results of operations as well as the prospects for the airline industry among the effects experienced from the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks were substantial flight disruption costs caused by the faaimposed temporary grounding of the us airline industry’s fleet significantly increased security costs and associated passenger inconvenience increased insurance costs substantially higher ticket refunds and significantly decreased traffic and passenger revenue 

additional terrorist attacks even if not made directly on the airline industry or the fear of or the precautions taken in anticipation of such attacks including elevated national threat warnings or selective cancellation or redirection of flights could materially and adversely affect the company and the airline industry wars and other international hostilities could also have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition liquidity and results of operations the company’s financial resources may not be sufficient to absorb the adverse effects of any future terrorist attacks or other international hostilities 

increasing privacy and data security obligations or a significant data breach may adversely affect the company’s business 

the company is subject to increasing legislative regulatory and customer focus on privacy issues and data security also a number of the company’s commercial partners including credit card companies have imposed data security standards that the company must meet and these standards continue to evolve the company will continue its efforts to meet its privacy and data security obligations however it is possible that certain new obligations may be difficult to meet and could increase the company’s costs additionally the company must manage evolving cybersecurity risks the loss disclosure misappropriation of or access to customers’ employees’ or business partners’ information or the company’s failure to meet its obligations could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties a significant data breach or the company’s failure to meet its obligations may adversely affect the company’s reputation business results of operations and financial condition 

the company relies heavily on technology and automated systems to operate its business and any significant failure or disruption of the technology or these systems could materially harm its business 

the company depends on automated systems and technology to operate its business including computerized airline reservation systems flight operations systems revenue management systems accounting systems telecommunication systems and commercial websites including wwwunitedcom united’s website and other automated systems must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic maintain secure information and deliver important flight and schedule information as well as process critical financial transactions these systems could suffer substantial or repeated disruptions due to various events some of which are beyond the company’s control including natural disasters power failures terrorist attacks equipment or software failures computer viruses or cyber security attacks substantial or repeated systems failures or disruptions including failures or disruptions related to the company’s complex integration of systems could reduce the attractiveness of the company’s services versus those of its competitors materially impair its ability to market its services and operate its flights result in the unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information result in increased costs lost revenue and the loss or compromise of important data and may adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

  

current or future litigation and regulatory actions or failure to comply with the terms of any settlement order or arrangement relating to these actions could have a material adverse impact on the company 

from time to time we are subject to litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings relating to our business or investigations or other actions by governmental agencies including as described in part i item 3 “legal proceedings” of this annual report on form 10k no assurances can be given that the results of these or new matters will be favorable to us an adverse resolution of lawsuits arbitrations investigations or other proceedings or actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations including as a result of nonmonetary remedies defending ourselves in these matters may be timeconsuming expensive and disruptive to normal business operations and may result in significant expense and a diversion of management’s time and attention from the operation of our business which could impede our ability to achieve our business objectives additionally any amount that we may be required to pay to satisfy a judgment settlement fine or penalty may not be covered by insurance if we fail to comply with the terms contained in any settlement order or agreement with a governmental authority relating to these matters we could be subject to criminal or civil penalties which could have a material adverse impact on the company under our charter and certain indemnification agreements that we have entered into and may in the future enter into with our officers directors and certain third parties we could be required to indemnify and advance expenses to them in connection with their involvement in certain actions suits investigations and other proceedings there can be no assurance that any of these payments will not be material 

disruptions to the company’s regional network and united express flights provided by thirdparty regional carriers could adversely affect the company’s operations and financial condition 

the company has contractual relationships with various regional carriers to provide regional jet and turboprop service branded as united express these regional operations are an extension of the company’s mainline network and complement the company’s operations by carrying traffic that connects to mainline service and allows flights to smaller cities that cannot be provided economically with mainline aircraft the company’s business and operations are dependent on its regional flight network with regional capacity accounting for approximately 11 of the company’s total capacity as of december 31 2016 

although the company has agreements with its regional carriers that include contractually agreed performance metrics the company does not control the operations of these carriers a number of factors may impact the company’s regional network including weatherrelated effects and seasonality in addition the decrease in qualified pilots driven by federal regulations has adversely impacted and could continue to affect the company’s regional flying for example the faa’s expansion of minimum pilot qualification standards including a requirement that a pilot have at least 1500 total flight hours as well as the faa’s revised pilot flight and duty time rules effective january 2014 have contributed to a smaller supply of pilots available to regional carriers the decrease in qualified pilots resulting from the regulations as well as factors including a decreased student pilot population and a shrinking us military from which to hire qualified pilots could adversely impact the company’s operations and financial condition and also require the company to reduce regional carrier flying 

if a significant disruption occurs to the company’s regional network or flights or if one or more of the regional carriers with which the company has relationships is unable to perform their obligations over an extended period of time there could be a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and operations 

the company’s business relies extensively on thirdparty service providers failure of these parties to perform as expected or interruptions in the company’s relationships with these providers or their provision of services to the company could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the company has engaged thirdparty service providers to perform a large number of functions that are integral to its business including regional operations operation of customer service call centers distribution and sale of airline seat inventory provision of information technology infrastructure and services transmitting or uploading of data provision of aircraft maintenance and repairs provision of various utilities and performance of aircraft 

  

fueling operations among other vital functions and services the company does not directly control these thirdparty service providers although it does enter into agreements with most of them that define expected service performance any of these thirdparty service providers however may materially fail to meet their service performance commitments to the company may suffer disruptions to their systems that could impact their services or the agreements with such providers may be terminated for example flight reservations booked by customers and travel agencies via thirdparty gdss may be adversely affected by disruptions in the business relationships between the company and gds operators such disruptions including a failure to agree upon acceptable contract terms when contracts expire or otherwise become subject to renegotiation may cause the company’s flight information to be limited or unavailable for display significantly increase fees for both the company and gds users and impair the company’s relationships with its customers and travel agencies the failure of any of the company’s thirdparty service providers to perform their service obligations adequately or other interruptions of services may reduce the company’s revenues and increase its expenses prevent the company from operating its flights and providing other services to its customers or result in adverse publicity or harm to its brand in addition the company’s business and financial performance could be materially harmed if its customers believe that its services are unreliable or unsatisfactory 

orders for new aircraft typically must be placed years in advance of scheduled deliveries and changes in the company’s route network over time may make aircraft on order less economic for the company but any modification or termination of such orders could result in material liability for the company 

the company’s orders for new aircraft are typically made years in advance of actual delivery of such aircraft and the financial commitment required for purchases of new aircraft is substantial at december 31 2016 the company had firm commitments to purchase 257 new aircraft from the boeing company “boeing” airbus sas “airbus” and embraer sa “embraer” as well as related agreements with engine manufacturers maintenance providers and others at december 31 2016 the company’s commitments relating to the acquisition of aircraft and related spare engines aircraft improvements and other related obligations aggregated 236 billion 

subsequent to the company placing an order for new aircraft the company’s route network may change such that the aircraft on order become less economic to operate flights in the company’s network as a result the company’s preference for a particular aircraft that it has ordered often years in advance may be decreased or eliminated if the company were to seek to modify or terminate its existing aircraft order commitments it may be responsible for material obligations to its counterparties arising from any such change however the company expects that any such change that it makes would be in the longterm best economic interest of the company 

the company could experience adverse publicity harm to its brand reduced travel demand and potential tort liability as a result of an accident catastrophe or incident involving its aircraft the aircraft of its regional carriers or the aircraft of its codeshare partners which may result in a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial position 

an accident catastrophe or incident involving an aircraft that the company operates or an aircraft that is operated by a codeshare partner or one of the company’s regional carriers could have a material adverse effect on the company if such accident catastrophe or incident created a public perception that the company’s operations or the operations of its codeshare partners or regional carriers are not safe or reliable or are less safe or reliable than other airlines such public perception could in turn result in adverse publicity for the company cause harm to the company’s brand and reduce travel demand on the company’s flights or the flights of its codeshare partners or regional carriers 

in addition any such accident catastrophe or incident could expose the company to significant tort liability although the company currently maintains liability insurance in amounts and of the type the company believes to be consistent with industry practice to cover damages arising from any such accident or catastrophe and the company’s codeshare partners and regional carriers carry similar insurance and generally indemnify the 

  

company for their operations if the company’s liability exceeds the applicable policy limits or the ability of another carrier to indemnify it the company could incur substantial losses from an accident catastrophe or incident which may result in a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial position 

if we experience changes in or are unable to retain our senior management team or other key employees our operating results could be adversely affected 

much of our future success depends on the continued availability of skilled personnel with industry experience and knowledge including our senior management team and other key employees if we are unable to attract and retain talented highly qualified senior management and other key employees or if we are unable to effectively provide for the succession of senior management our business may be adversely affected 

high andor volatile fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a material adverse impact on the company’s strategic plans operating results financial position and liquidity 

aircraft fuel is critical to the company’s operations and is one of its single largest operating expenses the timely and adequate supply of fuel to meet operational demand depends on the continued availability of reliable fuel supply sources as well as related service and delivery infrastructure although the company has some ability to cover shortterm fuel supply and infrastructure disruptions at some major demand locations it can neither predict nor guarantee the continued timely availability of aircraft fuel throughout the company’s system the company generally sources fuel at prevailing market prices 

aircraft fuel has historically been the company’s most volatile operating expense due to the highly unpredictable nature of market prices for fuel market prices for aircraft fuel have historically fluctuated substantially in short periods of time and continue to be highly volatile due a dependence on a multitude of unpredictable factors beyond the company’s control these factors include changes in global crude oil prices the balance between aircraft fuel supply and demand natural disasters prevailing inventory levels and fuel production and transportation infrastructure prices of fuel are also impacted by indirect factors that may potentially impact fuel supply or demand balance such as geopolitical events economic growth indicators fiscalmonetary policies fuel tax policies environmental concerns and financial investments in energy markets both actual changes in these factors as well as changes in market expectations of these factors can potentially drive rapid changes in fuel price levels in short periods of time 

given the highly competitive nature of the airline industry the company may not be able to increase its fares and fees sufficiently to offset the full impact of increases in fuel prices especially if these increases are significant rapid and sustained further such fare and fee increases may not be sustainable may reduce the general demand for air travel and may also eventually impact the company’s strategic growth and investment plans for the future in addition decreases in fuel prices for an extended period of time may result in increased industry capacity increased competitive actions for market share and lower fares or surcharges in general if fuel prices were to then subsequently rise quickly there may be a lag between the rise in fuel prices and any improvement of the revenue environment 

to protect against increases in the market prices of fuel the company may hedge a portion of its future fuel requirements however the company’s hedging program may not be successful in mitigating higher fuel costs and any price protection provided may be limited due to choice of hedging instruments and market conditions including breakdown of correlation between hedging instrument and market price of aircraft fuel and failure of hedge counterparties to the extent that the company decides to hedge a portion of its future fuel requirements and uses hedge contracts that have the potential to create an obligation to pay upon settlement if fuel prices decline significantly such hedge contracts may limit the company’s ability to benefit fully from lower fuel costs in the future if fuel prices decline significantly from the levels existing at the time the company enters into a hedge contract the company may be required to post collateral margin beyond certain thresholds there can be no assurance that the company’s hedging arrangements will provide any particular level of protection against 

  

rises in fuel prices or that its counterparties will be able to perform under the company’s hedging arrangements additionally deterioration in the company’s financial condition could negatively affect its ability to enter into new hedge contracts in the future 

see note 10 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information on the company’s hedging activities 

union disputes employee strikes or slowdowns and other laborrelated disruptions could adversely affect the company’s operations and could result in increased costs that impair its financial performance 

united is a highly unionized company as of december 31 2016 the company and its subsidiaries had approximately 88000 active employees of whom approximately 80 were represented by various us labor organizations 

there is a risk that unions or individual employees might pursue judicial or arbitral claims arising out of changes implemented as a result of the company entering into collective bargaining agreements with its represented employee groups there is also a possibility that employees or unions could engage in job actions such as slowdowns worktorule campaigns sickouts or other actions designed to disrupt the company’s normal operations in an attempt to pressure the company in collective bargaining negotiations although the rla makes such actions unlawful until the parties have been lawfully released to selfhelp and the company can seek injunctive relief against premature selfhelp such actions can cause significant harm even if ultimately enjoined in addition collective bargaining agreements with the company’s represented employee groups increase the company’s labor costs which increase could be material for any applicable reporting period 

see notes 15 and 16 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information on labor negotiations and costs 

an outbreak of a disease or similar public health threat could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business financial position and results of operations 

an outbreak of a disease or similar public health threat that affects travel demand or travel behavior or travel restrictions or reduction in the demand for air travel caused by an outbreak of a disease or similar public health threat in the future could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

extensive government regulation could increase the company’s operating costs and restrict its ability to conduct its business 

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal oversight compliance with us and international regulations imposes significant costs and may have adverse effects on the company laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges both domestically and internationally have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce airline revenue 

united provides air transportation under certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by the dot if the dot altered amended modified suspended or revoked these certificates it could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business the faa regulates the safety of united’s operations united operates pursuant to an air carrier operating certificate issued by the faa in january 2014 the faa’s more stringent pilot flight and duty time requirements under part 117 of the federal aviation regulations took effect which has increased costs for all carriers in july 2014 minimum qualifications took effect for air carrier first officers these regulations will continue to impact the industry and the company for years to come as they have caused mainline airlines to hire regional pilots while simultaneously significantly reducing the pool of new pilots from which regional carriers themselves can hire although this is an industry issue it directly affects the company and requires it to reduce regional partner flying as several regional partners have experienced difficulty flying their schedules due to reduced pilot availability from time to time the faa also issues orders airworthiness 

  

directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require material expenditures or operational restrictions by the company these faa orders and directives could include the temporary grounding of an entire aircraft type if the faa identifies design manufacturing maintenance or other issues requiring immediate corrective action these faa directives or requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company 

in addition the company’s operations may be adversely impacted due to the existing antiquated atc system utilized by the us government during peak travel periods in certain markets the current atc system’s inability to handle atc demand has led to shortterm capacity constraints imposed by government agencies and resulted in delays and disruptions of air traffic in addition the current system will not be able to effectively handle projected future air traffic growth imposition of these atc constraints on a longterm basis may have a material adverse effect on the company’s operations failure to update the atc system in a timely manner and the substantial funding requirements of a modernized atc system that may be imposed on air carriers may have an adverse impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

access to landing and takeoff rights or “slots” at several major us airports and many foreign airports served by the company are or recently have been subject to government regulation certain of the company’s major hubs are among the most congested airports in the united states and have been or could be the subject of regulatory action that might limit the number of flights andor increase costs of operations at certain times or throughout the day the faa may limit the company’s airport access by limiting the number of departure and arrival slots at high density traffic airports which could affect the company’s ownership and transfer rights and local airport authorities may have the ability to control access to certain facilities or the cost of access to their facilities which could have an adverse effect on the company’s business the faa historically has taken actions with respect to airlines’ slot holdings that airlines have challenged if the faa were to take actions that adversely affect the company’s slot holdings the company could incur substantial costs to preserve its slots or may lose slots if slots are eliminated at an airport or if the number of hours of operation governed by slots is reduced at an airport the lack of controls on takeoffs and landings could result in greater congestion both at the affected airport or in the regional airspace eg the new york city metropolitan region airspace and could significantly impact the company’s operations further the company’s operating costs at airports including the company’s major hubs may increase significantly because of capital improvements at such airports that the company may be required to fund directly or indirectly such costs could be imposed by the relevant airport authority without the company’s approval and may have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition 

the ability of carriers to operate flights on international routes between the united states and other countries may be subject to change applicable arrangements between the united states and foreign governments may be amended from time to time government policies with respect to airport operations may be revised and the availability of appropriate slots or facilities may change the company currently operates a number of flights on international routes under government arrangements regulations or policies that designate the number of carriers permitted to operate on such routes the capacity of the carriers providing services on such routes the airports at which carriers may operate international flights or the number of carriers allowed access to particular airports any further limitations additions or modifications to such arrangements regulations or policies could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations additionally a change in law regulation or policy for any of the company’s international routes such as open skies could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial position and results of operations and could result in the impairment of material amounts of related tangible and intangible assets in addition competition from revenuesharing joint ventures and other alliance arrangements by and among other airlines could impair the value of the company’s business and assets on the open skies routes the company’s plans to enter into or expand us antitrust immunized alliances and joint ventures on various international routes are subject to receipt of approvals from applicable us federal authorities and obtaining other applicable foreign government clearances or satisfying the necessary applicable regulatory requirements there can be no assurance that such approvals and clearances will be granted or will continue in effect upon further regulatory review or that changes in regulatory requirements or standards can be satisfied 

  

many aspects of the company’s operations are also subject to increasingly stringent federal state local and international laws protecting the environment future environmental regulatory developments such as climate change regulations in the united states and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in the airline industry in addition there is the potential for additional regulatory actions in regard to the emission of ghgs by the aviation industry the precise nature of future requirements and their applicability to the company are difficult to predict but the financial impact to the company and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant 

in 2017 the us congress will continue to consider legislation to reauthorize the faa which encompasses all significant aviation tax and policy related issues as with previous reauthorization legislation the us congress may consider a range of policy changes that could impact the company’s operations and costs 

see part i item 1 business—industry regulation of this report for additional information on government regulation impacting the company 

the airline industry may undergo further change with respect to alliances and joint ventures or due to consolidations any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company 

the company faces and may continue to face strong competition from other carriers due to the modification of alliances and formation of new joint ventures carriers may improve their competitive positions through airline alliances slot swaps andor joint ventures certain types of airline joint ventures further competition by allowing multiple airlines to coordinate routes pool revenues and costs and enjoy other mutual benefits achieving many of the benefits of consolidation “open skies” agreements including the agreements between the united states and the eu and between the united states and japan may also give rise to better integration opportunities among international carriers movement of airlines between current global airline alliances could reduce joint network coverage for members of such alliances while also creating opportunities for joint ventures and bilateral alliances that did not exist before such realignment there is ongoing speculation that further airline and airline alliance consolidations or reorganizations could occur in the future especially if new “open skies” agreements between brazil and the united states are fully implemented the company routinely engages in analysis and discussions regarding its own strategic position including current and potential alliances asset acquisitions and divestitures and may have future discussions with other airlines regarding strategic activities if other airlines participate in such activities those airlines may significantly improve their cost structures or revenue generation capabilities thereby potentially making them stronger competitors of the company and potentially impairing the company’s ability to realize expected benefits from its own strategic relationships 

insufficient liquidity may have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position and business 

the company has a significant amount of financial leverage from fixed obligations including aircraft lease and debt financings leases of airport property and other facilities and other material cash obligations in addition the company has substantial noncancelable commitments for capital expenditures including for the acquisition of new aircraft and related spare engines 

although the company’s cash flows from operations and its available capital including the proceeds from financing transactions have been sufficient to meet these obligations and commitments to date the company’s future liquidity could be negatively affected by the risk factors discussed in this item 1a including but not limited to substantial volatility in the price of fuel adverse economic conditions disruptions in the global capital markets and catastrophic external events 

if the company’s liquidity is materially diminished due to the various risk factors noted in this item 1a or otherwise the company might not be able to timely pay its leases and debts or comply with certain operating and financial covenants under its financing and credit card processing agreements or with other material provisions of its contractual obligations certain of these covenants require the company or united as applicable to maintain minimum liquidity andor minimum collateral coverage ratios the company’s or united’s ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond its control including the overall industry revenue environment the level of fuel costs and the appraised value of the collateral 

  

if the company does not timely pay its leases and debts or comply with such covenants a variety of adverse consequences could result these potential adverse consequences include an increase of required reserves under credit card processing agreements withholding of credit card sale proceeds by its credit card service providers loss of undrawn lines of credit the occurrence of one or more events of default under the relevant agreements the acceleration of the maturity of debt andor the exercise of other remedies by its creditors and equipment lessors that could result in a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations the company cannot provide assurance that it would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance such debt if it were accelerated in addition an event of default or acceleration of debt under certain of its financing agreements could result in one or more events of default under certain of the company’s other financing agreements due to cross default and cross acceleration provisions 

furthermore insufficient liquidity may limit the company’s ability to withstand competitive pressures and downturns in the travel business and the economy in general 

the company’s substantial level of indebtedness and noninvestment grade credit rating as well as market conditions and the availability of assets as collateral for loans or other indebtedness may make it difficult for the company to raise additional capital if needed to meet its liquidity needs on acceptable terms or at all 

see part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report for additional information regarding the company’s liquidity 

increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage may materially and adversely impact the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

the company could be exposed to significant liability or loss if its property or operations were to be affected by a natural catastrophe or other event including aircraft accidents if the company is unable to obtain sufficient insurance including but not limited to terrorism aviation hull and liability workers’ compensation and property and business interruption insurance with acceptable terms or if the coverage obtained is insufficient relative to actual liability or losses that the company experiences whether due to insurance market conditions or otherwise its results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

the company’s results of operations fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors associated with the airline industry 

due to greater demand for air travel during the spring and summer months revenues in the airline industry in the second and third quarters of the year are generally stronger than revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year which are periods of lower travel demand the company’s results of operations generally reflect this seasonality but have also been impacted by numerous other factors that are not necessarily seasonal including among others the imposition of excise and similar taxes extreme or severe weather atc congestion geological events natural disasters changes in the competitive environment due to industry consolidation general economic conditions and other factors as a result the company’s quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year and historical operating results in a quarterly or annual period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 

the company may never realize the full value of its intangible assets or its longlived assets causing it to record impairments that may negatively affect its financial position and results of operations 

in accordance with applicable accounting standards the company is required to test its indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred in addition the company is required to test certain of its other assets for impairment if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred 

the company may be required to recognize impairments in the future due to among other factors extreme fuel price volatility tight credit markets a decline in the fair value of certain tangible or intangible assets 

  

unfavorable trends in historical or forecasted results of operations and cash flows and an uncertain economic environment as well as other uncertainties the company can provide no assurance that a material impairment charge of tangible or intangible assets will not occur in a future period the value of the company’s aircraft could be impacted in future periods by changes in supply and demand for these aircraft such changes in supply and demand for certain aircraft types could result from grounding of aircraft by the company or other carriers an impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the company’s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for us federal income tax purposes may be significantly limited due to various circumstances including certain possible future transactions involving the sale or issuance of ual common stock or if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels 

as of december 31 2016 ual reported consolidated federal net operating loss “nol” carryforwards of approximately 44 billion 

the company’s ability to use its nol carryforwards may be limited if it experiences an “ownership change” as defined in section 382 “section 382” of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended an ownership change generally occurs if certain stockholders increase their aggregate percentage ownership of a corporation’s stock by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest percentage ownership at any time during the testing period which is generally the threeyear period preceding any potential ownership change 

there is no assurance that the company will not experience a future ownership change under section 382 that may significantly limit or possibly eliminate its ability to use its nol carryforwards potential future transactions involving the sale or issuance of ual common stock including the exercise of conversion options under the terms of any convertible debt that ual may issue in the future the repurchase of such debt with ual common stock any issuance of ual common stock for cash and the acquisition or disposition of such stock by a stockholder owning 5 or more of ual common stock or a combination of such transactions may increase the possibility that the company will experience a future ownership change under section 382 

under section 382 a future ownership change would subject the company to additional annual limitations that apply to the amount of preownership change nols that may be used to offset postownership change taxable income this limitation is generally determined by multiplying the value of a corporation’s stock immediately before the ownership change by the applicable longterm taxexempt rate any unused annual limitation may subject to certain limits be carried over to later years and the limitation may under certain circumstances be increased by builtin gains in the assets held by such corporation at the time of the ownership change this limitation could cause the company’s us federal income taxes to be greater or to be paid earlier than they otherwise would be and could cause all or a portion of the company’s nol carryforwards to expire unused similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes the company’s ability to use its nol carryforwards will also depend on the amount of taxable income it generates in future periods its nol carryforwards may expire before the company can generate sufficient taxable income to use them in full 

our significant investments in airlines in other parts of the world and the commercial relationships that we have with those carriers may not produce the returns or results we expect 

an important part of our strategy to expand our global network includes making significant investments in airlines in other parts of the world and expanding our commercial relationships with these carriers in 2015 we made a 100 million investment in azul linhas aéreas brasileiras sa “azul” and enhanced our commercial arrangements with azul we expect to continue exploring similar noncontrolling investments in and entering into joint ventures commercial agreements loan transactions and strategic alliances with other carriers as part of our global business strategy these transactions and relationships including our strategic partnership with and investment in azul involve significant challenges and risks including that we may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment that we may not receive repayment of invested funds that they may distract 

  

management from our operations or that they may not generate the expected revenue synergies these events could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition 

in addition we are dependent on these other carriers for significant aspects of our network in the regions in which they operate while we work closely with these carriers we do not have control over their operations or business methods we may be subject to consequences from any improper behavior of joint venture partners including for failure to comply with anticorruption laws such as the united states foreign corrupt practices act furthermore our relationships with these carriers may be subject to the laws and regulations of nonus jurisdictions in which these carriers are located or conduct business any political or regulatory change in these jurisdictions that negatively impact or prohibit our arrangements with these carriers could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition to the extent that the operations of any of these carriers are disrupted over an extended period of time or their actions subject us to the consequences of failure to comply with laws and regulations our results of operations may be adversely affected

economic conditions the economic outlook for the aviation industry in 2017 is characterized by moderate us and global economic growth in such conditions we expect a moderate increase in the demand for air travel continuing economic uncertainty along with the strengthening us dollar is providing uncertainty in key asian south american and european markets and continued political and socioeconomic tensions may result in diminished demand for air travel 

capacity in 2017 the company expects consolidated asms to grow between 1 and 2 yearoveryear 

fuel the company’s average aircraft fuel price per gallon including related taxes was 149 in 2016 as compared to 194 in 2015 since 2014 the price of jet fuel has declined and remains volatile based on projected fuel consumption in 2017 a one dollar change in the price of a barrel of crude oil would change the company’s annual fuel expense by approximately 95 million 

labor as of december 31 2016 united had approximately 80 of employees represented by unions in 2016 united reached contract extensions with its pilots and dispatchers amended collective bargaining agreements with its iam represented employees reached a fiveyear contract with the afa covering all of its flight attendants and reached a sixyear contract with the ibt covering its technicians and related employees additionally the company will be increasing pay for its pilots in order to align with a recently implemented contract of another airline the costs associated with all these agreements is expected to add approximately 900 million of costs for fullyear 2017 the company cannot predict the outcome of future negotiations with its unionized employee groups increases in the pay and benefits resulting from new collective bargaining agreements could have a material financial impact on the company

other liquidity matters 

below is a summary of additional liquidity matters see the indicated notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional details related to these and other matters affecting our liquidity and commitments 

 

 contractual obligations the company’s business is capital intensive requiring significant amounts of capital to fund the acquisition of assets particularly aircraft in the past the company has funded the acquisition of aircraft through outright purchase by issuing debt by entering into capital or operating leases or through vendor financings the company also often enters into longterm lease commitments with airports to ensure access to terminal cargo maintenance and other required facilities 

the table below provides a summary of the company’s material contractual obligations as of december 31 2016 in billions 

 

     

    offbalance sheet arrangements an offbalance sheet arrangement is any transaction agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has 1 made guarantees 2 a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets 3 an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or 4 any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support or that engages in leasing hedging or research and development arrangements the company’s primary offbalance sheet arrangements include operating leases which are summarized in the contractual obligations table in contractual obligations above and certain municipal bond obligations as discussed below 

as of december 31 2016 united had cash collateralized 72 million of letters of credit united also had 383 million of surety bonds securing various obligations at december 31 2016 most of the letters of credit have evergreen clauses and are expected to be renewed on an annual basis and the surety bonds have expiration dates through 2021 

as of december 31 2016 united is the guarantor of approximately 19 billion in aggregate principal amount of taxexempt special facilities revenue bonds and interest thereon these bonds issued by various airport municipalities are payable solely from rentals paid under longterm agreements with the respective governing bodies the leasing arrangements associated with a majority of these obligations are accounted for as operating leases the leasing arrangements associated with a portion of these obligations are accounted for as capital leases the annual lease payments for those obligations accounted for as operating leases are included in the operating lease payments in the contractual obligations table above 

as of december 31 2016 united is the guarantor of 168 million of aircraft mortgage debt issued by one of united’s regional carriers the aircraft mortgage debt is subject to increased cost provisions and the company would potentially be responsible for those costs under the guarantees the increased cost provisions in the 168 million of aircraft mortgage debt are similar to those in certain of the company’s debt agreements see note 15 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information on increased cost provisions related to the company’s debt 

eetcs in june 2016 and september 2016 united completed two separate eetc offerings for a total principal amount of 20 billion united has received and recorded 708 million of the proceeds from these offerings as debt as of december 31 2016 see notes 11 and 14 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information on eetc passthrough trusts and variable interest entity consideration 

increased cost provisions see note 15 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information on increased cost provisions related to the company’s debt 

fuel consortia united participates in numerous fuel consortia with other air carriers at major airports to reduce the costs of fuel distribution and storage interline agreements govern the rights and responsibilities of the consortia members and provide for the allocation of the overall costs to operate the consortia based on usage the consortia and in limited cases the participating carriers have entered into longterm agreements to lease certain airport fuel storage and distribution facilities that are typically financed through taxexempt bonds either special facilities lease revenue bonds or general airport revenue bonds issued by various local municipalities in general each consortium lease agreement requires the consortium to make lease payments in amounts sufficient 

  

to pay the maturing principal and interest payments on the bonds as of december 31 2016 approximately 15 billion principal amount of such bonds were secured by significant fuel facility leases in which united participates as to which united and each of the signatory airlines has provided indirect guarantees of the debt as of december 31 2016 the company’s contingent exposure was approximately 234 million principal amount of such bonds based on its recent consortia participation the company’s contingent exposure could increase if the participation of other air carriers decreases the guarantees will expire when the taxexempt bonds are paid in full which ranges from 2017 to 2049 the company did not record a liability at the time these indirect guarantees were made see note 15 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information related to the company’s fuel consortia 

critical accounting policies 

critical accounting policies are defined as those that are affected by significant judgments and uncertainties which potentially could result in materially different accounting under different assumptions and conditions the company has prepared the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions the company has identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of the financial statements 

revenue recognition the company records passenger ticket sales and tickets sold by other airlines for use on united as passenger revenue when the transportation is provided or upon estimated breakage the value of unused passenger tickets is included in current liabilities as advance ticket sales tickets sold by other airlines are recorded at the estimated values to be billed to the other airlines differences between amounts billed and the actual amounts may be rejected and rebilled or written off if the amount recorded was different from the original estimate when necessary the company records a reserve against its interline billings and payables if historical experience indicates that these amounts are different nonrefundable tickets generally expire on the date of the intended flight unless the date is extended by notification from the customer on or before the intended flight date 

fees charged in association with changes or extensions to nonrefundable tickets are recorded as other revenue at the time the fee is incurred the fare on the changed ticket including any additional collection of fare is deferred and recognized in accordance with our transportation revenue recognition policy at the time the transportation is provided change fees related to nonrefundable tickets are considered a separate transaction from the air transportation because they represent a charge for the company’s additional service to modify a previous sale therefore the pricing of the change fee and the initial customer order are separately determined and represent distinct earnings processes 

the company records an estimate of breakage revenue on the flight date for tickets that will expire unused these estimates are based on the evaluation of actual historical results and forecasted trends refundable tickets expire after one year from the date of issuance 

the financial accounting standards board “fasb” amended the fasb accounting standards codification and created a new topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers  this amendment prescribes that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the amendment supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in topic 605 revenue recognition and most industryspecific guidance throughout the industry topics of the accounting standards codification the company currently plans to use the fullretrospective approach in adopting this standard on january 1 2018 under the new standard certain airline ancillary fees directly related to passenger revenue tickets such as ticket change fees and baggage fees are likely to no longer be considered distinct performance obligations separate from the passenger travel component in addition the ticket change fees which were previously recognized when received and booking fees when paid will likely be recognized when transportation is provided the company 

  

has previously recorded ancillary fees and change fees in other operating revenue but will record these in passenger revenue under the new standard the company is evaluating other possible impacts from the new standard on its consolidated financial statements 

frequent flyer accounting the company’s mileageplus program is designed to increase customer loyalty program participants earn miles by flying on united and certain other participating airlines program participants can also earn miles through purchases from other nonairline partners that participate in the company’s loyalty program we sell miles to these partners which include credit card issuers retail merchants hotels car rental companies and our participating airline partners miles can be redeemed for free other than taxes and government imposed fees discounted or upgraded air travel and nontravel awards the company records its obligation for future award redemptions using a deferred revenue model 

when frequent flyers earn miles for flights the company recognizes a portion of the ticket sales as revenue when the air transportation occurs and defers a portion of the ticket sale representing the value of the related miles as a multipledeliverable revenue arrangement the company determines the estimated selling price of air transportation and miles as if each element is sold on a separate basis the total consideration from each ticket sale is then allocated to each of these elements individually on a pro rata basis the miles are recorded in frequent flyer deferred revenue on the company’s consolidated balance sheet and recognized into revenue when the transportation is provided 

the company’s estimated selling price of miles is based on an equivalent ticket value less fulfillment discount which incorporates the expected redemption of miles as the best estimate of selling price for these miles the equivalent ticket value is based on the prior 12 months’ weighted average equivalent ticket value of similar fares as those used to settle award redemptions while taking into consideration such factors as redemption pattern cabin class loyalty status and geographic region the estimated selling price of miles is adjusted by a fulfillment discount that considers a number of factors including redemption patterns of various customer groups 

united has a significant contract to sell mileageplus miles to its cobranded credit card partner chase united identified the following significant revenue elements in its second amended and restated cobranded card marketing services agreement the “cobrand agreement” the air transportation element represented by the value of the mile generally resulting from its redemption for future air transportation and whose fair value is described above use of the united brand and access to mileageplus member lists advertising and other travel related benefits 

the fair value of the elements is determined using management’s estimated selling price of each element the objective of using the estimated selling price based methodology is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis accordingly we determine our best estimate of selling price by considering multiple inputs and methods including but not limited to discounted cash flows brand value volume discounts published selling prices number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed the company estimated the selling prices and volumes over the term of the cobrand agreement in order to determine the allocation of proceeds to each of the multiple elements to be delivered we also evaluate volumes on an annual basis which may result in a change in the allocation of estimated selling price on a prospective basis 

the company records passenger revenue related to the air transportation element when the transportation is delivered the other elements are generally recognized as other operating revenue when earned 

the company accounts for miles sold and awarded that will never be redeemed by program members which we refer to as breakage the company reviews its breakage estimates annually based upon the latest available information regarding redemption and expiration patterns miles expire after 18 months of member account inactivity the company’s estimate of the expected expiration of miles requires significant management judgment current and future changes to expiration assumptions or to the expiration policy or to program rules and program redemption opportunities may result in material changes to the deferred revenue balance as well as recognized revenues from the programs 

  

the following table summarizes information related to the company’s frequent flyer deferred revenue liability 

 

 longlived assets the net book value of operating property and equipment for the company was 23 billion and 22 billion at december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively the assets’ recorded value is impacted by a number of accounting policy elections including the estimation of useful lives and residual values and when necessary the recognition of asset impairment charges 

the company records assets acquired including aircraft at acquisition cost depreciable life is determined through economic analysis such as reviewing existing fleet plans obtaining appraisals and comparing estimated lives to other airlines that operate similar fleets as aircraft technology has improved useful life has increased and the company has generally estimated the lives of those aircraft to be 30 years residual values are estimated based on historical experience with regard to the sale of both aircraft and spare parts and are established in conjunction with the estimated useful lives of the related fleets residual values are based on when the aircraft are acquired and typically reflect asset values that have not reached the end of their physical life both depreciable lives and residual values are revised periodically as facts and circumstances arise to recognize changes in the company’s fleet plan and other relevant information a oneyear increase in the average depreciable life of the company’s flight equipment would reduce annual depreciation expense on flight equipment by approximately 57 million 

the company evaluates the carrying value of longlived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist for purposes of this testing the company has generally identified the aircraft fleet type as the lowest level of identifiable cash flows for purposes of testing aircraft for impairment an impairment charge is recognized when the asset’s carrying value exceeds its net undiscounted future cash flows and its fair market value the amount of the charge is the difference between the asset’s carrying value and fair market value 

in 2016 the company determined that the faa’s action impaired the entire value of its newark slots because the slots no longer were the mechanism that governed takeoff and landing rights and the company recorded a special charge to write off the intangible asset see notes 16 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information 

defined benefit plan accounting we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees the most critical assumptions impacting our defined benefit pension plan obligations and expenses are the weighted average discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on the plan assets 

united’s pension plans’ underfunded status was 19 billion at december 31 2016 funding requirements for taxqualified defined benefit pension plans are determined by government regulations in 2017 we anticipate contributing at least 400 million to our pension plans the fair value of the plans’ assets was 34 billion at december 31 2016 

when calculating pension expense for 2017 the company assumed that its plans’ assets would generate a longterm rate of return of approximately 70 the expected longterm rate of return assumption was developed based on historical experience and input from the trustee managing the plans’ assets the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of assets which is based on a goal of earning the highest rate of return while maintaining risk at acceptable levels our projected longterm rate of return reflects the active management of our plans’ assets the plans strive to have assets sufficiently diversified so that adverse or unexpected results from one security class will not have an unduly detrimental impact on the entire portfolio plan fiduciaries regularly review actual asset allocation and the pension plans’ investments are periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 

  

the defined benefit pension plans’ assets consist of return generating investments and risk mitigating investments which are held through direct ownership or through interests in common collective trusts return generating investments include primarily equity securities fixedincome securities and alternative investments eg private equity and hedge funds risk mitigating investments include primarily us government and investment grade corporate fixedincome securities the allocation of assets was as follows at december 31 2016 

 

 pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases lowering the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets by 50 basis points from 70 to 65 would increase estimated 2017 pension expense by approximately 17 million future pension obligations for united’s plans were discounted using a weighted average rate of 418 at december 31 2016 the company selected the discount rate for substantially all of its plans by using a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds at december 31 2016 that would provide the necessary cash flows to match the projected benefit payments the pension liability and future pension expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points from 418 to 368 would increase the pension liability at december 31 2016 by approximately 575 million and increase the estimated 2017 pension expense by approximately 73 million future changes in plan asset returns plan provisions assumed discount rates pension funding law and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future 

actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions under the applicable accounting standards for defined benefit pension plans those gains and losses are not required to be recognized currently as pension benefit expense but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into expense over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees all gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are amortized to expense over the remaining years of service of the covered active employees at december 31 2016 and 2015 the company had unrecognized actuarial losses for pension benefit plans of 15 billion and 844 million respectively recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 

other postretirement benefit plan accounting united’s postretirement plan provides certain health care benefits primarily in the united states to retirees and eligible dependents as well as certain life insurance benefits to certain retirees reflected as “other benefits” united also has retiree medical programs that permit retirees who meet certain age and service requirements to continue medical coverage between retirement and medicare eligibility eligible employees are required to pay a portion of the costs of their retiree medical benefits which in some cases may be offset by accumulated unused sick time at the time of their retirement plan benefits are subject to copayments deductibles and other limits as described in the plans 

the company accounts for other postretirement benefits by recognizing the difference between plan assets and obligations or the plan’s funded status in its financial statements other postretirement benefit expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees’ approximate service periods and is generally calculated independently of funding decisions or requirements united has not been required to prefund its plan obligations which has resulted in a significant net obligation as discussed below the company’s benefit obligation was 17 billion and 20 billion for the other postretirement benefit plans at december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively 

  

the calculation of other postretirement benefit expense and obligations requires the use of a number of assumptions including the assumed discount rate for measuring future payment obligations and the health care cost trend rate the company determines the appropriate discount rate for each of the plans based on current rates on high quality corporate bonds that would generate the cash flow necessary to pay plan benefits when due the company’s weighted average discount rate to determine its benefit obligations as of december 31 2016 was 407 as compared to 449 for december 31 2015 the health care cost trend rate assumed for 2016 was 675 declining to 50 in 2023 as compared to assumed trend rate for 2017 of 650 declining to 50 in 2023 a 1 increase in assumed health care trend rates would increase the company’s total service and interest cost for the year ended december 31 2016 by 13 million whereas a 1 decrease in assumed health care trend rates would decrease the company’s total service and interest cost for the year ended december 31 2016 by 11 million a one percentage point decrease in the weighted average discount rate would increase the company’s postretirement benefit liability by approximately 181 million and increase the estimated 2016 benefits expense by approximately 11 million 

actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions and prior service credits result from a retroactive reduction in benefits due under the plans under the applicable accounting standards for postretirement welfare benefit plans actuarial gains and losses and prior service credits are not required to be recognized currently but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into expense over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees or the average life expectancy of inactive participants at december 31 2016 and 2015 the company had unrecognized actuarial gains for postretirement welfare benefit plans of 384 million and 236 million respectively recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 

income taxes the company has a net deferred tax asset totaling 655 million as of december 31 2016 including 16 billion of federal and state nol carryforwards and 108 million of alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards net of a 8 million valuation allowance which do not expire the federal nol carryforwards will expire beginning in 2026 if unused in addition the majority of tax benefits of the state net operating losses of 56 million net of a 36 million valuation allowance will expire over a five to 20year period at the end of 2016 the company maintained a valuation allowance of 68 million against certain state and local nols and credit carryforwards which will expire unused due to limited carryforward periods 

the company periodically assesses whether it is more likely than not that it will generate sufficient taxable income to realize its deferred income tax assets the company establishes valuation allowances if it is not likely it will realize its deferred income tax assets in making this determination the company considers all available positive and negative evidence and makes certain assumptions the company considers among other things projected future taxable income scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities the overall business environment the company’s historical financial results and tax planning strategies in evaluating the likelihood of utilizing the company’s net deferred income tax assets the significant factors that the company considers include 1 the company’s recent history and forecasted profitability 2 growth in the us and global economies and 3 future impact of taxable temporary differences during 2015 after considering all positive and negative evidence and the four sources of taxable income the company concluded that its deferred income tax assets were more likely than not to be realized therefore the company released almost all of its valuation allowance in 2015 resulting in a 31 billion benefit in its provision for income taxes

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend interest rates our net income loss is affected by fluctuations in interest rates eg interest expense on variable rate debt and interest income earned on shortterm investments the company’s policy is to manage interest rate risk through a combination of fixed and variable rate debt the following table summarizes information related to the company’s interest rate market risk at december 31 in millions 

 

 a change in market interest rates would also impact interest income earned on our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments assuming our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments remain at their average 

  

2016 levels a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a corresponding increase in the company’s interest income of approximately 47 million during 2017 

commodity price risk aircraft fuel the price level of aircraft fuel can significantly affect the company’s operations results of operations financial position and liquidity since 2014 the price of jet fuel has declined but remains volatile 

our operational and financial results can be significantly impacted by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel to provide adequate supplies of fuel the company routinely enters into purchase contracts that are customarily indexed to market prices for aircraft fuel and the company generally has some ability to cover shortterm fuel supply and infrastructure disruptions at some major demand locations the price of aircraft fuel has fluctuated substantially in the past several years and in order to lower its exposure to unpredictable increases in the market prices of aircraft fuel the company has historically hedged a portion of its planned fuel requirements as of december 31 2016 the company did not have any outstanding fuel hedging contracts the company’s current strategy is to not enter into transactions to hedge its fuel consumption although the company regularly reviews its policy based on market conditions and other factors the company’s 2017 forecasted fuel consumption is presently approximately four billion gallons and based on this forecast a one dollar change in the price of a barrel of crude oil would change the company’s annual fuel expense by approximately 95 million 

foreign currency the company generates revenues and incurs expenses in numerous foreign currencies changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the company’s results of operations through changes in the dollar value of foreign currencydenominated operating revenues and expenses some of the company’s more significant foreign currency exposures include the canadian dollar chinese renminbi european euro british pound and japanese yen the company’s current strategy is to not enter into transactions to hedge its foreign currency sales although the company regularly reviews its policy based on market conditions and other factors as of december 31 2016 the company did not have any foreign currency derivative contracts outstanding the last of the company’s foreign currency derivatives expired in december 2016 

the result of a uniform 10 percent strengthening in the value of the us dollar from december 31 2016 levels relative to each of the currencies in which the company has foreign currency exposure would result in a decrease in pretax income of approximately 239 million for the year ending december 31 2017 this sensitivity analysis was prepared based upon projected 2017 foreign currencydenominated revenues and expenses as of december 31 2016

regional the company has contractual relationships with various regional carriers to provide regional jet and turboprop service branded as united express these regional operations are an extension of the company’s mainline network this regional service complements our operations by carrying traffic that connects to our mainline service and allows flights to smaller cities that cannot be provided economically with mainline aircraft republic airlines “republic” commutair airlines “commutair” expressjet airlines “expressjet” gojet airlines “gojet” mesa airlines “mesa” shuttle america “shuttle” skywest airlines “skywest” and trans states airlines “trans states” are all regional carriers which operate most of their capacity contracted to united under capacity purchase agreements “cpas” with united under these cpas the company pays the regional carriers contractually agreed fees carriercontrolled costs for operating these flights plus a variable reimbursement incentive payment for operational performance based on agreed performance metrics the fees for carriercontrolled costs are based on specific rates for various operating expenses of the regional carriers such as crew expenses maintenance and aircraft ownership some of which are multiplied by specific operating statistics eg block hours departures while others are fixed monthly amounts under these cpas the company is responsible for all fuel costs incurred as well as landing fees facilities rent and other costs which are either passed through by the regional carrier to the company without any markup or directly incurred by the company in return the regional carriers operate this capacity exclusively for united on schedules determined by the company the company also determines pricing and revenue management assumes the inventory and distribution risk for the available seats and permits mileage accrual and redemption for regional flights through its mileageplus loyalty program 

while the regional carriers operating under cpas comprise more than 95 of all regional flights the company also has prorate agreements with hyannis air service inc “cape air” skywest and trans states under these commercial flying agreements the company and its regional carriers agree to divide revenue collected from each passenger according to a formula while both the company and its regional carriers are individually responsible for their own costs of operations unlike cpas under a prorate agreement the regional carrier retains the control and risk of scheduling and in most cases market selection local seat pricing and inventory for its flights although the company and its regional carriers may coordinate schedules to maximize connections

aircraft fuel the table below summarizes ual’s aircraft fuel consumption and expense during the last three years 

 

  

a calculation excludes special charges identified in note 16 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

the availability and price of aircraft fuel significantly affect the company’s operations results of operations financial position and liquidity to provide adequate supplies of fuel the company routinely enters into shortterm and longterm purchase contracts that are generally indexed to floating market prices for aircraft fuel and the company has some ability to store fuel close to its major hub locations to lower its exposure to unpredictable increases in the floating market prices of aircraft fuel the company may hedge a portion of its planned fuel requirements the company generally employs commonly used financial hedge instruments based on aircraft fuel or closely related commodities including diesel fuel and crude oil 

thirdparty business united generates thirdparty business revenue that includes fuel sales catering ground handling maintenance services and frequent flyer award nonair redemptions and thirdparty business revenue is recorded in other operating revenue united also incurs thirdparty business expenses such as maintenance ground handling and catering services for third parties fuel sales and nonair mileage redemptions and those thirdparty business expenses are recorded in other operating expenses 

  

distribution channels the company’s airline seat inventory and fares are distributed through the company’s direct channels traditional travel agencies and online travel agencies the use of the company’s direct sales website unitedcom the company’s mobile applications and alternative distribution systems provides the company with an opportunity to decommoditize its services better present its content make more targeted offerings better retain its customers enhance its brand and lower its ticket distribution costs agency sales are primarily sold using global distribution systems “gds” united has developed capabilities to sell certain ancillary products through the gds channel to provide an enhanced buying experience for customers who purchase in that channel to increase the company’s opportunities to sell its full range of products and services and lower distribution costs the company will continue to develop new selling capabilities in thirdparty channels and expand the capabilities of its website and mobile applications 

industry conditions 

domestic competition the domestic airline industry is highly competitive and dynamic the company’s competitors consist primarily of other airlines and to a certain extent other forms of transportation currently any us carrier deemed fit by the dot is free to operate scheduled passenger service between any two points within the united states competition can be direct in the form of another carrier flying the exact nonstop route or indirect where a carrier serves the same two cities nonstop from an alternative airport in that city or via an itinerary requiring a connection at another airport air carriers’ cost structures are not uniform and there are numerous factors influencing cost structure carriers with lower costs may offer lower fares to passengers which could have a potential negative impact on the company’s revenues decisions on domestic pricing are based on intense competitive pressure exerted on the company by other us airlines in order to remain competitive and maintain passenger traffic levels we often find it necessary to match competitors’ discounted fares since we compete in a dynamic marketplace attempts to generate additional revenue through increased fares oftentimes fail 

international competition internationally the company competes not only with us airlines but also with foreign carriers international competition has increased and may increase in the future as a result of airline mergers and acquisitions joint ventures alliances restructurings liberalization of aviation bilateral agreements and new or increased service by competitors including government subsidized competitors from certain middle east countries competition on international routes is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation the company’s ability to compete successfully with nonus carriers on international routes depends in part on its ability to generate traffic to and from the entire united states via its integrated domestic route network and its ability to overcome business and operational challenges across its network worldwide foreign carriers currently are prohibited by us law from carrying local passengers between two points in the united states and the company experiences comparable restrictions in foreign countries except where “fifth freedom rights” have been negotiated between the us government and other countries in addition in the absence of open skies and fifth freedom rights us carriers are constrained from carrying passengers to points beyond designated international gateway cities due to limitations in air service agreements and restrictions imposed unilaterally by foreign governments to compensate partially for these structural limitations us and foreign carriers have entered into alliances joint ventures and marketing arrangements that enable these carriers to exchange traffic between each other’s flights and route networks see alliances above for additional information 

seasonality the air travel business is subject to seasonal fluctuations historically demand for air travel is higher in the second and third quarters driving higher revenues than in the first and fourth quarters which are periods of lower travel demand 

industry regulation 

domestic regulation 

all carriers engaged in air transportation in the united states are subject to regulation by the dot absent an exemption no air carrier may provide air transportation of passengers or property without first being issued a dot certificate of public convenience and necessity the dot also grants international route authority approves 

  

international codeshare arrangements and regulates methods of competition the dot regulates consumer protection and maintains jurisdiction over advertising denied boarding compensation tarmac delays baggage liability and other areas and may add additional expensive regulatory burdens in the future the dot has launched investigations or claimed rulemaking authority to regulate commercial agreements among carriers or between carriers and third parties in a wide variety of contexts 

airlines are also regulated by the federal aviation administration the “faa” an agency within the dot primarily in the areas of flight safety air carrier operations and aircraft maintenance and airworthiness the faa issues air carrier operating certificates and aircraft airworthiness certificates prescribes maintenance procedures oversees airport operations and regulates pilot and other employee training from time to time the faa issues directives that require air carriers to inspect or modify aircraft and other equipment potentially causing the company to incur substantial unplanned expenses the airline industry is also subject to numerous other federal laws and regulations the us department of homeland security “dhs” has jurisdiction over virtually every aspect of civil aviation security the antitrust division of the us department of justice “doj” has jurisdiction over certain airline competition matters the us postal service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail by airlines labor relations in the airline industry are generally governed by the railway labor act “rla” a federal statute the company is also subject to investigation inquiries by the dot faa doj dhs and other us and international regulatory bodies 

airport access access to landing and takeoff rights or “slots” at several major us airports and many foreign airports served by the company are or recently have been subject to government regulation federally mandated domestic slot restrictions currently apply at reagan national airport in washington dc and at john f kennedy international airport “jfk” laguardia airport “laguardia” and newark liberty in the metropolitan new york region in addition to address concerns about airport congestion the faa has imposed operating restrictions at certain airports including newark liberty jfk and laguardia which may include capacity reductions additional restrictions on airline routes and takeoff and landing slots at these and other airports may be proposed in the future that could affect the company’s rights of ownership and transfer in january 2015 the faa issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to revise and alter the current methods to manage congestion and delay at the new york area’s three major commercial airports which may alter use of slots and congestion at those airports 

legislation the airline industry is subject to legislative activity that may have an impact on operations and costs in 2016 the us congress will continue to consider legislation to reauthorize the faa which encompasses all significant aviation tax and policyrelated issues as with previous reauthorization legislation the us congress may consider a range of policy changes that could impact operations and costs climate change legislation is also likely to be a significant area of legislative and regulatory focus and could adversely impact the company’s costs see environmental regulation  below 

finally aviation security continues to be the subject of legislative and regulatory action requiring changes to the company’s security processes increasing the cost of its security procedures and affecting its operations 

international regulation 

international air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation in connection with the company’s international services the company is regulated by both the us government and the governments of the foreign countries the company serves in addition the availability of international routes to us carriers is regulated by aviation agreements between the us and foreign governments and in some cases fares and schedules require the approval of the dot andor the relevant foreign governments 

legislation foreign countries are increasingly enacting passenger protection laws rules and regulations that meet or exceed us requirements in cases where this activity exceeds us requirements additional burden and liability may be placed on the company certain countries have regulations requiring passenger compensation andor enforcement penalties from the company in addition to changes in operating procedures due to canceled and delayed flights 

  

airport access historically access to foreign markets has been tightly controlled through bilateral agreements between the us and each foreign country involved these agreements regulate the markets served the number of carriers allowed to serve each market and the frequency of carriers’ flights since the early 1990s the us has pursued a policy of “open skies” meaning all usflag carriers have access to the destination under which the us government has negotiated a number of bilateral agreements allowing unrestricted access between us and foreign markets currently there are more than 100 open skies agreements in effect however many of the airports that the company serves in europe asia and latin america maintain slot controls a large number of these are restrictive due to congestion at these airports london heathrow international airport frankfurt rheinmain airport shanghai pudong international airport beijing capital international airport sao paulo guarulhos international airport and tokyo haneda international airport are among the most restrictive foreign airports due to capacity limitations 

the company’s ability to serve some foreign markets and expand into certain others is limited by the absence of aviation agreements between the us government and the relevant foreign governments shifts in us or foreign government aviation policies may lead to the alteration or termination of air service agreements depending on the nature of any such change the value of the company’s international route authorities and slot rights may be materially enhanced or diminished 

environmental regulation 

the airline industry is subject to increasingly stringent federal state local and international environmental requirements including emissions to air water discharges safe drinking water and the use and management of hazardous substances and wastes 

climate change  there is an increasing global regulatory focus on greenhouse gas “ghg” emissions and their potential impacts relating to climate change initiatives to regulate ghg emissions from aviation have been underway in the european union “eu” since 2009 but applicability to flights arriving or departing from airports outside the eu was postponed to provide the international civil aviation organization “icao” the opportunity to reach agreement on a global approach for international aviation icao is expected to reach a resolution in 2016 advancing a global marketbased measure for international aviation emissions starting in 2021 separately in 2016 icao is expected to adopt a carbon dioxide “co2” standard for aircraft and the us environmental protection agency has already started the process required to adopt such an aircraft standard in consideration of these future requirements the company is taking various actions that will help to reduce its co2 emissions such as fleet renewal aircraft retrofits and seeking to stimulate the commercialization of aviation alternative fuels 

other regulations  our operations are subject to a variety of other environmental laws and regulations both in the united states and internationally these include noiserelated restrictions on aircraft types and operating times which have or could in the future result in curtailments in services increased operating costs or limits on expansion certain foreign airports andor governments either have or are seeking to establish environmental fees applicable to carbon emissions local air quality pollutants andor noise in the united states new regulations affecting storm water and underground storage tanks became effective in 2015 which could affect airport fuel hydrant systems or airport storm water management potentially impacting operating costs also in october 2015 a final rule to reduce the national ambient air quality standards for ozone was issued which if upheld is expected to trigger restrictions on mobile sources such as cars trucks and airport ground support equipment in certain jurisdictions finally environmental cleanup laws can require the company to undertake or subject the company to liability for investigation and remediation costs at owned or leased locations or third party disposal locations 

until applicability of new regulations to our specific operations is better defined or in the case of the referenced ghg and ozone standards these implementation measures are actually developed future costs to comply with such regulations will remain uncertain while we continue to monitor these developments we do not currently believe that such developments or resulting expenditures will have a material impact on our capital expenditures or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations operating costs or competitive position 

  

employees 

as of december 31 2015 ual including its subsidiaries had approximately 84000 employees approximately 80 of the company’s employees were represented by various us labor organizations as of december 31 2015 

collective bargaining agreements between the company and its represented employee groups are negotiated under the rla such agreements typically do not contain an expiration date and instead specify an amendable date upon which the contract is considered “open for amendment” the company has reached joint collective bargaining agreements with the majority of its employee groups since the merger transaction in 2010 the company continues to negotiate in mediation for a joint flight attendant collective bargaining agreement extensions to the iam represented employees’ agreements and a joint technician and related employees’ collective bargaining agreement following the rejected proposal for ratification of a joint technician and related employees’ agreement the company can provide no assurance that a successful or timely resolution of these labor negotiations will be achieved 

  

the following table reflects the company’s represented employee groups number of employees per represented group union representation for each of united’s employee groups where applicable and the amendable date for each employee group’s collective bargaining agreement 

 

  

a the table includes the company’s us and guam union represented employees only 

b the respective amendable dates for those joint negotiations in progress reflect the remaining united continental airlines inc “continental” andor continental micronesia inc standalone agreements 

the company cannot predict the outcome of negotiations with its unionized employee groups although significant increases in the pay and benefits resulting from new collective bargaining agreements would have an adverse financial impact on the company see notes 15 and 16 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information on labor negotiations and costs 

  

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend the following risk factors should be read carefully when evaluating the company’s business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this report and other statements the company or its representatives make from time to time any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect the company’s business operating results financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this report 

global economic political and industry conditions constantly change and unfavorable conditions may have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations 

the company’s business and results of operations are significantly impacted by general economic and industry conditions the airline industry is highly cyclical and the level of demand for air travel is correlated to the strength of the us and global economies the company is a global business with operations outside of the united states from which it derives significant operating revenues the company’s international operations are a vital part of its worldwide airline network volatile economic political and market conditions in these international regions may have a negative impact on the company’s operating results and its ability to achieve its business objectives 

robust demand for the company’s air transportation services depends largely on favorable economic conditions including the strength of the domestic and foreign economies low unemployment levels strong consumer confidence levels and the availability of consumer and business credit air transportation is often a discretionary purchase that leisure travelers may limit or eliminate during difficult economic times in addition during periods of unfavorable economic conditions business travelers usually reduce the volume of their travel either due to costsaving initiatives or as a result of decreased business activity requiring travel during such periods the company’s business and results of operations may be adversely affected due to significant declines in industry passenger demand particularly with respect to the company’s business and premium cabin travelers and a reduction in fare levels 

stagnant or weakening global economic conditions either in the united states or in other geographic regions and any future volatility in us and global financial and credit markets may have a material adverse effect on the company’s revenues results of operations and liquidity if such economic conditions were to disrupt capital markets in the future the company may be unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all to refinance certain maturing debt and to satisfy future capital commitments 

in addition significant or volatile changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies may have a material adverse impact upon the company’s liquidity revenues costs and operating results 

the airline industry is highly competitive and susceptible to price discounting and changes in capacity which could have a material adverse effect on the company 

the us airline industry is characterized by substantial price competition including from lowcost carriers the significant market presence of lowcost carriers which engage in substantial price discounting may diminish our ability to achieve sustained profitability on domestic and international routes 

airlines also compete for market share by increasing or decreasing their capacity including route systems and the number of markets served several of the company’s domestic and international competitors have increased their international capacity by including service to some destinations that the company currently serves causing overlap in destinations served and therefore increasing competition for those destinations in addition the company has implemented significant capacity reductions in recent years in response to high and volatile fuel prices and stagnant global economic growth this increased competition in both domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

  

terrorist attacks or international hostilities or the fear of terrorist attacks or hostilities even if not made directly on the airline industry could negatively affect the company and the airline industry 

the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 involving commercial aircraft severely and adversely impacted the company’s financial condition and results of operations as well as the prospects for the airline industry among the effects experienced from the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks were substantial flight disruption costs caused by the faaimposed temporary grounding of the us airline industry’s fleet significantly increased security costs and associated passenger inconvenience increased insurance costs substantially higher ticket refunds and significantly decreased traffic and passenger revenue 

additional terrorist attacks even if not made directly on the airline industry or the fear of or the precautions taken in anticipation of such attacks including elevated national threat warnings or selective cancellation or redirection of flights could materially and adversely affect the company and the airline industry wars and other international hostilities could also have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition liquidity and results of operations the company’s financial resources may not be sufficient to absorb the adverse effects of any future terrorist attacks or other international hostilities 

a significant data breach or the company’s inability to comply with legislative or regulatory standards may adversely affect the company’s business 

the company is subject to increasing legislative regulatory and customer focus on privacy issues and data security a number of the company’s commercial partners including credit card companies have imposed data security standards that the company must meet and these standards continue to evolve the company will continue its efforts to meet new and increasing privacy and security standards however it is possible that certain new standards may be difficult to meet and could increase the company’s costs additionally any compromise of the company’s technology systems could result in the loss disclosure misappropriation of or access to customers’ employees’ or business partners’ information any such loss disclosure misappropriation or access could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information any significant data breach or the company’s failure to comply with applicable us and foreign privacy or data security regulations or security standards imposed by the company’s commercial partners may adversely affect the company’s reputation business results of operations and financial condition 

the company relies heavily on technology and automated systems to operate its business and any significant failure or disruption of the technology or these systems could materially harm its business 

the company depends on automated systems and technology to operate its business including computerized airline reservation systems flight operations systems revenue management systems accounting systems telecommunication systems and commercial websites including wwwunitedcom united’s website and other automated systems must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic maintain secure information and deliver important flight and schedule information as well as process critical financial transactions these systems could suffer substantial or repeated disruptions due to various events some of which are beyond the company’s control including natural disasters power failures terrorist attacks equipment or software failures computer viruses or cyber security attacks substantial or repeated systems failures or disruptions including failures or disruptions related to the company’s complex integration of systems could reduce the attractiveness of the company’s services versus those of its competitors materially impair its ability to market its services and operate its flights result in the unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information result in increased costs lost revenue and the loss or compromise of important data and may adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

current or future litigation and regulatory actions could have a material adverse impact on the company 

from time to time we are subject to litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings relating to our business or investigations or other actions by governmental agencies including as described in part i item 3 “legal 

  

proceedings” of this annual report no assurances can be given that the results of these or new matters will be favorable to us an adverse resolution of lawsuits arbitrations investigations or other proceedings or actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations including as a result of nonmonetary remedies defending ourselves in these matters may be timeconsuming expensive and disruptive to normal business operations and may result in significant expense and a diversion of management’s time and attention from the operation of our business which could impede our ability to achieve our business objectives additionally any amount that we may be required to pay to satisfy a judgment settlement fine or penalty may not be covered by insurance under our charter and certain indemnification agreements that we have entered into and may in the future enter into with our officers directors and certain third parties we could be required to indemnify and advance expenses to them in connection with their involvement in certain actions suits investigations and other proceedings there can be no assurance that any of these payments will not be material 

disruptions to the company’s regional network and united express flights provided by thirdparty regional carriers could adversely affect the company’s operations and financial condition 

the company has contractual relationships with various regional carriers to provide regional jet and turboprop service branded as united express these regional operations are an extension of the company’s mainline network and complement the company’s operations by carrying traffic that connects to mainline service and allows flights to smaller cities that cannot be provided economically with mainline aircraft the company’s business and operations are dependent on its regional flight network with regional capacity accounting for approximately 12 of the company’s total as of december 31 2015 

although the company has agreements with its regional carriers that include contractually agreed performance metrics the company does not control the operations of these carriers a number of factors may impact the company’s regional network including weatherrelated effects and seasonality in addition the decrease in qualified pilots driven by federal regulations has adversely impacted and could continue to affect the company’s regional flying for example the faa’s expansion of minimum pilot qualification standards including a requirement that a pilot have at least 1500 total flight hours as well as the faa’s revised pilot flight and duty time rules effective january 2014 have contributed to an increasing need for pilots for regional carriers the decrease in qualified pilots resulting from the regulations as well as factors including a decreased student pilot population and a shrinking us military from which to hire qualified pilots could adversely impact the company’s operations and financial condition and also require the company to reduce regional carrier flying 

if a significant disruption occurs to the company’s regional network or flights or if one or more of the regional carriers with which the company has relationships is unable to perform their obligations over an extended period of time there could be a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and operations 

the company’s business relies extensively on thirdparty service providers failure of these parties to perform as expected or interruptions in the company’s relationships with these providers or their provision of services to the company could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the company has engaged an increasing number of thirdparty service providers to perform a large number of functions that are integral to its business including regional operations operation of customer service call centers distribution and sale of airline seat inventory provision of information technology infrastructure and services transmitting or uploading of data provision of aircraft maintenance and repairs provision of various utilities and performance of aircraft fueling operations among other vital functions and services the company does not directly control these thirdparty service providers although it does enter into agreements with many of them that define expected service performance any of these thirdparty service providers however may materially fail to meet their service performance commitments to the company may suffer disruptions to their systems that could impact their services or the agreements with such providers may be terminated for example flight reservations booked by customers and travel agencies via thirdparty gdss may be adversely affected by disruptions in the business relationships between the company and gds operators such disruptions including a failure to agree upon acceptable contract terms when contracts expire or otherwise become subject to 

  

renegotiation may cause the company’s flight information to be limited or unavailable for display significantly increase fees for both the company and gds users and impair the company’s relationships with its customers and travel agencies the failure of any of the company’s thirdparty service providers to perform their service obligations adequately or other interruptions of services may reduce the company’s revenues and increase its expenses prevent the company from operating its flights and providing other services to its customers or result in adverse publicity or harm to its brand in addition the company’s business and financial performance could be materially harmed if its customers believe that its services are unreliable or unsatisfactory 

the company could experience adverse publicity harm to its brand reduced travel demand and potential tort liability as a result of an accident catastrophe or incident involving its aircraft the aircraft of its regional carriers or the aircraft of its codeshare partners which may result in a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial position 

an accident catastrophe or incident involving an aircraft that the company operates or an aircraft that is operated by a codeshare partner or one of the company’s regional carriers could have a material adverse effect on the company if such accident catastrophe or incident created a public perception that the company’s operations or the operations of its codeshare partners or regional carriers are not safe or reliable or are less safe or reliable than other airlines such public perception could in turn result in adverse publicity for the company cause harm to the company’s brand and reduce travel demand on the company’s flights or the flights of its codeshare partners or regional carriers 

in addition any such accident catastrophe or incident could expose the company to significant tort liability although the company currently maintains liability insurance in amounts and of the type the company believes to be consistent with industry practice to cover damages arising from any such accident or catastrophe and the company’s codeshare partners and regional carriers carry similar insurance and generally indemnify the company for their operations if the company’s liability exceeds the applicable policy limits or the ability of another carrier to indemnify it the company could incur substantial losses from an accident catastrophe or incident which may result in a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial position 

if we experience changes in or are unable to retain our senior management team or other key employees our operating results could be adversely affected 

much of our future success depends on the continued availability of skilled personnel with industry experience and knowledge including our senior management team and other key employees if we are unable to attract and retain talented highly qualified senior management and other key employees or if we are unable to effectively provide for the succession of senior management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer our business may be adversely affected 

high andor volatile fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a material adverse impact on the company’s strategic plans operating results financial position and liquidity 

aircraft fuel is critical to the company’s operations and is one of its largest operating expenses aircraft fuel has also been the company’s most volatile operating expense for the past several years the company generally sources adequate supplies of fuel at prevailing market prices and has some ability to store fuel close to major hub locations to ensure supply continuity in the short term timely and adequate supply of aircraft fuel depends on the continued availability of reliable fuel supply sources and delivery infrastructure although the company has some ability to cover shortterm supply and infrastructure disruptions at its major demand locations it can neither predict nor guarantee the continued timely availability of aircraft fuel throughout the company’s system 

market prices for aircraft fuel depend on a multitude of unpredictable factors beyond the company’s control these factors include changes in global crude oil prices aircraft fuel supplydemand balance inventory levels and fuel production and transportation capacity as well as indirect factors such as geopolitical events economic 

  

growth indicators fiscalmonetary policies fuel tax policies and financial investments both actual changes as well as changes in market expectations of these factors can potentially drive rapid changes in fuel price levels and price volatility 

given the highly competitive nature of the airline industry the company may not be able to increase its fares and fees sufficiently to offset the full impact of increases in fuel prices especially if these increases are significant rapid and sustained further such fare and fee increases may not be sustainable may reduce the general demand for air travel and may also eventually impact the company’s strategic growth and investment plans for the future in addition decreases in fuel prices for an extended period may result in increased industry capacity increased competitive actions for market share and lower fares or surcharges in general if fuel prices were subsequently to rise quickly there may be a lag between improvement of revenue and the adverse impact of higher fuel prices 

to protect against increases in the market prices of fuel the company may hedge a portion of its future fuel requirements however the company’s hedging program may not be successful in mitigating higher fuel costs and any price protection provided may be limited due to choice of hedging instruments and market conditions including breakdown of correlation between hedging instrument and market price of aircraft fuel and failure of hedge counterparties to the extent that the company decides to hedge a portion of its future fuel requirements and uses hedge contracts that have the potential to create an obligation to pay upon settlement if fuel prices decline significantly such hedge contracts may limit the company’s ability to benefit fully from lower fuel costs in the future if fuel prices decline significantly from the levels existing at the time the company enters into a hedge contract the company may be required to post collateral margin beyond certain thresholds there can be no assurance that the company’s hedging arrangements will provide any particular level of protection against rises in fuel prices or that its counterparties will be able to perform under the company’s hedging arrangements additionally deterioration in the company’s financial condition could negatively affect its ability to enter into new hedge contracts in the future and may potentially require the company to post increased amounts of collateral under its fuel hedging agreements 

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 and regulations promulgated by the commodity futures trading commission the “cftc” require centralized clearing for overthecounter derivatives and recordkeeping and reporting requirements that are applicable to the company’s fuel hedge contracts the ual board of directors “board of directors” has approved the company’s election of the cftc’s enduser exception which permits the company as a nonfinancial end user of derivatives to hedge commercial risk and be exempt from the cftc mandatory clearing requirements however several of the company’s hedge counterparties are also subject to these requirements which may raise the counterparties’ costs those increased costs may in turn be passed on to the company resulting in increased transaction costs to execute hedge contracts and lower credit thresholds to post collateral margin 

see note 10 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information on the company’s hedging programs 

union disputes employee strikes or slowdowns and other laborrelated disruptions as well as the integration of united’s workforces in connection with the company’s merger transaction in 2010 could adversely affect the company’s operations and could result in increased costs that impair its financial performance 

united is a highly unionized company as of december 31 2015 the company and its subsidiaries had approximately 84000 active employees of whom approximately 80 were represented by various us labor organizations 

the successful integration of united’s workforces in connection with the company’s merger transaction in 2010 and achievement of the anticipated benefits of the combined company depend in part on integrating employee groups and maintaining productive employee relations in order to fully integrate the company’s premerger represented employee groups the company must negotiate a joint collective bargaining agreement covering each combined group the process for integrating the labor groups is governed by a combination of the rla the mccaskillbond amendment and where applicable the existing provisions of collective bargaining agreements 

  

and union policies a delay in or failure to integrate employee groups presents the potential for increased operating costs and labor disputes that could adversely affect the company’s operations 

the company has reached joint collective bargaining agreements with the majority of its employee groups since the merger transaction in 2010 with only two groups remaining without combined collective bargaining agreements we continue to negotiate for a joint flight attendant collective bargaining agreement and its technician and related employees are in the process of submitting a recent company proposal for ratification by its membership the company can provide no assurance that a successful or timely resolution of these labor negotiations will be achieved 

there is a risk that unions or individual employees might pursue judicial or arbitral claims arising out of changes implemented as a result of the company’s merger transaction in 2010 there is also a possibility that employees or unions could engage in job actions such as slowdowns worktorule campaigns sickouts or other actions designed to disrupt the company’s normal operations in an attempt to pressure the company in collective bargaining negotiations although the rla makes such actions unlawful until the parties have been lawfully released to selfhelp and the company can seek injunctive relief against premature selfhelp such actions can cause significant harm even if ultimately enjoined in addition joint collective bargaining agreements with the company’s represented employee groups increase the company’s labor costs which increase could be material for any applicable reporting period 

see notes 15 and 16 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information on labor negotiations and costs 

an outbreak of a disease or similar public health threat could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business financial position and results of operations 

an outbreak of a disease or similar public health threat that affects travel demand or travel behavior or travel restrictions or reduction in the demand for air travel caused by an outbreak of a disease or similar public health threat in the future could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

extensive government regulation could increase the company’s operating costs and restrict its ability to conduct its business 

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal oversight compliance with us and international regulations imposes significant costs and may have adverse effects on the company laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges both domestically and internationally have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce airline revenue 

united provides air transportation under certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by the dot if the dot altered amended modified suspended or revoked these certificates it could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business the faa regulates the safety of united’s operations united operates pursuant to an air carrier operating certificate issued by the faa in january 2014 the faa’s more stringent pilot flight and duty time requirements under part 117 of the federal aviation regulations took effect which has increased costs for all carriers in july 2014 minimum qualifications took effect for air carrier first officers these regulations impact the company and its regional partner flying as they have caused mainline airlines to hire regional pilots while simultaneously significantly reducing the pool of new pilots from which regional carriers themselves can hire although this is an industry issue it directly affects the company and requires it to reduce regional partner flying as several regional partners have experienced difficulty flying their schedules due to reduced pilot availability from time to time the faa also issues orders airworthiness directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require material expenditures or operational restrictions by the company these faa orders and directives could include the temporary grounding of an entire aircraft type if the faa identifies design manufacturing maintenance or other issues requiring immediate corrective action faa requirements cover among other things retirement of older aircraft collision avoidance 

  

systems airborne windshear avoidance systems noise abatement and other environmental concerns aircraft operation and safety and increased inspections and maintenance procedures to be conducted on older aircraft these faa directives or requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company 

in addition the company’s operations may be adversely impacted due to the existing antiquated air traffic control “atc” system utilized by the us government during peak travel periods in certain markets the current atc system’s inability to handle atc demand has led to shortterm capacity constraints imposed by government agencies and resulted in delays and disruptions of air traffic in addition the current system will not be able to effectively handle projected future air traffic growth imposition of these atc constraints on a longterm basis may have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations failure to update the atc system in a timely manner and the substantial funding requirements of a modernized atc system that may be imposed on air carriers may have an adverse impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

access to landing and takeoff rights or “slots” at several major us airports and many foreign airports served by the company are or recently have been subject to government regulation certain of the company’s major hubs are among the most congested airports in the united states and have been or could be the subject of regulatory action that might limit the number of flights andor increase costs of operations at certain times or throughout the day the faa may limit the company’s airport access by limiting the number of departure and arrival slots at high density traffic airports which could affect the company’s ownership and transfer rights and local airport authorities may have the ability to control access to certain facilities or the cost of access to their facilities which could have an adverse effect on the company’s business the faa historically has taken actions with respect to airlines’ slot holdings that airlines have challenged if the faa were to take actions that adversely affect the company’s slot holdings the company could incur substantial costs to preserve its slots or may lose slots further the company’s operating costs at airports including the company’s major hubs may increase significantly because of capital improvements at such airports that the company may be required to fund directly or indirectly such costs could be imposed by the relevant airport authority without the company’s approval and may have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition 

the ability of carriers to operate flights on international routes between the united states and other countries may be subject to change applicable arrangements between the united states and foreign governments may be amended from time to time government policies with respect to airport operations may be revised and the availability of appropriate slots or facilities may change the company currently operates a number of flights on international routes under government arrangements regulations or policies that designate the number of carriers permitted to operate on such routes the capacity of the carriers providing services on such routes the airports at which carriers may operate international flights or the number of carriers allowed access to particular airports any further limitations additions or modifications to such arrangements regulations or policies could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations additionally a change in law regulation or policy for any of the company’s international routes such as open skies could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial position and results of operations and could result in the impairment of material amounts of related tangible and intangible assets in addition competition from revenuesharing joint ventures and other alliance arrangements by and among other airlines could impair the value of the company’s business and assets on the open skies routes the company’s plans to enter into or expand us antitrust immunized alliances and joint ventures on various international routes are subject to receipt of approvals from applicable us federal authorities and obtaining other applicable foreign government clearances or satisfying the necessary applicable regulatory requirements there can be no assurance that such approvals and clearances will be granted or will continue in effect upon further regulatory review or that changes in regulatory requirements or standards can be satisfied 

many aspects of the company’s operations are also subject to increasingly stringent federal state local and international laws protecting the environment future environmental regulatory developments such as climate change regulations in the united states and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in the airline industry there are certain climate change laws and regulations that have already gone into effect 

  

and that apply to the company including the european union’s emissions trading scheme the state of california’s ghg cap and trade regulations environmental taxes for certain international flights limited ghg reporting requirements and landuse planning laws which could apply to airports and could affect airlines in certain circumstances in addition there is the potential for additional regulatory actions in regard to the emission of ghgs by the aviation industry the precise nature of future requirements and their applicability to the company are difficult to predict but the financial impact to the company and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant 

in 2016 the us congress will continue to consider legislation to reauthorize the faa which encompasses all significant aviation tax and policy related issues as with previous reauthorization legislation the us congress may consider a range of policy changes that could impact the company’s operations and costs 

see part i item 1 business—industry regulation of this report for additional information on government regulation impacting the company 

the airline industry may undergo further change with respect to alliances and joint ventures either of which could have a material adverse effect on the company 

the company faces and may continue to face strong competition from other carriers due to the modification of alliances and formation of new joint ventures carriers may improve their competitive positions through airline alliances slot swaps andor joint ventures certain types of airline joint ventures further competition by allowing multiple airlines to coordinate routes pool revenues and costs and enjoy other mutual benefits achieving many of the benefits of consolidation “open skies” agreements including the agreements between the united states and the european union and between the united states and japan may also give rise to better integration opportunities among international carriers movement of airlines between current global airline alliances could reduce joint network coverage for members of such alliances while also creating opportunities for joint ventures and bilateral alliances that did not exist before such realignment there is ongoing speculation that further airline and airline alliance consolidations or reorganizations could occur in the future especially if new “open skies” agreements between brazil and the united states and mexico and the united states are fully implemented the company routinely engages in analysis and discussions regarding its own strategic position including current and potential alliances asset acquisitions and divestitures and may have future discussions with other airlines regarding strategic activities if other airlines participate in such activities those airlines may significantly improve their cost structures or revenue generation capabilities thereby potentially making them stronger competitors of the company and potentially impairing the company’s ability to realize expected benefits from its own strategic relationships 

inadequate liquidity or a negative impact on the company’s liquidity from factors beyond the company’s control may have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position and business 

the company has a significant amount of financial leverage from fixed obligations including aircraft lease and debt financings leases of airport property and other facilities and other material cash obligations in addition the company has substantial noncancelable commitments for capital expenditures including for the acquisition of new aircraft and related spare engines 

although the company’s cash flows from operations and its available capital including the proceeds from financing transactions have been sufficient to meet these obligations and commitments to date the company’s future liquidity could be negatively affected by the risk factors discussed in this item 1a including but not limited to substantial volatility in the price of fuel adverse economic conditions disruptions in the global capital markets and catastrophic external events 

if the company’s liquidity is constrained due to the various risk factors noted in this item 1a or otherwise the company might not be able to timely pay its debts or comply with certain operating and financial covenants under its financing and credit card processing agreements or with other material provisions of its contractual obligations these covenants require the company or united as applicable to maintain minimum liquidity and 

  

or minimum collateral coverage ratios depending on the particular agreement the company’s ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond its control including the overall industry revenue environment the level of fuel costs and the appraised value of certain collateral 

if the company does not timely pay its debts or comply with such covenants a variety of adverse consequences could result these potential adverse consequences include an increase of required reserves under credit card processing agreements withholding of credit card sale proceeds by its credit card service providers loss of undrawn lines of credit the occurrence of one or more events of default under the relevant agreements the acceleration of the maturity of debt andor the exercise of other remedies by its creditors and equipment lessors that could result in a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations the company cannot provide assurance that it would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance such debt if it were accelerated in addition an event of default or acceleration of debt under certain of its financing agreements could result in one or more events of default under certain of the company’s other financing agreements due to cross default and cross acceleration provisions 

furthermore constrained liquidity may limit the company’s ability to withstand competitive pressures and downturns in the travel business and the economy in general 

the company’s substantial level of indebtedness and noninvestment grade credit rating as well as market conditions and the availability of assets as collateral for loans or other indebtedness may make it difficult for the company to raise additional capital if needed to meet its liquidity needs on acceptable terms or at all 

see part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report for additional information regarding the company’s liquidity 

increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage may materially and adversely impact the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

the company could be exposed to significant liability or loss if its property or operations were to be affected by a natural catastrophe or other event including aircraft accidents if the company is unable to obtain sufficient insurance including but not limited to aviation hull and liability insurance workers’ compensation and property and business interruption coverage to cover such liabilities or losses whether due to insurance market conditions or otherwise its results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

following the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 the company’s insurance costs increased significantly and the availability of thirdparty war risk terrorism insurance decreased significantly from september 2001 through may 2014 the company obtained thirdparty war risk terrorism insurance through a faaadministered program in anticipation of the government discontinuing this program effective may 2014 the company terminated its faaadministered insurance and returned to the commercial insurance markets to obtain thirdparty war risk terrorism insurance the government subsequently discontinued the faaadministered program in december 2014 if the company is unable in the future to obtain thirdparty war risk terrorism insurance with acceptable terms or if the coverage obtained is insufficient relative to actual liability or losses that the company experiences its results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

the company’s results of operations fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors associated with the airline industry 

due to greater demand for air travel during the spring and summer months revenues in the airline industry in the second and third quarters of the year are generally stronger than revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year which are periods of lower travel demand the company’s results of operations generally reflect this seasonality but have also been impacted by numerous other factors that are not necessarily seasonal including among others the imposition of excise and similar taxes extreme or severe weather atc control congestion geological events natural disasters changes in the competitive environment due to industry consolidation 

  

general economic conditions and other factors as a result the company’s quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year and historical operating results in a quarterly or annual period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 

the company may never realize the full value of its intangible assets or its longlived assets causing it to record impairments that may negatively affect its financial position and results of operations 

in accordance with applicable accounting standards the company is required to test its indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis on october 1 of each year or more frequently if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred in addition the company is required to test certain of its other assets for impairment if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred 

the company may be required to recognize impairments in the future due to among other factors extreme fuel price volatility tight credit markets a decline in the fair value of certain tangible or intangible assets unfavorable trends in historical or forecasted results of operations and cash flows and an uncertain economic environment as well as other uncertainties the company can provide no assurance that a material impairment charge of tangible or intangible assets will not occur in a future period the value of the company’s aircraft could be impacted in future periods by changes in supply and demand for these aircraft such changes in supply and demand for certain aircraft types could result from grounding of aircraft by the company or other carriers an impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the company’s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for us federal income tax purposes may be significantly limited due to various circumstances including certain possible future transactions involving the sale or issuance of ual common stock or if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels 

as of december 31 2015 ual reported consolidated federal net operating loss “nol” carryforwards of approximately 80 billion 

the company’s ability to use its nol carryforwards may be limited if it experiences an “ownership change” as defined in section 382 “section 382” of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended an ownership change generally occurs if certain stockholders increase their aggregate percentage ownership of a corporation’s stock by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest percentage ownership at any time during the testing period which is generally the threeyear period preceding any potential ownership change 

there is no assurance that the company will not experience a future ownership change under section 382 that may significantly limit or possibly eliminate its ability to use its nol carryforwards potential future transactions involving the sale or issuance of ual common stock including the exercise of conversion options under the terms of any convertible debt that ual may issue in the future the repurchase of such debt with ual common stock any issuance of ual common stock for cash and the acquisition or disposition of such stock by a stockholder owning 5 or more of ual common stock or a combination of such transactions may increase the possibility that the company will experience a future ownership change under section 382 

under section 382 a future ownership change would subject the company to additional annual limitations that apply to the amount of preownership change nols that may be used to offset postownership change taxable income this limitation is generally determined by multiplying the value of a corporation’s stock immediately before the ownership change by the applicable longterm taxexempt rate any unused annual limitation may subject to certain limits be carried over to later years and the limitation may under certain circumstances be increased by builtin gains in the assets held by such corporation at the time of the ownership change this limitation could cause the company’s us federal income taxes to be greater or to be paid earlier than they otherwise would be and could cause all or a portion of the company’s nol carryforwards to expire unused similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes the company’s ability to use its nol 

  

carryforwards will also depend on the amount of taxable income it generates in future periods its nol carryforwards may expire before the company can generate sufficient taxable income to use them in full 

ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation limits certain transfers of its stock which limits are intended to preserve our ability to use our nol carryforwards and these limits could have an effect on the market price of ual common stock 

to reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect on the company’s ability to use its nol carryforwards for federal income tax purposes ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains a 5 ownership limitation this limitation generally remains effective until february 1 2017 or until such later date as may be approved by the board of directors in its sole discretion the limitation prohibits i an acquisition by a single stockholder of shares that results in that stockholder owning 5 or more of ual common stock and ii any acquisition or disposition of common stock by a stockholder that already owns 5 or more of ual common stock unless prior written approval is granted by the board of directors 

any transfer of common stock in violation of these restrictions will be void and will be treated as if such transfer never occurred this provision of ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation may impair or prevent a sale of common stock by a stockholder and adversely affect the price at which a stockholder can sell ual common stock in addition this limitation may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the company creating a perception that a change in control cannot occur or otherwise discouraging takeover attempts that some stockholders may consider beneficial which could also adversely affect the market price of the ual common stock the company cannot predict the effect that this provision in ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation may have on the market price of the ual common stock for additional information regarding the 5 ownership limitation please refer to ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation available on the investor relations section of the company’s website at httpirunitedcom

 2016 outlook 

set forth below is a discussion of the principal matters that we believe could impact our financial and operating performance and cause our results of operations in future periods to differ materially from our historical operating results andor from our anticipated results of operations described in the forwardlooking statements in this report see item 1a risk factors of this report and the factors described under “forwardlooking information” below for additional discussion of these and other factors that could affect us 

the company is committed to improving the efficiency and quality of all aspects of its business in 2016 key initiatives for the year include improving our operational reliability and the handling of customers during irregular operations such as adverse weather refurbishing aircraft interiors investing in our airports and taking delivery of more than 30 new highlyefficient and customerpleasing aircraft 

economic conditions the economic outlook for the aviation industry in 2016 is characterized by expected slow or modest us and global economic growth in such conditions we expect a modest increase in the demand for air travel continuing economic uncertainty along with the strengthening us dollar is providing uncertainty in key asian and european markets and along with continued political and socioeconomic tensions in regions such as the middle east may result in diminished demand for air travel the global economy is also being impacted by declining oil prices putting pressure on certain geographic markets 

capacity over the past three years the company leveraged the flexibility of its fleet to better match capacity with market demand in 2016 the company expects consolidated asms to grow between 15 and 25 yearoveryear 

fuel the company’s average aircraft fuel price per gallon including related taxes was 194 in 2015 as compared to 299 in 2014 since 2014 the price of jet fuel has declined and remains volatile based on projected fuel consumption in 2016 a one dollar change in the price of a barrel of crude oil would change the company’s annual fuel expense by approximately 94 million to protect against increases in the prices of aircraft fuel the company may hedge a portion of its future fuel requirements 

labor as of december 31 2015 united had approximately 80 of employees represented by unions we are in the process of negotiating joint collective bargaining agreements with our technicians and flight attendants and negotiating extensions to the iam represented employees’ agreements the company cannot predict the outcome of negotiations with its unionized employee groups although significant increases in the pay and benefits resulting from new collective bargaining agreements would have a material financial impact on the company the cost associated with the ratification of the pilots’ agreement will add an additional approximate 15 points of nonfuel unit cost in both the firstquarter and fullyear 2016 versus 2015 

casm in 2016 the company expects casm excluding fuel thirdparty business expense profit sharing special charges and the impact of the recently ratified pilot agreement to be up between 05 and 15 year overyear we are unable to project casm on a gaap basis as the nature and amount of special charges are not determinable at this time 

  

the company’s cost initiative project that began in 2014 has a goal to reduce the company’s annual costs by 2 billion and generate an incremental 700 million in additional ancillary revenue by the end of 2017 the anticipated savings are comprised of 1 billion in annual fuel savings based on fuel prices in 2013 and 1 billion of nonfuel savings in 2015 the company achieved approximately 555 million in fuel savings and 851 million in nonfuel savings 

income taxes the company anticipates its effective tax rate will be approximately 37 which reflects a more normalized rate after the release of the tax valuation allowance in 2015 and is based on the company’s relative mix of domestic foreign and state income tax expense

 the table below presents the company’s selected passenger revenue and selected operating data based on geographic region regional flights consist primarily of domestic routes 

 

  a see part ii item 6 of this report for the definition of these statistics 

  

consolidated passenger revenue in 2015 decreased 977 million or 29 as compared to 2014 primarily due to a decrease in consolidated yield of 43 yearoveryear yields were impacted by a competitive domestic fare environment unfavorable foreign currency results due to the strengthening of the us dollar international surcharge declines travel reductions from corporate customers in the energy sector and increased industry capacity in certain regions the decline in yields was partially offset by a 15 yearoveryear increase in traffic 

operating expense 

the table below includes data related to the company’s operating expense for the year ended december 31 in millions except percentage changes 

 

 salaries and related costs increased 778 million or 87 in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to a 463 million increase in profit sharing costs as a result of improved profitability higher pay rates driven by new collective bargaining agreements an increase in medical and dental costs and an increase in pension expense resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions 

the decrease in aircraft fuel expense was primarily attributable to decreased fuel prices partially offset by losses from fuel hedging activity and a 16 increase in capacity the table below presents the significant changes in aircraft fuel cost per gallon for the year ended december 31 in millions except percentage changes 

 

 depreciation and amortization increased 140 million or 83 in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to additions in owned property and equipment specifically related to new aircraft information technology assets and several aircraft capital lease conversions from operating leases 

  

aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs decreased 128 million or 72 in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to a yearoveryear decrease in significant airframe maintenance visits as a result of the cyclical timing of these visits improvements in the efficiency of inhouse maintenance programs a reduced volume of seat and landing gear maintenance and a reduction of flying hours under certain powerbythehour engine maintenance agreements partially offset by increases in expenses related to aircraft reliability projects and wifi systems maintenance 

aircraft rent decreased 129 million or 146 in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to lease expirations the purchase or capital lease conversion of several operating leased aircraft and lower lease renewal rates for certain aircraft

 the table below presents the company’s selected passenger revenue and selected operating data based on geographic region regional flights consist primarily of domestic routes 

 

  

 a see part ii item 6 of this report for the definition of these statistics 

consolidated passenger revenue in 2014 increased 640 million or 19 as compared to 2013 this increase was primarily due to an increase in consolidated yield of 17 and an increase in average fare per passenger of 28 there was also an increase in capacity and traffic of 03 and 02 respectively as compared to 2013 the 2014 average fare increase was due in part to a strong domestic demand environment and a number of new longhaul routes that generated higher fares than the system average also in 2014 the company improved its revenue management demand forecast process related to closein bookings which improved yields 2013 consolidated passenger revenue was negatively impacted by factors including additional competitive capacity in china and the japanese yen weakening against the us dollar resulting in lower pacific yields 

cargo revenue increased by 56 million or 63 in 2014 as compared to 2013 which was primarily due to higher freight volumes and an improvement in mail revenue yearoveryear partially offset by lower yield on freight 

other operating revenue decreased 74 million or 17 in 2014 as compared to 2013 which was primarily due to the company’s decision to discontinue sales of aircraft fuel to a third party partially offset by increases in ancillary mileageplus and contract services revenue 

  

operating expense 

the table below includes data related to the company’s operating expense for the year ended december 31 in millions except percentage changes

 see note 16 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information 

nonoperating income expense 

the following table illustrates the yearoveryear dollar and percentage changes in ual’s nonoperating income expense in millions except percentage changes 

 

 the decrease in interest expense of 48 million or 61 in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to the company’s extinguishment of certain of its debt instruments and the refinancing of certain of its debt instruments at lower interest rates 

in 2014 miscellaneous net included a mtm loss of 462 million from fuel derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting as compared to a gain of 79 million in 2013 miscellaneous net also included foreign currency losses of 41 million and 29 million in 2014 and 2013 respectively 2014 miscellaneous net includes a 64 million debt extinguishment charge related to the retirement of the 248 million 6 convertible junior subordinated debentures due 2030

as is the case with many of our principal competitors we have a high proportion of debt compared to capital we have a significant amount of fixed obligations including debt aircraft leases and financings leases of airport property and other facilities and pension funding obligations at december 31 2015 the company had approximately 118 billion of debt and capital lease obligations including 14 billion that are due within the next 12 months in addition we have substantial noncancelable commitments for capital expenditures including the acquisition of new aircraft and related spare engines as of december 31 2015 our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by approximately 46 billion however approximately 59 billion of our current liabilities are related to our advance ticket sales and frequent flyer deferred revenue both of which largely represent revenue to be recognized for travel in the near future and not actual cash outlays the deficit in working capital does not have an adverse impact to our cash flows liquidity or operations the company made principal payments of debt and capital lease obligations totaling 23 billion in 2015 

the company will continue to evaluate opportunities to prepay its debt including open market repurchases to reduce its indebtedness and related interest 

for 2016 the company expects between 27 billion and 29 billion of gross capital expenditures see notes 11 and 15 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information on commitments

other liquidity matters 

below is a summary of additional liquidity matters see the indicated notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional details related to these and other matters affecting our liquidity and commitments 

 

 contractual obligations the company’s business is capital intensive requiring significant amounts of capital to fund the acquisition of assets particularly aircraft in the past the company has funded the acquisition of aircraft through outright purchase by issuing debt by entering into capital or operating leases or through vendor financings the company also often enters into longterm lease commitments with airports to ensure access to terminal cargo maintenance and other required facilities 

  

the table below provides a summary of the company’s material contractual obligations as of december 31 2015 in billions 

 

       offbalance sheet arrangements an offbalance sheet arrangement is any transaction agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has 1 made guarantees 2 a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets 3 an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or 4 any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support or that engages in leasing hedging or research and development arrangements the company’s primary offbalance sheet arrangements include operating leases which are summarized in the contractual obligations table in contractual obligations above and certain municipal bond obligations as discussed below 

as of december 31 2015 united had cash collateralized 70 million of letters of credit united also had 437 million of performance bonds relating to various real estate customs and aircraft financing obligations at december 31 2015 most of the letters of credit have evergreen clauses and are expected to be renewed on an annual basis and the performance bonds have expiration dates through 2019

bodies the leasing arrangements associated with a majority of these obligations are accounted for as operating leases the leasing arrangements associated with a portion of these obligations are accounted for as capital leases the annual lease payments for those obligations accounted for as operating leases are included in the operating lease payments in the contractual obligations table above 

eetcs in november 2015 and august 2014 united completed two separate eetc offerings for a total principal amount of 15 billion united has received and recorded all of the proceeds from these offerings as debt as of december 31 2015 see notes 11 and 14 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information on eetc passthrough trusts and variable interest entity consideration 

increased cost provisions see note 15 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information on increased cost provisions related to the company’s debt 

fuel consortia united participates in numerous fuel consortia with other air carriers at major airports to reduce the costs of fuel distribution and storage interline agreements govern the rights and responsibilities of the consortia members and provide for the allocation of the overall costs to operate the consortia based on usage the consortia and in limited cases the participating carriers have entered into longterm agreements to lease certain airport fuel storage and distribution facilities that are typically financed through taxexempt bonds either special facilities lease revenue bonds or general airport revenue bonds issued by various local municipalities in general each consortium lease agreement requires the consortium to make lease payments in amounts sufficient to pay the maturing principal and interest payments on the bonds as of december 31 2015 approximately 13 billion principal amount of such bonds were secured by significant fuel facility leases in which united participates as to which united and each of the signatory airlines has provided indirect guarantees of the debt as of december 31 2015 the company’s contingent exposure was approximately 224 million principal amount of such bonds based on its recent consortia participation the company’s contingent exposure could increase if the participation of other air carriers decreases the guarantees will expire when the taxexempt bonds are paid in full which ranges from 2017 to 2041 the company did not record a liability at the time these indirect guarantees were made see note 15 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information related to the company’s fuel consortia 

critical accounting policies 

critical accounting policies are defined as those that are affected by significant judgments and uncertainties which potentially could result in materially different accounting under different assumptions and conditions the company has prepared the financial statements in conformity with gaap which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions the company has identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of the financial statements 

revenue recognition the company records passenger ticket sales and tickets sold by other airlines for use on united as passenger revenue when the transportation is provided or upon estimated breakage the value of unused passenger tickets is included in current liabilities as advance ticket sales tickets sold by other airlines are recorded at the estimated values to be billed to the other airlines differences between amounts billed and the actual amounts may be rejected and rebilled or written off if the amount recorded was different from the original estimate when necessary the company records a reserve against our interline billings and payables if historical experience indicates that these amounts are different nonrefundable tickets generally expire on the date of the intended flight unless the date is extended by notification from the customer on or before the intended flight date 

fees charged in association with changes or extensions to nonrefundable tickets are recorded as other revenue at the time the fee is incurred the fare on the changed ticket including any additional collection of fare is deferred and recognized in accordance with our transportation revenue recognition policy at the time the transportation is provided change fees related to nonrefundable tickets are considered a separate transaction from the air transportation because they represent a charge for the company’s additional service to modify a previous sale therefore the pricing of the change fee and the initial customer order are separately determined and represent distinct earnings processes 

  

the company records an estimate of breakage revenue on the flight date for tickets that will expire unused these estimates are based on the evaluation of actual historical results and forecasted trends refundable tickets expire after one year from the date of issuance 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” amended the fasb accounting standards codification and created a new topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers  this amendment prescribes that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the amendment supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in topic 605 revenue recognition  and most industryspecific guidance throughout the industry topics of the codification the amendment will become effective for the company’s annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december 15 2017 under the new standard certain airline ancillary fees directly related to passenger revenue tickets such as airline change fees and baggage fees are likely to no longer be considered distinct performance obligations separate from the passenger travel component in addition the change fees which were previously recognized when received will likely be recognized when transportation is provided the company is evaluating other impacts on its consolidated financial statements 

frequent flyer accounting the company’s mileageplus program is designed to increase customer loyalty program participants earn miles by flying on united and certain other participating airlines program participants can also earn miles through purchases from other nonairline partners that participate in the company’s loyalty program we sell miles to these partners which include credit card issuers retail merchants hotels car rental companies and our participating airline partners miles can be redeemed for free other than taxes and government imposed fees discounted or upgraded air travel and nontravel awards the company records its obligation for future award redemptions using a deferred revenue model 

in the case of the sale of air services the company recognizes a portion of the ticket sales as revenue when the air transportation occurs and defers a portion of the ticket sale representing the value of the related miles as a multipledeliverable revenue arrangement the miles are recorded in frequent flyer deferred revenue on the company’s consolidated balance sheet and recognized into revenue when the transportation is provided 

the company determines the estimated selling price of air transportation and miles as if each element is sold on a separate basis the total consideration from each ticket sale is then allocated to each of these elements individually on a pro rata basis 

the company’s estimated selling price of miles is based on an equivalent ticket value less fulfillment discount which incorporates the expected redemption of miles as the best estimate of selling price for these miles the equivalent ticket value is based on the prior 12 months’ weighted average equivalent ticket value of similar fares as those used to settle award redemptions while taking into consideration such factors as redemption pattern cabin class loyalty status and geographic region the estimated selling price of miles is adjusted by a fulfillment discount that considers a number of factors including redemption patterns of various customer groups 

united has a significant contract to sell mileageplus miles to its cobranded credit card partner chase united identified the following significant revenue elements in the cobrand agreement the air transportation element represented by the value of the mile generally resulting from its redemption for future air transportation and whose fair value is described above use of the united brand and access to mileageplus member lists advertising and other travel related benefits 

the fair value of the elements is determined using management’s estimated selling price of each element the objective of using the estimated selling price based methodology is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis accordingly we determine our best estimate of selling price by considering multiple inputs and methods including but not limited to discounted cash flows brand value volume discounts published selling prices number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed the company estimated the selling prices and volumes over the term of the cobrand agreement in order to determine the allocation of proceeds to each of the multiple elements to be delivered we also evaluate volumes on an annual basis which may result in a change in the allocation of estimated selling price on a prospective basis 

  

the company records passenger revenue related to the air transportation element when the transportation is delivered the other elements are generally recognized as other operating revenue when earned 

the company accounts for miles sold and awarded that will never be redeemed by program members which we refer to as breakage the company reviews its breakage estimates annually based upon the latest available information regarding redemption and expiration patterns miles expire after 18 months of member account inactivity the company’s estimate of the expected expiration of miles requires significant management judgment current and future changes to expiration assumptions or to the expiration policy or to program rules and program redemption opportunities may result in material changes to the deferred revenue balance as well as recognized revenues from the programs 

the following table summarizes information related to the company’s frequent flyer deferred revenue liability 

 

 effective march 1 2015 the company modified its mileageplus program for most tickets from a model in which members earned redeemable miles based on distance traveled to one based on ticket price including base fare and carrier imposed surcharges members now earn between five and eleven miles per dollar spent based on their mileageplus status the updated program enhances the rewards for customers who spend more with united and gives them improved mileageearning opportunities this modification had no material impact to the frequent flyer deferred revenue on the company’s consolidated balance sheet 

longlived assets the net book value of operating property and equipment for the company was 22 billion and 19 billion at december 31 2015 and december 31 2014 respectively the assets’ recorded value is impacted by a number of accounting policy elections including the estimation of useful lives and residual values and when necessary the recognition of asset impairment charges 

the company records assets acquired including aircraft at acquisition cost depreciable life is determined through economic analysis such as reviewing existing fleet plans obtaining appraisals and comparing estimated lives to other airlines that operate similar fleets as aircraft technology has improved useful life has increased and the company has generally estimated the lives of those aircraft to be 30 years residual values are estimated based on historical experience with regard to the sale of both aircraft and spare parts and are established in conjunction with the estimated useful lives of the related fleets residual values are based on when the aircraft are acquired and typically reflect asset values that have not reached the end of their physical life both depreciable lives and residual values are revised periodically as facts and circumstances arise to recognize changes in the company’s fleet plan and other relevant information a oneyear increase in the average depreciable life of the company’s flight equipment would reduce annual depreciation expense on flight equipment by approximately 50 million 

the company evaluates the carrying value of longlived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist for purposes of this testing the company has generally identified the aircraft fleet type as the lowest level of identifiable cash flows for purposes of testing aircraft for impairment an impairment charge is recognized when the asset’s carrying value exceeds its net undiscounted future cash flows and its fair market value the amount of the charge is the difference between the asset’s carrying value and fair market value 

defined benefit plan accounting we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees the most critical assumptions impacting our defined benefit pension plan obligations and expenses are the weighted average discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on the plan assets 

united’s pension plans’ underfunded status was 15 billion at december 31 2015 funding requirements for taxqualified defined benefit pension plans are determined by government regulations in 2016 we anticipate contributing at least 400 million to our pension plans the fair value of the plans’ assets was 30 billion at december 31 2015 

  

when calculating pension expense for 2016 the company assumed that its plans’ assets would generate a longterm rate of return of approximately 70 the expected longterm rate of return assumption was developed based on historical experience and input from the trustee managing the plans’ assets the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of assets which is based on a goal of earning the highest rate of return while maintaining risk at acceptable levels our projected longterm rate of return reflects the active management of our plans’ assets the plans strive to have assets sufficiently diversified so that adverse or unexpected results from one security class will not have an unduly detrimental impact on the entire portfolio plan fiduciaries regularly review actual asset allocation and the pension plans’ investments are periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 

the defined benefit pension plans’ assets consist of return generating investments and risk mitigating investments which are held through direct ownership or through interests in common collective trusts return generating investments include primarily equity securities fixedincome securities and alternative investments eg private equity and hedge funds risk mitigating investments include primarily us government and investment grade corporate fixedincome securities the allocation of assets was as follows at december 31 2015 

 

 pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases lowering the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets by 50 basis points from 70 to 65 would increase estimated 2016 pension expense by approximately 15 million 

future pension obligations for united’s plans were discounted using a weighted average rate of 458 at december 31 2015 the company selected the discount rate for substantially all of its plans by using a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds at december 31 2015 that would provide the necessary cash flows to match the projected benefit payments 

the pension liability and future pension expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points from 458 to 408 would increase the pension liability at december 31 2015 by approximately 477 million and increase the estimated 2016 pension expense by approximately 55 million 

future changes in plan asset returns plan provisions assumed discount rates pension funding law and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future 

actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions under the applicable accounting standards for defined benefit pension plans those gains and losses are not required to be recognized currently as pension benefit expense but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into expense over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees all gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are amortized to expense over the remaining years of service of the covered active employees at december 31 2015 and 2014 the company had unrecognized actuarial losses for pension benefit plans of 844 million and 982 million respectively recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 

other postretirement benefit plan accounting united’s postretirement plan provides certain health care benefits primarily in the united states to retirees and eligible dependents as well as certain life insurance 

  

benefits to certain retirees reflected as “other benefits” united also has retiree medical programs that permit retirees who meet certain age and service requirements to continue medical coverage between retirement and medicare eligibility eligible employees are required to pay a portion of the costs of their retiree medical benefits which in some cases may be offset by accumulated unused sick time at the time of their retirement plan benefits are subject to copayments deductibles and other limits as described in the plans 

the company accounts for other postretirement benefits by recognizing the difference between plan assets and obligations or the plan’s funded status in its financial statements other postretirement benefit expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees’ approximate service periods and is generally calculated independently of funding decisions or requirements united has not been required to prefund its plan obligations which has resulted in a significant net obligation as discussed below the company’s benefit obligation was 20 billion and 21 billion for the other postretirement benefit plans at december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively 

the calculation of other postretirement benefit expense and obligations requires the use of a number of assumptions including the assumed discount rate for measuring future payment obligations and the health care cost trend rate the company determines the appropriate discount rate for each of the plans based on current rates on high quality corporate bonds that would generate the cash flow necessary to pay plan benefits when due the company’s weighted average discount rate to determine its benefit obligations as of december 31 2015 was 449 as compared to 407 for december 31 2014 the health care cost trend rate assumed for 2015 was 700 declining to 50 in 2023 as compared to assumed trend rate for 2016 of 675 declining to 50 in 2023 a 1 increase in assumed health care trend rates would increase the company’s total service and interest cost for the year ended december 31 2015 by 13 million whereas a 1 decrease in assumed health care trend rates would decrease the company’s total service and interest cost for the year ended december 31 2015 by 11 million a one percentage point decrease in the weighted average discount rate would increase the company’s postretirement benefit liability by approximately 227 million and increase the estimated 2015 benefits expense by approximately 12 million 

actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions and prior service credits result from a retroactive reduction in benefits due under the plans under the applicable accounting standards for postretirement welfare benefit plans actuarial gains and losses and prior service credits are not required to be recognized currently but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into expense over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees or the average life expectancy of inactive participants at december 31 2015 and 2014 the company had unrecognized actuarial gains for postretirement welfare benefit plans of 236 million and 233 million respectively recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 

income taxes the company’s income tax benefit was 31 billion for the year ended december 31 2015 a discrete tax benefit of 31 billion for the reduction to the us net federal and state deferred tax asset valuation allowance was included in the income tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2015 

during 2015 after considering all positive and negative evidence and the four sources of taxable income the company concluded that its deferred income tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in evaluating the likelihood of utilizing the company’s net federal and state deferred tax assets the significant relevant factors that the company considered are 1 its recent history and forecasted profitability 2 growth in the us and global economies and 3 future impact of taxable temporary differences although the company was not in a threeyear cumulative loss position at december 31 2014 management concluded that the low level of cumulative pretax income coupled with the company’s history of operating losses resulted in a determination that a valuation allowance was still necessary we considered past profitability and future expectations of profitability to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our net deferred tax assets management placed significant weight on past performance ie losses or near breakeven results in 2009 to 2013 as it is more objectively verifiable than projections of future taxable income however during 2015 the company’s pretax profit of 42 billion benefited from lower oil prices and improved efficiency that resulted in significant taxable income additionally based upon current projection of future 

  

earnings the company evaluated the nols expiration periods and change in ownership limitations under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended and determined the nols would be realized before expiring beginning in 2025 therefore the company released almost all of its valuation allowance in 2015 resulting in a 31 billion benefit in its provision for income taxes the valuation allowance recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss “aoci” in prior years was released through the income statement and resulted in remaining debits within aoci of 285 million and 180 million related to pension and derivatives respectively which will not be recognized into income tax expense until either the plans are exited or the company no longer has any outstanding derivatives 

the company has retained a valuation allowance of 48 million against certain state and local nols and credit carryforwards at the end of 2015 the company expects these nols and credits will expire unused due to limited carryforward periods the ability to utilize these state nols and credits will be evaluated on a quarterly basis to determine if there are any significant events or any prudent and feasible tax planning strategies that would affect the company’s ability to realize these deferred tax assets 

the company has a net deferred tax asset totaling 20 billion as of december 31 2015 that relates primarily to its federal and state nol carryforwards the federal and state nol carryforwards relate to prior years’ nols which may be used to reduce tax liabilities in future years these tax benefits are mostly attributable to federal pretax nol carryforwards of 80 billion for ual if not utilized these federal pretax nols will expire as follows in billions 21 in 2025 20 in 2026 14 in 2027 and 25 after 2028 in addition the majority of tax benefits of the state net operating losses of 103 million for ual will expire over a five to 20year period additionally the company has 232 million of alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards which do not expire

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend interest rates our net income loss is affected by fluctuations in interest rates eg interest expense on variable rate debt and interest income earned on shortterm investments the company’s policy is to manage interest rate risk through a combination of fixed and variable rate debt the following table summarizes information related to the company’s interest rate market risk at december 31 in millions 

 

 a 2014 amount differs from the amount reported in the company’s form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2014 due to the adoption of an accounting standard update in 2015 see note 1t to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information 

a change in market interest rates would also impact interest income earned on our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments assuming our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments remain at their average 2015 levels a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a corresponding increase in the company’s interest income of approximately 54 million during 2016 

commodity price risk aircraft fuel the price level of aircraft fuel can significantly affect the company’s operations results of operations financial position and liquidity 

to protect against increases in the prices of aircraft fuel the company may hedge a portion of its future fuel requirements the company may restructure hedges in response to market conditions prior to their original settlement dates which may result in changes in hedge coverage levels and the potential recognition of gains or losses on such hedge contracts the company generally uses financial hedge instruments including fixedprice swaps purchased call options and commonly used combinations using put and call options including collars a sold put option combined with a purchased call option threeways a collar with a higher strike sold call option and fourway collars a collar with a higher strike sold call option and a lower strike purchased put option these hedge instruments are generally based on aircraft fuel or closely related commodities including diesel fuel and crude oil 

  

if the prices of the underlying commodity drop and stay below specified floor prices in some hedge contracts such as fixedprice swaps and collars the company may incur losses however the negative impact of these losses would be significantly outweighed by the benefit of lower aircraft fuel cost since the company typically hedges only a portion of its future fuel requirements in addition the company continually monitors its portfolio of hedge contracts and may take actions to curtail or limit its losses from such hedge contracts if market conditions change 

if fuel prices decline significantly from the levels existing at the time we enter into a hedge contract we may be required to post collateral margin with our hedge counterparties the company frequently monitors this margin risk and assesses the potential of depositing additional collateral with each of its counterparties at times when the fair market value of the company’s hedge contracts is net positive to the company it is exposed to the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to the hedge contract the company periodically monitors the credit worthiness of its counterparties requires its counterparties to post collateral above certain thresholds and generally limits its exposure to any single counterparty 

the company may adjust its hedging program based on changes in market conditions the following table summarizes information related to the company’s cost of fuel and hedging in millions except percentages 

 

  

a includes related taxes and fuel hedge impacts and excludes special charges in 2014 the company’s fuel cost was 32 of total operating expenses 

b based on 2016 projected fuel consumption does not include the impact of fuel hedges 

c as of december 31 2014 the net fair value of the company’s fuel hedges was a liability of 717 million 

d based on fuel hedge positions at december 31 2015 

e assumes instantaneous change in prices 

as of december 31 2015 the company had hedged approximately 17 of its projected fuel requirements 652 million gallons for 2016 with commonly used financial hedge instruments based on aircraft fuel or crude oil as of december 31 2015 the company had fuel hedges expiring through december 2016 

  

the fuel hedge portfolio is comprised of many individual hedge contracts primarily option contracts on multiple underlying commodities and entered into at various points in time resulting in a wide range of strike prices with several hedge counterparties the table below provides a view of the economic impact of the hedge portfolio on the company’s 2016 fuel costs given significant moves up to 30 in market fuel prices from december 31 2015 in millions 

 

 foreign currency the company generates revenues and incurs expenses in numerous foreign currencies changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the company’s results of operations through changes in the dollar value of foreign currencydenominated operating revenues and expenses some of the company’s more significant foreign currency exposures include the canadian dollar chinese renminbi european euro british pound and japanese yen at times the company uses derivative financial instruments such as options collars and forward contracts to hedge its exposure to foreign currency at december 31 2015 the company had foreign currency derivative contracts in place to hedge european euro denominated sales the notional amount of the hedges equates to 18 of the company’s projected european euro denominated net cash inflows for 2016 net cash relates primarily to passenger ticket sales inflows partially offset by expenses paid in local currencies at december 31 2015 the fair value of the company’s foreign currency derivatives was not material to the company’s financial statements 

the result of a uniform 10 percent strengthening in the value of the us dollar from december 31 2015 levels relative to each of the currencies in which the company has foreign currency exposure would result in a decrease in pretax income of approximately 236 million for the year ending december 31 2016 this sensitivity analysis was prepared based upon projected 2016 foreign currencydenominated revenues and expenses as of december 31 2015 and reflects the potential benefit of the european euro hedges mentioned above

operations 

network the company transports people and cargo through its mainline operations which use jet aircraft with at least 118 seats and its regional operations see part i item 2 properties for a description of the company’s mainline and regional aircraft 

with key global air rights in north america asiapacific europe middle east africa and latin america ual has the world’s most comprehensive global route network ual through united and its regional carriers operates an average of 5055 flights a day to 373 airports across six continents from the company’s hubs at newark liberty international airport “newark liberty” chicago o’hare international airport “chicago 

  

o’hare” denver international airport “denver” george bush intercontinental airport “houston bush” los angeles international airport “lax” ab won pat international airport “guam” san francisco international airport “sfo” and washington dulles international airport “washington dulles” 

all of the company’s domestic hubs are located in large business and population centers contributing to a large amount of “origin and destination” traffic the hub and spoke system allows us to transport passengers between a large number of destinations with substantially more frequent service than if each route were served directly the hub system also allows us to add service to a new destination from a large number of cities using only one or a limited number of aircraft as discussed under alliances below united is a member of star alliance the world’s largest alliance network 

financial information on the company’s operating revenues by geographic regions as reported to the us department of transportation the “dot” can be found in note 18 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

regional the company has contractual relationships with various regional carriers to provide regional jet and turboprop service branded as united express these regional operations are an extension of the company’s mainline network this regional service complements our operations by carrying traffic that connects to our mainline service and allows flights to smaller cities that cannot be provided economically with mainline aircraft republic airlines “republic” commutair airlines “commutair” expressjet airlines “expressjet” gojet airlines “gojet” mesa airlines “mesa” shuttle america “shuttle” skywest airlines “skywest” and trans states airlines “trans states” are all regional carriers which operate most of their capacity contracted to united under capacity purchase agreements “cpas” with united under these cpas the company pays the regional carriers contractuallyagreed fees carriercontrolled costs for operating these flights plus a variable reimbursement incentive payment for operational performance based on agreed performance metrics the fees for carriercontrolled costs are based on specific rates for various operating expenses of the regional carriers such as crew expenses maintenance and aircraft ownership some of which are multiplied by specific operating statistics eg block hours departures while others are fixed monthly amounts under these cpas the company is responsible for all fuel costs incurred as well as landing fees facilities rent and other costs which are passed through by the regional carrier to the company without any markup in return the regional carriers operate this capacity exclusively for united on schedules determined by the company the company also determines pricing and revenue management assumes the inventory and distribution risk for the available seats and permits mileage accrual and redemption for regional flights through its mileageplus loyalty program 

while the regional carriers operating under cpas comprise more than 95 of all regional flights the company also has prorate agreements with hyannis air service inc “cape air” skywest and trans states under these commercial flying agreements the company and its regional carriers agree to divide revenue collected from each passenger according to a formula while both the company and its regional carriers are individually responsible for their own costs of operations unlike cpas under a prorate agreement the regional carrier retains the control and risk of scheduling and in most cases market selection local seat pricing and inventory for its flights although the company and its regional carriers may coordinate schedules to maximize connections 

alliances united has a number of strategic bilateral and multilateral alliances with other airlines including marketing alliances and joint ventures which enhance travel options for customers by providing greater time of day coverage to common destinations additional mileage accrual and redemption opportunities and expanded global network access these marketing alliances typically include one or more of the following features loyalty program reciprocity codesharing of flight operations whereby one carrier’s selected flights can be marketed under the brand name of another carrier coordination of reservations ticketing passenger checkin baggage handling airport lounge access and flight schedules and other resourcesharing activities that include joint sales and marketing 

united is a member of star alliance a global integrated airline network cofounded by united in 1997 and the largest and most comprehensive airline alliance in the world as of january 1 2015 star alliance carriers served over 1300 airports in more than 190 countries with over 18500 daily departures current star alliance members in addition to united are adria airways aegean airlines air canada air china air india air new zealand 

  

all nippon airways “ana” asiana airlines austrian airlines avianca brussels airlines copa airlines croatia airlines egyptair ethiopian airlines eva air lot polish airlines lufthansa sas scandinavian airlines shenzhen airlines singapore airlines south african airways swiss tap portugal thai airways international and turkish airlines 

united has a variety of bilateral commercial alliance agreements and obligations with star alliance members addressing among other things reciprocal earning redemption of frequent flyer miles and access to airport lounges and with certain star alliance members codesharing of flight operations in addition to the alliance agreements with star alliance members united currently maintains independent marketing alliance agreements with other air carriers currently unaffiliated with a global alliance including aeromar aer lingus air dolomiti cape air germanwings great lakes airlines hawaiian airlines island air jet airways and silver airways united also offers a traintoplane codeshare and frequent flyer alliance with amtrak from newark liberty on select city pairs in the northeastern united states 

united also participates in joint ventures one with air canada and the lufthansa group which includes lufthansa and its affiliates austrian airlines brussels airlines and swiss covering transatlantic routes and another with ana covering certain transpacific routes these joint ventures enable the participating carriers to integrate the services they provide in the respective regions capturing revenue synergies and delivering highly competitive flight schedules fares and services 

loyalty program united’s mileageplus program builds customer loyalty by offering awards and services to program participants members in this program earn mileage credit for flights on united united express airlines in star alliance and certain other airlines that participate in the program members can also earn miles by purchasing the goods and services of our network of nonairline partners such as credit card issuers retail merchants hotels and car rental companies members can redeem mileage credits for free other than taxes and government imposed fees discounted or upgraded travel and nontravel awards 

under the company’s consolidated amended and restated cobranded card marketing services agreement the “cobrand agreement” with chase bank usa na “chase” loyalty program members accrue mileageplus miles for making purchases using cobranded credit cards issued by chase the cobrand agreement provides for joint marketing of the company’s credit card program and provides chase with other benefits such as permission to market to the company’s customer database 

approximately 48 million and 50 million mileageplus flight awards were used on united in 2014 and 2013 respectively these awards represented 71 and 77 of united’s total revenue passenger miles in 2014 and 2013 respectively total miles redeemed for flights on united in 2014 including classofservice upgrades represented approximately 77 of the total miles redeemed 

in addition excluding miles redeemed for flights on united mileageplus members redeemed miles for approximately 175 million other awards in 2014 as compared to two million in 2013 these awards include united club memberships car and hotel awards merchandise and flights on other air carriers 

fuel aircraft fuel has been the company’s single largest operating expense for the last several years the table below summarizes ual’s aircraft fuel consumption and expense during the last three years 

 

  

a calculation excludes special charges identified in note 17 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

  

the availability and price of aircraft fuel significantly affect the company’s operations results of operations financial position and liquidity to provide adequate supplies of fuel the company routinely enters into shortterm and longterm purchase contracts and has some ability to store fuel close to its major hub locations to protect against increases in the prices of aircraft fuel the company routinely hedges a portion of its future fuel requirements the company generally uses commonly used financial hedge instruments based on aircraft fuel or closely related commodities including diesel fuel and crude oil 

thirdparty business united generates thirdparty business revenue that includes fuel sales catering ground handling maintenance services and frequent flyer award nonair redemptions and thirdparty business revenue is recorded in other operating revenue united also incurs thirdparty business expenses such as maintenance ground handling and catering services for third parties fuel sales and nonair mileage redemptions and those thirdparty business expenses are recorded in other operating expenses 

distribution channels the company’s airline seat inventory is distributed through the company’s direct channels traditional travel agencies and online travel agencies agency sales are primarily sold using global distribution systems “gds” united has developed capability to sell certain ancillary products through the gds channel to reach customers who purchase in that channel the use of the company’s direct sales website unitedcom the company’s mobile applications and alternative distribution systems provides the company with an opportunity to decommoditize its services better control its content make more targeted offerings better retain its customers enhance its brand and lower its ticket distribution costs to encourage customer use of lowercost channels and capitalize on these costsaving opportunities the company will continue to expand the capabilities of its website and mobile applications and explore alternative distribution channels 

industry conditions 

domestic competition the domestic airline industry is highly competitive and dynamic currently any us carrier deemed fit by the dot is free to operate scheduled passenger service between any two points within the united states the company’s competitors consist primarily of other airlines and to a lesser extent other forms of transportation competition can be direct in the form of another carrier flying the exact nonstop route or indirect where a carrier serves the same two cities nonstop from an alternative airport in that city or via an itinerary requiring a connection at another airport air carriers’ cost structures are not uniform and there are numerous factors influencing cost structure carriers with lower costs may offer lower fares to passengers which could have a potential negative impact on the company’s revenues decisions on domestic pricing are based on intense competitive pressure exerted on the company by other us airlines in order to remain competitive and maintain passenger traffic levels we often find it necessary to match competitors’ discounted fares since we compete in a dynamic marketplace attempts to generate additional revenue through increased fares oftentimes fail 

international competition internationally the company competes not only with us airlines but also with foreign carriers international competition has increased and may increase in the future as a result of airline mergers and acquisitions joint ventures alliances restructurings liberalization of aviation bilateral agreements and new or increased service by competitors competition on international routes is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation the company’s ability to compete successfully with nonus carriers on international routes depends in part on its ability to generate traffic to and from the entire united states via its integrated domestic route network and its ability to overcome business and operational challenges across its network worldwide foreign carriers currently are prohibited by us law from carrying local passengers between two points in the united states and the company experiences comparable restrictions in foreign countries except where “fifth freedom rights” have been negotiated between the us government and other countries in addition in the absence of open skies and fifth freedom rights us carriers are constrained from carrying passengers to points beyond designated international gateway cities due to limitations in air service agreements and restrictions imposed unilaterally by foreign governments to compensate partially for these structural limitations us and foreign carriers have entered into alliances joint ventures and marketing arrangements that enable these carriers to exchange traffic between each other’s flights and route networks see alliances above for additional information 

  

seasonality the air travel business is subject to seasonal fluctuations historically demand for air travel is higher in the second and third quarters driving higher revenues than in the first and fourth quarters which are periods of lower travel demand 

industry regulation 

domestic regulation 

general all carriers engaged in air transportation in the united states are subject to regulation by the dot absent an exemption no air carrier may provide air transportation of passengers or property without first being issued a dot certificate of public convenience and necessity the dot also grants international route authority approves international codeshare arrangements and regulates methods of competition the dot regulates consumer protection and maintains jurisdiction over advertising denied boarding compensation tarmac delays baggage liability and other areas and may add additional expensive regulatory burdens in the future the dot’s series of rules to enhance airline passenger protections have required us air carriers to adopt contingency plans and procedures for tarmac delays exceeding three hours for domestic flights and four hours for international flights and to charge the same baggage fee throughout a passenger’s entire itinerary even if on multiple carriers in may 2014 the dot issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to regulate the disclosure of air carrier’s ancillary fees and other consumer protection issues 

airlines are also regulated by the federal aviation administration the “faa” an agency within the dot primarily in the areas of flight safety air carrier operations and aircraft maintenance and airworthiness the faa issues air carrier operating certificates and aircraft airworthiness certificates prescribes maintenance procedures oversees airport operations and regulates pilot and other employee training the 2011 faa final rule amending existing flight duty and rest regulations applicable to us air carriers under part 117 of the federal aviation regulations which took effect on january 4 2014 mandates extensive changes to the way the company schedules crews and deploys aircraft from time to time the faa issues directives that require air carriers to inspect or modify aircraft and other equipment potentially causing the company to incur substantial unplanned expenses the airline industry is also subject to numerous other federal laws and regulations the us department of homeland security “dhs” has jurisdiction over virtually every aspect of civil aviation security in march 2014 the occupational safety and health administration “osha” extended its regulatory programs for hazard communication hearing conservation and bloodborne pathogens to areas of cabin crewmember safety and health the antitrust division of the us department of justice “doj” has jurisdiction over certain airline competition matters the us postal service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail by airlines labor relations in the airline industry are generally governed by the railway labor act “rla” a federal statute the company is also subject to investigation inquiries by the dot faa doj dhs and other us and international regulatory bodies 

airport access access to landing and takeoff rights or “slots” at several major us airports and many foreign airports served by the company are or recently have been subject to government regulation federally mandated domestic slot restrictions currently apply at reagan national airport in washington dc and at john f kennedy international airport “jfk” laguardia airport “laguardia” and newark liberty in the metropolitan new york region in addition to address concerns about airport congestion the faa has imposed operating restrictions at certain airports including newark liberty jfk and laguardia which may include capacity reductions additional restrictions on airline routes and takeoff and landing slots at these and other airports may be proposed in the future that could affect the company’s rights of ownership and transfer 

legislation the airline industry is subject to legislative activity that may have an impact on operations and costs in 2015 the us congress will begin consideration of legislation to reauthorize the faa which encompasses all significant aviation tax and policy related issues as with previous reauthorization legislation the us congress may consider a range of policy changes that could impact operations and costs climate change legislation is also likely to be a significant area of legislative and regulatory focus and could adversely impact the company’s costs see environmental regulation  below 

  

finally aviation security continues to be the subject of legislative and regulatory action requiring changes to the company’s security processes increasing the cost of its security procedures and affecting its operations 

international regulation 

general international air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation in connection with the company’s international services the company is regulated by both the us government and the governments of the foreign countries the company serves in addition the availability of international routes to us carriers is regulated by aviation agreements between the us and foreign governments and in some cases fares and schedules require the approval of the dot andor the relevant foreign governments 

legislation foreign countries are increasingly enacting passenger protection laws rules and regulations that meet or exceed us requirements in cases where this activity exceeds us requirements additional burden and liability may be placed on the company certain countries have regulations requiring passenger compensation andor enforcement penalties from the company in addition to changes in operating procedures due to canceled and delayed flights 

airport access historically access to foreign markets has been tightly controlled through bilateral agreements between the us and each foreign country involved these agreements regulate the markets served the number of carriers allowed to serve each market and the frequency of carriers’ flights since the early 1990s the us has pursued a policy of “open skies” meaning all usflag carriers have access to the destination under which the us government has negotiated a number of bilateral agreements allowing unrestricted access between us and foreign markets currently there are more than 100 open skies agreements in effect however many of the airports that the company serves in europe asia and latin america maintain slot controls a large number of these are restrictive due to congestion at these airports london heathrow international airport frankfurt rheinmain airport shanghai pudong international airport beijing capital international airport sao paulo guarulhos international airport and tokyo haneda international airport are among the most restrictive foreign airports due to capacity limitations 

the company’s ability to serve some foreign markets and expand into certain others is limited by the absence of aviation agreements between the us government and the relevant foreign governments shifts in us or foreign government aviation policies may lead to the alteration or termination of air service agreements depending on the nature of any such change the value of the company’s international route authorities and slot rights may be materially enhanced or diminished 

environmental regulation 

general the airline industry is subject to increasingly stringent federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations concerning emissions to the air discharges to surface and subsurface waters safe drinking water aircraft noise and the management of hazardous substances oils and waste materials areas of either proposed regulations or implementation of new regulations include regulations surrounding climate change discussed further below state of california regulations regarding air emissions from ground support equipment regulations limiting the use of certain chemicals and a federal rulemaking seeking to regulate airport fuel hydrant systems under the underground storage tank regulations 

climate change there are certain laws and regulations relating to climate change that apply to the company including the european union’s emissions trading scheme “eu ets” environmental taxes for certain international flights including germany’s departure ticket tax greenhouse gas reporting requirements and the state of california’s greenhouse gas cap and trade regulations that impact united’s san francisco maintenance center in addition there are landuse planning laws that could apply to airport expansion projects requiring a review of carbon emissions these laws could affect airlines in certain circumstances 

the 2009 european union “eu” directive to include aviation carbon emissions from flights to and from the eu in the eu ets has been the subject of significant international dispute among countries including the united 

  

states in april 2013 to give the international civil aviation organization “icao” an opportunity to reach international agreement the eu approved a one year stay such that the requirements of the eu ets would apply only to intraeu flights and in april 2014 this stay was further extended to 2016 

the icao adopted a resolution establishing the path for development of a global marketbasedmeasure to regulate international aviation carbon emissions for final approval by icao in 2016 and the work has progressed during 2014 in developing this regulatory scheme the cost to the company of such a global measure is not known at this time as there are many variables under consideration the company is taking various actions to reduce its carbon emissions through fleet renewal aircraft retrofits and actions seeking to stimulate the commercialization of aviation alternative fuels 

other environmental matters some us and foreign airports have established airport restrictions to limit noise including restrictions on aircraft types and operating times in some instances these restrictions have caused curtailments in services or increased operating costs and could limit our ability to expand our operations at the affected airports in addition some foreign airports andor governments either have established or are seeking to establish environmental fees applicable to carbon emissions local air quality pollutants andor noise the company is engaged in a number of geographic locations where changes to existing noise and emissions policies are being considered 

the airline industry is also subject to other federal state and local environmental laws and regulations that require the company to remediate soil or groundwater to meet certain objectives and which may require significant expenditures under such environmental cleanup laws generators of waste materials and owners or operators of facilities can be subject to liability for investigation and remediation costs at locations that have been identified as requiring response actions the company also conducts voluntary environmental assessment and remediation actions environmental cleanup obligations can arise from among other circumstances the operation of aircraft fueling facilities which primarily involve airport sites future costs associated with these activities are currently not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

employees 

as of december 31 2014 ual including its subsidiaries had approximately 84000 employees approximately 80 of the company’s employees were represented by various us labor organizations as of december 31 2014 

collective bargaining agreements between the company and its represented employee groups are negotiated under the rla such agreements typically do not contain an expiration date and instead specify an amendable date upon which the contract is considered “open for amendment” the company continues to integrate its remaining employee groups in connection with the company’s merger transaction in 2010 such process being governed by a combination of the rla the mccaskillbond amendment and where applicable the existing provisions of united’s collective bargaining agreements and union policies 

  

the following table reflects the company’s represented employee groups number of employees per represented group union representation for each of united’s employee groups where applicable amendable date for each employee group’s collective bargaining agreement and whether the group is engaged in negotiations for a joint collective bargaining agreement 

 

  

a the table includes the company’s us based and guam union represented employees only 

b the respective amendable dates for those joint negotiations in progress reflect the remaining united continental andor continental micronesia inc standalone agreements 

the company cannot predict the outcome of negotiations with its unionized employee groups although significant increases in the pay and benefits resulting from new collective bargaining agreements would have an adverse financial impact on the company see notes 15 and 17 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information on labor negotiations and costs 

  

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend the following risk factors should be read carefully when evaluating the company’s business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this report and other statements the company or its representatives make from time to time any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect the company’s business operating results financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this report 

high andor volatile fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a material adverse impact on the company’s strategic plans operating results financial position and liquidity 

aircraft fuel is critical to the company’s operations and has been the company’s single largest and most volatile operating expense for the last several years the company generally sources adequate supplies of fuel at prevailing market prices and has some ability to store fuel close to major hub locations to ensure supply continuity in the short term timely and adequate supply of aircraft fuel depends on the continued availability of reliable fuel supply sources and delivery infrastructure although the company has some ability to cover short term supply and infrastructure disruptions at its major demand locations it can neither predict nor guarantee the continued timely availability of aircraft fuel throughout the company’s system 

market prices for aircraft fuel depend on a multitude of unpredictable factors beyond the company’s control these factors include changes in global crude oil prices aircraft fuel supplydemand balance inventory levels and fuel production and transportation capacity as well as indirect factors such as geopolitical events economic growth indicators fiscalmonetary policies fuel tax policies and financial investments both actual changes as well as changes in market expectations of these factors can potentially drive rapid changes in fuel price levels and price volatility 

given the highly competitive nature of the airline industry the company may not be able to increase its fares and fees sufficiently to offset the full impact of increases in fuel prices especially if these increases are rapid and sustained further such fare and fee increases may not be sustainable may reduce the general demand for air travel and may also eventually impact the company’s strategic growth and investment plans for the future in addition decreases in fuel prices for an extended period may result in increased industry capacity increased competitive actions for market share and lower fares or surcharges in general if fuel prices were subsequently to rise significantly there may be a lag between improvement of revenue and the adverse impact of higher fuel prices as a result of any increased industry capacity 

to protect against increases in the market prices of fuel the company routinely hedges a portion of its future fuel requirements however the company’s hedging program may not be successful in mitigating higher fuel costs and any price protection provided may be limited due to market conditions including choice of hedging instruments breakdown of correlation between hedging instrument and market price of fuel and failure of hedge counterparties to the extent that the company uses hedge contracts that have the potential to create an obligation to pay upon settlement if fuel prices decline significantly including swaps or sold put options as part of a collar such hedge contracts may limit the company’s ability to benefit fully from lower fuel costs in the future if fuel prices decline significantly from the levels existing at the time the company enters into a hedge contract the company may be required to post collateral margin beyond certain thresholds there can be no assurance that the company’s hedging arrangements will provide any particular level of protection against rises in fuel prices or that its counterparties will be able to perform under the company’s hedging arrangements additionally deterioration in the company’s financial condition could negatively affect its ability to enter into new hedge contracts in the future and may potentially require the company to post increased amounts of collateral under its fuel hedging agreements 

in addition the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 and regulations promulgated by the commodity futures trading commission the “cftc” require centralized clearing for overthecounter derivatives and recordkeeping and reporting requirements that are applicable to the company’s fuel hedge contracts the ual board of directors “board of directors” has approved the company’s election of the 

  

cftc’s enduser exception which permits the company as a nonfinancial end user of derivatives to hedge commercial risk and be exempt from the cftc mandatory clearing requirements however several of the company’s hedge counterparties are also subject to these requirements which may raise the counterparties’ costs those increased costs may in turn be passed on to the company resulting in increased transaction costs to execute hedge contracts and lower credit thresholds to post collateral margin 

see note 10 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information on the company’s hedging programs 

terrorist attacks or international hostilities or the fear of terrorist attacks or hostilities even if not made directly on the airline industry could negatively affect the company and the airline industry 

the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 involving commercial aircraft severely and adversely impacted the company’s financial condition and results of operations as well as the prospects for the airline industry among the effects experienced from the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks were substantial flight disruption costs caused by the faaimposed temporary grounding of the us airline industry’s fleet significantly increased security costs and associated passenger inconvenience increased insurance costs substantially higher ticket refunds and significantly decreased traffic and passenger revenue 

additional terrorist attacks even if not made directly on the airline industry or the fear of or the precautions taken in anticipation of such attacks including elevated national threat warnings or selective cancellation or redirection of flights could materially and adversely affect the company and the airline industry wars and other international hostilities could also have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition liquidity and results of operations the company’s financial resources may not be sufficient to absorb the adverse effects of any future terrorist attacks or other international hostilities 

the company relies heavily on technology and automated systems to operate its business and any significant failure or disruption of the technology or these systems could materially harm its business 

the company depends on automated systems and technology to operate its business including computerized airline reservation systems flight operations systems revenue management systems accounting systems telecommunication systems and commercial websites including wwwunitedcom united’s website and other automated systems must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic maintain secure information and deliver important flight and schedule information as well as process critical financial transactions these systems could suffer substantial or repeated disruptions due to various events some of which are beyond the company’s control including natural disasters power failures terrorist attacks equipment or software failures computer viruses or cyber security attacks substantial or repeated systems failures or disruptions including failures or disruptions related to the company’s complex integration of systems could reduce the attractiveness of the company’s services versus those of its competitors materially impair its ability to market its services and operate its flights result in the unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information result in increased costs lost revenue and the loss or compromise of important data and may adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

disruptions to the company’s regional network and united express flights provided by thirdparty regional carriers could adversely affect the company’s operations and financial condition 

the company has contractual relationships with various regional carriers to provide regional jet and turboprop service branded as united express these regional operations are an extension of the company’s mainline network and complement the company’s operations by carrying traffic that connects to mainline service and allows flights to smaller cities that cannot be provided economically with mainline aircraft the company’s business and operations are dependent on its regional flight network with regional capacity accounting for approximately 13 of the company’s total as of december 31 2014 

although the company has agreements with its regional carriers that include contractually agreed performance metrics the company does not control the operations of these carriers a number of factors may impact the 

  

company’s regional network including weatherrelated effects and seasonality in addition the decrease in qualified pilots driven by federal regulations has adversely impacted and could continue to affect the company’s regional flying for example the faa’s expansion of minimum pilot qualification standards including a requirement that a pilot have at least 1500 total flight hours as well as the faa’s revised pilot flight and duty time rules effective january 2014 have contributed to an increasing need for pilots for regional carriers the decrease in qualified pilots resulting from the regulations as well as factors including a decreased student pilot population and a shrinking us military from which to hire qualified pilots could adversely impact the company’s operations and financial condition and also require the company to reduce regional carrier flying 

if a significant disruption occurs to the company’s regional network or flights or if one or more of the regional carriers with which the company has relationships is unable to perform their obligations over an extended period of time there could be a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and operations 

the company is subject to increasing legislative and regulatory and customer focus on privacy issues and data security 

the company is subject to increasing legislative and regulatory and customer focus on privacy issues and data security a number of the company’s commercial partners including credit card companies have imposed data security standards that the company must meet and these standards continue to evolve the company will continue its efforts to meet new and increasing privacy and security standards however it is possible that certain new standards may be difficult to meet and could increase the company’s costs additionally any compromise of the company’s technology systems could result in the loss disclosure misappropriation of or access to customers’ employees’ or business partners’ information any such loss disclosure misappropriation or access could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information any significant data breach or the company’s failure to comply with applicable us and foreign privacy or data security regulations or security standards imposed by the company’s commercial partners may adversely affect the company’s reputation business results of operations and financial condition 

economic and industry conditions constantly change and unfavorable global economic conditions may have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations 

the company’s business and results of operations are significantly impacted by general economic and industry conditions the airline industry is highly cyclical and the level of demand for air travel is correlated to the strength of the us and global economies robust demand for the company’s air transportation services depends largely on favorable economic conditions including the strength of the domestic and foreign economies low unemployment levels strong consumer confidence levels and the availability of consumer and business credit 

air transportation is often a discretionary purchase that leisure travelers may limit or eliminate during difficult economic times in addition during periods of unfavorable economic conditions business travelers usually reduce the volume of their travel either due to costsaving initiatives or as a result of decreased business activity requiring travel during such periods the company’s business and results of operations may be adversely affected due to significant declines in industry passenger demand particularly with respect to the company’s business and premium cabin travelers and a reduction in fare levels 

stagnant or weakening global economic conditions either in the united states or in other geographic regions and any future volatility in us and global financial and credit markets may have a material adverse effect on the company’s revenues results of operations and liquidity if such economic conditions were to disrupt capital markets in the future the company may be unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all to refinance certain maturing debt and to satisfy future capital commitments 

  

the company could experience adverse publicity harm to its brand reduced travel demand and potential tort liability as a result of an accident catastrophe or incident involving its aircraft the aircraft of its regional carriers or the aircraft of its codeshare partners which may result in a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial position 

an accident catastrophe or incident involving an aircraft that the company operates or an aircraft that is operated by a codeshare partner or one of the company’s regional carriers could have a material adverse effect on the company if such accident catastrophe or incident created a public perception that the company’s operations or the operations of its codeshare partners or regional carriers are not safe or reliable or less safe or reliable than other airlines such public perception could in turn result in adverse publicity for the company cause harm to the company’s brand and reduce travel demand on the company’s flights or the flights of its codeshare partners or regional carriers 

in addition any such accident catastrophe or incident could expose the company to significant tort liability although the company currently maintains liability insurance in amounts and of the type the company believes to be consistent with industry practice to cover damages arising from any such accident or catastrophe and the company’s codeshare partners and regional carriers carry similar insurance and generally indemnify the company for their operations if the company’s liability exceeds the applicable policy limits or the ability of another carrier to indemnify it the company could incur substantial losses from an accident catastrophe or incident which may result in a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial position 

the company’s business relies extensively on thirdparty service providers failure of these parties to perform as expected or interruptions in the company’s relationships with these providers or their provision of services to the company could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the company has engaged an increasing number of thirdparty service providers to perform a large number of functions that are integral to its business including regional operations operation of customer service call centers distribution and sale of airline seat inventory provision of information technology infrastructure and services transmitting or uploading of data provision of aircraft maintenance and repairs provision of various utilities and performance of aircraft fueling operations among other vital functions and services the company does not directly control these thirdparty service providers although it does enter into agreements with many of them that define expected service performance any of these thirdparty service providers however may materially fail to meet their service performance commitments to the company may suffer disruptions to their systems that could impact their services or the agreements with such providers may be terminated for example flight reservations booked by customers and travel agencies via thirdparty gdss may be adversely affected by disruptions in the business relationships between the company and gds operators such disruptions including a failure to agree upon acceptable contract terms when contracts expire or otherwise become subject to renegotiation may cause the company’s flight information to be limited or unavailable for display significantly increase fees for both the company and gds users and impair the company’s relationships with its customers and travel agencies the failure of any of the company’s thirdparty service providers to perform their service obligations adequately or other interruptions of services may reduce the company’s revenues and increase its expenses prevent the company from operating its flights and providing other services to its customers or result in adverse publicity or harm to its brand in addition the company’s business and financial performance could be materially harmed if its customers believe that its services are unreliable or unsatisfactory 

inadequate liquidity or a negative impact on the company’s liquidity from factors beyond the company’s control may have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position and business 

the company has a significant amount of financial leverage from fixed obligations including aircraft lease and debt financings leases of airport property and other facilities and other material cash obligations in addition the company has substantial noncancelable commitments for capital expenditures including for the acquisition of new aircraft and related spare engines 

  

although the company’s cash flows from operations and its available capital including the proceeds from financing transactions have been sufficient to meet these obligations and commitments to date the company’s future liquidity could be negatively affected by the risk factors discussed in this item 1a including but not limited to substantial volatility in the price of fuel adverse economic conditions disruptions in the global capital markets and catastrophic external events 

if the company’s liquidity is constrained due to the various risk factors noted in this item 1a or otherwise the company might not be able to timely pay its debts or comply with certain operating and financial covenants under its financing and credit card processing agreements or with other material provisions of its contractual obligations these covenants require the company or united as applicable to maintain minimum liquidity andor minimum collateral coverage ratios depending on the particular agreement the company’s ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond its control including the overall industry revenue environment the level of fuel costs and the appraised value of certain collateral 

if the company does not timely pay its debts or comply with such covenants a variety of adverse consequences could result these potential adverse consequences include an increase of required reserves under credit card processing agreements withholding of credit card sale proceeds by its credit card service providers loss of undrawn lines of credit the occurrence of one or more events of default under the relevant agreements the acceleration of the maturity of debt andor the exercise of other remedies by its creditors and equipment lessors that could result in a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations the company cannot provide assurance that it would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance such debt if it were accelerated in addition an event of default or acceleration of debt under certain of its financing agreements could result in one or more events of default under certain of the company’s other financing agreements due to cross default and cross acceleration provisions 

furthermore constrained liquidity may limit the company’s ability to withstand competitive pressures and downturns in the travel business and the economy in general 

the company’s substantial level of indebtedness and noninvestment grade credit rating as well as market conditions and the availability of assets as collateral for loans or other indebtedness may make it difficult for the company to raise additional capital to meet its liquidity needs on acceptable terms or at all 

see part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report for additional information regarding the company’s liquidity 

union disputes employee strikes or slowdowns and other laborrelated disruptions as well as the integration of united’s workforces in connection with the company’s merger transaction in 2010 could adversely affect the company’s operations and could result in increased costs that impair its financial performance 

united is a highly unionized company as of december 31 2014 the company and its subsidiaries had approximately 84000 active employees of whom approximately 80 were represented by various us labor organizations 

the successful integration of united’s workforces in connection with the company’s merger transaction in 2010 and achievement of the anticipated benefits of the combined company depend in part on integrating employee groups and maintaining productive employee relations in order to fully integrate the company’s premerger represented employee groups the company must negotiate a joint collective bargaining agreement covering each combined group the process for integrating the labor groups is governed by a combination of the rla the mccaskillbond amendment and where applicable the existing provisions of collective bargaining agreements and union policies a delay in or failure to integrate employee groups presents the potential for increased operating costs and labor disputes that could adversely affect the company’s operations 

the company can provide no assurance that a successful or timely resolution of labor negotiations for all amendable collective bargaining agreements will be achieved there is a risk that unions or individual employees might pursue judicial or arbitral claims arising out of changes implemented as a result of the company’s merger 

  

transaction in 2010 there is also a possibility that employees or unions could engage in job actions such as slowdowns worktorule campaigns sickouts or other actions designed to disrupt the company’s normal operations in an attempt to pressure the company in collective bargaining negotiations although the rla makes such actions unlawful until the parties have been lawfully released to selfhelp and the company can seek injunctive relief against premature selfhelp such actions can cause significant harm even if ultimately enjoined in addition achieving joint collective bargaining agreements with the company’s represented employee groups is likely to increase the company’s labor costs which increase could be material 

see notes 15 and 17 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information on labor negotiations and costs 

an outbreak of a disease or similar public health threat could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business financial position and results of operations 

an outbreak of a disease or similar public health threat that affects travel demand or travel behavior or travel restrictions or reduction in the demand for air travel caused by an outbreak of a disease or similar public health threat in the future could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

the company is subject to economic and political instability and other risks of doing business globally 

the company is a global business with operations outside of the united states from which it derives approximately 40 of its operating revenues as measured and reported to the dot the company’s operations in asia europe latin america africa and the middle east are a vital part of its worldwide airline network volatile economic political and market conditions in these international regions may have a negative impact on the company’s operating results and its ability to achieve its business objectives in addition significant or volatile changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies and the imposition of exchange controls or other currency restrictions may have a material adverse impact upon the company’s liquidity revenues costs and operating results 

most recently economic instability in venezuela resulted in exchange rate changes that apply to the company’s funds held in venezuelan bolivars the company had approximately 100 million of its unrestricted cash balance held in venezuelan bolivars as of december 31 2014 based on a mix of historical rates in effect at the time of submission for repatriation there can be no assurance that the company will be able to repatriate any or all of the funds held in venezuelan bolivars in the future additionally the amount and exchange rate at which the balance of funds will be repatriated could change resulting in a loss to the company if economic instability and devaluation of the local currency continue for a period of time in venezuela such conditions may have an adverse impact on the company’s business 

extensive government regulation could increase the company’s operating costs and restrict its ability to conduct its business 

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal oversight compliance with us and international regulations imposes significant costs and may have adverse effects on the company laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges both domestically and internationally have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce airline revenue the company cannot provide any assurance that current laws and regulations or laws or regulations enacted in the future will not adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations 

united provides air transportation under certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by the dot if the dot altered amended modified suspended or revoked these certificates it could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business the dot is also responsible for promulgating consumer protection and other regulations such as the rule against lengthy tarmac delays that will impose significant compliance costs on the company the faa regulates the safety of united’s operations united operates pursuant to an air carrier operating certificate issued by the faa in january 2014 the faa’s more stringent pilot flight and duty time 

  

requirements under part 117 of the federal aviation regulations took effect which has increased costs for all carriers in july 2014 minimum qualifications took effect for air carrier first officers these regulations impact the company and its regional partner flying as they have caused mainline airlines to hire regional pilots while simultaneously significantly reducing the pool of new pilots from which regional carriers themselves can hire although this is an industry issue it directly affects the company and requires it to reduce regional partner flying as several regional partners have experienced difficulty flying their schedules due to reduced pilot availability from time to time the faa also issues orders airworthiness directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require material expenditures or operational restrictions by the company these faa orders and directives could include the temporary grounding of an entire aircraft type if the faa identifies design manufacturing maintenance or other issues requiring immediate corrective action faa requirements cover among other things retirement of older aircraft security measures collision avoidance systems airborne windshear avoidance systems noise abatement and other environmental concerns aircraft operation and safety and increased inspections and maintenance procedures to be conducted on older aircraft these faa directives or requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company also osha’s regulatory programs for hazard communication hearing conservation and bloodborne pathogens in the areas of cabin crewmember safety and health which began in march 2014 have exposed the company to increased regulatory requirements in the aircraft cabin with associated increased costs and the possibility for operational impacts 

in addition the company’s operations may be adversely impacted due to the existing antiquated air traffic control “atc” system utilized by the us government during peak travel periods in certain markets the current atc system’s inability to handle existing travel demand has led to shortterm capacity constraints imposed by government agencies and resulted in delays and disruptions of air traffic in addition the current system will not be able to effectively handle projected future air traffic growth imposition of these atc constraints on a longterm basis may have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations failure to update the atc system in a timely manner and the substantial funding requirements of a modernized atc system that may be imposed on air carriers may have an adverse impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

the airline industry is subject to extensive federal state and local taxes and fees that increase the cost of the company’s operations in addition to taxes and fees that the company is currently subject to proposed taxes and fees are currently pending and if imposed would increase the company’s operating expenses 

access to landing and takeoff rights or “slots” at several major us airports and many foreign airports served by the company are or recently have been subject to government regulation certain of the company’s major hubs are among increasingly congested airports in the united states and have been or could be the subject of regulatory action that might limit the number of flights andor increase costs of operations at certain times or throughout the day the faa may limit the company’s airport access by limiting the number of departure and arrival slots at high density traffic airports which could affect the company’s ownership and transfer rights and local airport authorities may have the ability to control access to certain facilities or the cost of access to its facilities which could have an adverse effect on the company’s business the faa historically has taken actions with respect to airlines’ slot holdings that airlines have challenged if the faa were to take actions that adversely affect the company’s slot holdings the company could incur substantial costs to preserve its slots further the company’s operating costs at airports at which it operates including the company’s major hubs may increase significantly because of capital improvements at such airports that the company may be required to fund directly or indirectly in some circumstances such costs could be imposed by the relevant airport authority without the company’s approval and may have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition 

the ability of carriers to operate flights on international routes between airports in the united states and other countries may be subject to change applicable arrangements between the united states and foreign governments may be amended from time to time government policies with respect to airport operations may be revised and the availability of appropriate slots or facilities may change the company currently operates a number of flights on international routes under government arrangements regulations or policies that designate the number of 

  

carriers permitted to operate on such routes the capacity of the carriers providing services on such routes the airports at which carriers may operate international flights or the number of carriers allowed access to particular airports any further limitations additions or modifications to such arrangements regulations or policies could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations additionally a change in law regulation or policy for any of the company’s international routes such as open skies could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial position and results of operations and could result in the impairment of material amounts of related tangible and intangible assets in addition competition from revenuesharing joint ventures and other alliance arrangements by and among other airlines could impair the value of the company’s business and assets on the open skies routes the company’s plans to enter into or expand us antitrust immunized alliances and joint ventures on various international routes are subject to receipt of approvals from applicable us federal authorities and obtaining other applicable foreign government clearances or satisfying the necessary applicable regulatory requirements there can be no assurance that such approvals and clearances will be granted or will continue in effect upon further regulatory review or that changes in regulatory requirements or standards can be satisfied 

many aspects of the company’s operations are also subject to increasingly stringent federal state local and international laws protecting the environment future environmental regulatory developments such as climate change regulations in the united states and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in the airline industry there are certain climate change laws and regulations that have already gone into effect and that apply to the company including the eu ets the state of california’s greenhouse gas cap and trade regulations environmental taxes for certain international flights limited greenhouse gas reporting requirements and landuse planning laws which could apply to airports and could affect airlines in certain circumstances in addition there is the potential for additional regulatory actions in regard to the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry the precise nature of future requirements and their applicability to the company are difficult to predict but the financial impact to the company and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant 

in 2015 the us congress will begin consideration of legislation to reauthorize the faa which encompasses all significant aviation tax and policy related issues as with previous reauthorization legislation the us congress may consider a range of policy changes that could impact the company’s operations and costs 

see part i item 1 business—industry regulation of this report for additional information on government regulation impacting the company 

the airline industry is highly competitive and susceptible to price discounting and changes in capacity which could have a material adverse effect on the company 

the us airline industry is characterized by substantial price competition including from lowcost carriers the significant market presence of lowcost carriers which engage in substantial price discounting has diminished the ability of large network carriers to achieve sustained profitability on domestic and international routes 

airlines also compete for market share by increasing or decreasing their capacity including route systems and the number of markets served several of the company’s domestic and international competitors have increased their international capacity by including service to some destinations that the company currently serves causing overlap in destinations served and therefore increasing competition for those destinations in addition the company and certain of its competitors have implemented significant capacity reductions in recent years in response to high and volatile fuel prices and stagnant global economic growth further certain of the company’s competitors may not reduce capacity or may increase capacity impacting the expected benefit to the company from capacity reductions this increased competition in both domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

  

ual’s obligations for funding united’s defined benefit pension plans are affected by factors beyond ual’s control 

the company maintains two primary defined benefit pension plans one covering certain pilot employees and another covering certain us nonpilot employees the timing and amount of ual’s funding requirements under these plans depend upon a number of factors including labor negotiations with the applicable employee groups and changes to pension plan benefits as well as factors outside of ual’s control such as the number of applicable retiring employees asset returns interest rates and changes in pension laws changes to these and other factors that can significantly increase ual’s funding requirements such as its liquidity requirements could have a material adverse effect on ual’s financial condition 

the airline industry may undergo further consolidation creation or modification of alliances or joint ventures or bankruptcy restructuring any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company 

the company faces and may continue to face strong competition from other carriers due to industry consolidation the creation and modification of alliances and joint ventures and bankruptcy restructuring both the us and international airline industries have experienced consolidation through a number of mergers and acquisitions the company is also facing stronger competition from expanded airline alliances and joint ventures carriers may improve their competitive positions through airline alliances slot swaps andor joint ventures certain types of airline joint ventures further competition by allowing multiple airlines to coordinate routes pool revenues and costs and enjoy other mutual benefits achieving many of the benefits of consolidation “open skies” agreements including the agreements between the united states and the european union and between the united states and japan may also give rise to additional consolidation or better integration opportunities among international carriers movement of airlines between current global airline alliances could reduce joint network coverage for members of such alliances while also creating opportunities for joint ventures and bilateral alliances that did not exist before such realignment a number of carriers both domestic and international have filed for bankruptcy protection in the last ten years and other domestic and international carriers could restructure or consolidate in bankruptcy or threaten to do so in the future to reduce their costs carriers operating under bankruptcy protection can operate in a manner that could be adverse to the company could divest assets to the company’s competitors and could emerge from bankruptcy as more vigorous competitors 

there is ongoing speculation that further airline and airline alliance consolidations or reorganizations could occur in the future the company routinely engages in analysis and discussions regarding its own strategic position including current and potential alliances asset acquisitions and divestitures and may have future discussions with other airlines regarding strategic activities if other airlines participate in such activities those airlines may significantly improve their cost structures or revenue generation capabilities thereby potentially making them stronger competitors of the company and potentially impairing the company’s ability to realize expected benefits from its own strategic relationships 

increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage may materially and adversely impact the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

the company could be exposed to significant liability or loss if its property or operations were to be affected by a natural catastrophe or other event including aircraft accidents if the company is unable to obtain sufficient insurance including but not limited to aviation hull and liability insurance workers’ compensation and property and business interruption coverage to cover such liabilities or losses whether due to insurance market conditions or otherwise its results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

following the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 the company’s insurance costs increased significantly and the availability of thirdparty war risk terrorism insurance decreased significantly from september 2001 through may 2014 the company obtained thirdparty war risk terrorism insurance through a faaadministered program in anticipation of the government discontinuing this program effective may 2014 the company terminated its faaadministered insurance and returned to the commercial insurance markets to obtain thirdparty war risk 

  

terrorism insurance the government subsequently discontinued the faaadministered program in december 2014 if the company is unable in the future to obtain thirdparty war risk terrorism insurance with acceptable terms or if the coverage obtained is insufficient relative to actual liability or losses that the company experiences its results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

the company’s results of operations fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors associated with the airline industry 

due to greater demand for air travel during the spring and summer months revenues in the airline industry in the second and third quarters of the year are generally stronger than revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year which are periods of lower travel demand the company’s results of operations generally reflect this seasonality but have also been impacted by numerous other factors that are not necessarily seasonal including among others the imposition of excise and similar taxes extreme or severe weather air traffic control congestion geological events natural disasters changes in the competitive environment due to industry consolidation general economic conditions and other factors as a result the company’s quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year and historical operating results in a quarterly or annual period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 

the company may never realize the full value of its intangible assets or its longlived assets causing it to record impairments that may negatively affect its financial position and results of operations 

in accordance with applicable accounting standards the company is required to test its indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis on october 1 of each year or more frequently if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred in addition the company is required to test certain of its other assets for impairment if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred 

the company may be required to recognize impairments in the future due to among other factors extreme fuel price volatility tight credit markets a decline in the fair value of certain tangible or intangible assets unfavorable trends in historical or forecasted results of operations and cash flows and an uncertain economic environment as well as other uncertainties the company can provide no assurance that a material impairment charge of tangible or intangible assets will not occur in a future period the value of the company’s aircraft could be impacted in future periods by changes in supply and demand for these aircraft such changes in supply and demand for certain aircraft types could result from grounding of aircraft by the company or other carriers an impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the company’s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for us federal income tax purposes may be significantly limited due to various circumstances including certain possible future transactions involving the sale or issuance of ual common stock or if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels 

as of december 31 2014 ual reported consolidated federal net operating loss “nol” carryforwards of approximately 96 billion 

the company’s ability to use its nol carryforwards may be limited if it experiences an “ownership change” as defined in section 382 “section 382” of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended an ownership change generally occurs if certain stockholders increase their aggregate percentage ownership of a corporation’s stock by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest percentage ownership at any time during the testing period which is generally the threeyear period preceding any potential ownership change 

there is no assurance that the company will not experience a future ownership change under section 382 that may significantly limit or possibly eliminate its ability to use its nol carryforwards potential future transactions involving the sale or issuance of ual common stock including the exercise of conversion options under the terms of any convertible debt that ual may issue in the future the repurchase of such debt with ual common stock any issuance of ual common stock for cash and the acquisition or disposition of such stock by a 

  

stockholder owning 5 or more of ual common stock or a combination of such transactions may increase the possibility that the company will experience a future ownership change under section 382 

under section 382 a future ownership change would subject the company to additional annual limitations that apply to the amount of preownership change nols that may be used to offset postownership change taxable income this limitation is generally determined by multiplying the value of a corporation’s stock immediately before the ownership change by the applicable longterm taxexempt rate any unused annual limitation may subject to certain limits be carried over to later years and the limitation may under certain circumstances be increased by builtin gains in the assets held by such corporation at the time of the ownership change this limitation could cause the company’s us federal income taxes to be greater or to be paid earlier than they otherwise would be and could cause all or a portion of the company’s nol carryforwards to expire unused similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes the company’s ability to use its nol carryforwards will also depend on the amount of taxable income it generates in future periods its nol carryforwards may expire before the company can generate sufficient taxable income to use them in full 

ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation limits certain transfers of its stock which could have an effect on the market price of ual common stock 

to reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect on the company’s ability to use its nol carryforwards for federal income tax purposes ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains a 5 ownership limitation this limitation generally remains effective until february 1 2017 or until such later date as may be approved by the board of directors in its sole discretion the limitation prohibits i an acquisition by a single stockholder of shares that results in that stockholder owning 5 or more of ual common stock and ii any acquisition or disposition of common stock by a stockholder that already owns 5 or more of ual common stock unless prior written approval is granted by the board of directors 

any transfer of common stock in violation of these restrictions will be void and will be treated as if such transfer never occurred this provision of ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation may impair or prevent a sale of common stock by a stockholder and adversely affect the price at which a stockholder can sell ual common stock in addition this limitation may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the company creating a perception that a change in control cannot occur or otherwise discouraging takeover attempts that some stockholders may consider beneficial which could also adversely affect the market price of the ual common stock the company cannot predict the effect that this provision in ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation may have on the market price of the ual common stock for additional information regarding the 5 ownership limitation please refer to ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation available on the company’s website 

certain provisions of ual’s governance documents could discourage or delay changes of control or changes to the board of directors 

certain provisions of ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws together the “governance documents” may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the board of directors and may discourage takeover attempts that some of its stockholders may consider beneficial 

certain provisions of the governance documents may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if the board of directors determines that such changes in control are not in the best interests of ual and its stockholders these provisions of the governance documents are not intended to prevent a takeover but are intended to protect and maximize the value of ual’s stockholders’ interests while these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of ual to negotiate with the board of directors they could enable the board of directors to prevent a transaction that some or a majority of its stockholders might believe to be in their best interests or they could prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

  

the issuance of additional shares of ual’s capital stock including the issuance of common stock upon conversion of convertible notes would cause dilution to the interests of its existing stockholders 

ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes up to one billion shares of common stock in certain circumstances ual can issue shares of common stock without stockholder approval in addition the board of directors is authorized to issue up to 250 million shares of preferred stock without par value without any action on the part of ual’s stockholders the board of directors also has the power without stockholder approval to set the terms of any series of shares of preferred stock that may be issued including voting rights conversion rights dividend rights preferences over ual’s common stock with respect to dividends or if ual liquidates dissolves or winds up its business and other terms if ual issues preferred stock in the future that has a preference over its common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon its liquidation dissolution or winding up or if ual issues preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of its common stock the rights of holders of its common stock or the market price of its common stock could be adversely affected 

the company is also authorized to issue without stockholder approval other securities convertible into either preferred stock or in certain circumstances common stock the number of shares issued could be significant and such an issuance could cause significant dilution to the interests of its existing stockholders in addition if ual elects to pay the repurchase price in cash its liquidity could be adversely affected 

in the future ual may decide to raise additional capital through offerings of ual common stock securities convertible into ual common stock or exercise rights to acquire these securities or its common stock the issuance of additional shares of common stock including upon the conversion or repurchase of convertible debt could result in significant dilution of existing stockholders’ equity interests in ual issuances of substantial amounts of its common stock or the perception that such issuances could occur may adversely affect prevailing market prices for ual’s common stock and ual cannot predict the effect this dilution may have on the price of its common stock

 2014 operational highlights 

 

  

 2015 outlook 

set forth below is a discussion of the principal matters that we believe could impact our financial and operating performance and cause our results of operations in future periods to differ materially from our historical operating results andor from our anticipated results of operations described in the forwardlooking statements in this report see item 1a risk factors of this report and the factors described under “forwardlooking information” below for additional discussion of these and other factors that could affect us 

  

the company is committed to improving the efficiency and quality of all aspects of its business in 2015 key initiatives for the year include improving our operational reliability and the handling of customers during irregular operations such as adverse weather improving our customer experience by adding satellitebased wifi to nearly all our mainline aircraft introducing a new unitedcom website refurbishing aircraft interiors investing in our airports and taking delivery of more than 40 new highlyefficient and customerpleasing aircraft and improving our financial performance 

economic conditions the economic outlook for the aviation industry in 2015 is characterized by expected slow or modest us and global economic growth in such conditions we expect a modest increase in the demand for air travel continuing economic uncertainty along with the strengthening us dollar is providing uncertainty in key asian and european markets and along with continued political and socioeconomic tensions in regions such as the middle east may result in diminished demand for air travel the global economy is also being impacted by declining oil prices putting pressure on certain geographic markets 

capacity over the past three years the company leveraged the flexibility of its fleet to better match capacity with market demand in 2015 the company expects consolidated asms to grow between 15 and 25 yearoveryear 

fuel the company’s average aircraft fuel price per gallon including related taxes was 299 in 2014 as compared to 313 in 2013 recently the price of jet fuel has declined but remains volatile decreases in fuel prices for an extended period may result in increased industry capacity increased competitive actions for market share and lower fares or surcharges in general if fuel prices were subsequently to rise significantly there may be a lag between improvement of revenue and the adverse impact of higher fuel prices given the highly competitive nature of the airline industry the company may not be able to increase its fares and fees sufficiently to offset the full impact of increases in fuel prices especially if these increases are rapid and sustained further such fare and fee increases may not be sustainable may reduce the general demand for air travel and may also eventually impact the company’s strategic growth and investment plans for the future based on projected fuel consumption in 2015 a one dollar change in the price of a barrel of crude oil would change the company’s annual fuel expense by approximately 93 million to protect against increases in the prices of aircraft fuel the company routinely hedges a portion of its future fuel requirements 

labor as of december 31 2014 united had approximately 80 of employees represented by unions during 2014 united’s maintenance instructor load planner fleet technical instructor security officer and dispatcher work groups ratified new joint labor agreements we are in the process of negotiating joint collective bargaining agreements with our technicians and flight attendants the company cannot predict the outcome of negotiations with its unionized employee groups although significant increases in the pay and benefits resulting from new collective bargaining agreements would have a material financial impact on the company 

casm in 2015 the company expects casm excluding fuel thirdparty business expense profit sharing and special charges to be flat to up one percent yearoveryear we are unable to project casm on a gaap basis as the nature and amount of special charges are not determinable at this time 

the company’s cost initiative project that began in 2014 called project quality has a goal to reduce the company’s annual costs by 2 billion and generate an incremental 700 million in additional ancillary revenue by the end of 2017 the anticipated savings are comprised of 1 billion in annual fuel savings based on fuel prices in 2013 and 1 billion of nonfuel savings in 2014 the company achieved approximately 200 million in fuel savings and 380 million in nonfuel savings 

mileageplus effective march 1 2015 the company will modify its mileageplus program for most tickets from the current model in which members earn redeemable miles based on distance traveled to one based on ticket price including base fare and carrier imposed surcharges members will be able to earn between five and eleven miles per dollar spent based on their mileageplus status the updated program will enhance the rewards for customers who spend more with united and give them improved mileageearning opportunities 

  

results of operations 

in this section we compare results of operations for the year ended december 31 2014 with results of operations for the year ended december 31 2013 and results of operations for the year ended december 31 2013 with results of operations for the year ended december 31 2012 nongaap financial measures are presented because they provide management and investors with the ability to measure and monitor the company’s performance on a consistent basis

 the table below presents the company’s selected passenger revenue and selected operating data based on geographic region regional flights consist primarily of domestic routes 

 

  a see part ii item 6 of this report for the definition of these statistics 

consolidated passenger revenue in 2014 increased 640 million or 19 as compared to 2013 this increase was primarily due to an increase in consolidated yield of 17 and an increase in average fare per passenger of 28 there was also an increase in capacity and traffic of 03and 02 respectively as compared to 2013 the 2014 average fare increase was due in part to a strong domestic demand environment and a number of new longhaul routes that generated higher fares than the system average also in 2014 the company improved its revenue management demand forecast process related to closein bookings which improved yields 2013 consolidated passenger revenue was negatively impacted by factors including additional competitive capacity in china and the japanese yen weakening against the us dollar resulting in lower pacific yields 

  

cargo revenue increased by 56 million or 63 in 2014 as compared to 2013 which was primarily due to higher freight volumes and an improvement in mail revenue yearoveryear partially offset by lower yield on freight 

other operating revenue decreased 74 million or 17 in 2014 as compared to 2013 which was primarily due to the company’s decision to discontinue sales of aircraft fuel to a third party partially offset by increases in ancillary mileageplus and contract services revenue 

operating expense 

the table below includes data related to the company’s operating expense for the year ended december 31 in millions except percentage changes 

 

 the decrease in aircraft fuel expense was primarily attributable to decreased fuel prices partially offset by losses from fuel hedging activity and a 03 increase in capacity

salaries and related costs increased 310 million or 36 in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to higher pay rates driven by collective bargaining agreements increased medical and dental costs and costs associated with crew shortages and new crew rest rules partially offset by lower postemployment benefit costs 

  

landing fees and other rent increased 184 million or 88 in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to a transition from paying regional carriers for landing fees to paying airports directly landing fees have also increased due to airport security services and modernization projects at certain airport locations 

aircraft rent decreased 53 million or 57 in 2014 as compared to 2013 primarily due to aircraft lease expirations and terminations of several boeing 757200 aircraft leases resulting from the company’s purchase of the leased aircraft

 see note 17 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information

the following table illustrates the yearoveryear dollar and percentage changes in the company’s nonoperating income expense in millions except percentage changes 

 

 the decrease in interest expense of 48 million or 61 in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to the company’s extinguishment of certain of its debt instruments and the refinancing of certain of its debt instruments at lower interest rates 

in 2014 miscellaneous net included a mtm loss of 465 million from fuel hedge derivatives as compared to a gain of 84 million in 2013 miscellaneous net also included foreign currency losses of 41 million and 29 million in 2014 and 2013 respectively 2014 miscellaneous net includes a 64 million debt extinguishment charge related to the retirement of the 248 million 6 convertible junior subordinated debentures

2013 compared to 2012 

operating revenue 

the table below illustrates the yearoveryear percentage change in the company’s operating revenues for the years ended december 31 in millions except percentage changes 

 

 the table below presents the company’s selected passenger revenue and selected operating data based on geographic region regional flights consist primarily of domestic routes 

 

  

 consolidated passenger revenue in 2013 increased 539 million or 17 as compared to 2012 this increase was primarily due to an increase in consolidated yield of 18 and an increase in average fare per passenger of 26 offset in part by a decline in capacity of 14 and a reduction in traffic of 02 as compared to the yearago period consolidated passenger revenue was also impacted by factors including additional competitive capacity in china and the japanese yen weakening against the us dollar resulting in lower pacific yields and a revenue management demand forecast which underestimated the amount of closein booking demand resulting in a lowerthanexpected yield mix in 2013 

cargo revenue decreased by 136 million or 134 in 2013 as compared to 2012 due to lower volumes on freight primarily in the domestic and atlantic regions offset slightly by an increase in mail revenue for the period both freight volume and yield continued to decrease in 2013 compared to 2012 due primarily to the continuation of declining demand for shipments of freight 

other operating revenue increased 724 million or 204 in 2013 as compared to 2012 which was primarily due to the sale of aircraft fuel of approximately 400 million to a third party other operating revenue also increased due to additional revenue from nonairline partners under our mileageplus loyalty program passenger ticket change fees and sales of airport lounge access 

  

operating expense 

the table below includes data related to the company’s operating expense for the year ended december 31 in millions except percentage changes 

 

 the significant decrease in aircraft fuel expense was primarily attributable to decreased fuel prices a 14 reduction in capacity and gains losses from fuel hedging activity in both years as shown in the table below 

 

  

a includes ineffectiveness gains losses on cashsettled hedges and gains losses on cashsettled hedges that were not designated for hedge accounting these amounts are recorded in nonoperating income expense miscellaneous net 

salaries and related costs increased 680 million or 86 in 2013 as compared to 2012 the increase was due to higher pay rates driven by new collective bargaining agreements profit sharing and other incentive programs as well as increased pension and retirement plan costs 

landing fees and other rent increased 161 million or 83 in 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily due to a transition from paying regional carriers for landing fees to paying airports directly landing fees paid directly to airports are charged to landing fees and other rent while payments to regional carriers are recorded to regional capacity purchase as a result of this change there was a significant shift of expense out of regional capacity purchase into landing fees and other rent in 2013 other rent also increased as a result of the increase in rent at newark liberty pursuant to an amendment to united’s terminal c lease signed in early 2013 that extended the term of the terminal c lease with respect to concourses c1 and c2 at newark liberty until 2033 

  

aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs increased 61 million or 35 in 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily due to increased volume and scope of airframe heavy checks mainly on the boeing 747 and boeing 757 fleet types partially offset by a reduction in engine maintenance volumes driven mainly by the timing of overhauls 

depreciation and amortization increased 167 million or 110 in 2013 as compared to 2012 due to additions in owned property and equipment in the current year specifically related to new aircraft and improvements at airport facilities as well as accelerated depreciation of 89 million on 30 boeing 757200 aircraft in process of being sold to a third party 

other operating expenses increased 514 million or 110 in 2013 as compared to 2012 due to the cost of aircraft fuel sold to a third party and an increase in other personnelrelated expenses

the following table illustrates the yearoveryear dollar and percentage changes in ual’s nonoperating income expense in millions except percentage changes

in 2013 miscellaneous net included a gain of 84 million from fuel hedge derivatives as compared to a gain of 37 million in 2012 

united’s nonoperating expense also included a net gain of 70 million associated with marking to market the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities related to agreements that provide for united’s convertible debt to be settled with ual common stock as compared to a net gain of 42 million in 2012 this net gain and related derivatives were reflected only in the united standalone financial statements as they were eliminated at the consolidated level see note 9 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information

the table below provides a summary of the company’s material contractual obligations as of december 31 2014 in billions 

 

    

     offbalance sheet arrangements an offbalance sheet arrangement is any transaction agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has 1 made guarantees 2 a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets 3 an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or 4 any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support or that engages in leasing hedging or research and development arrangements the company’s primary offbalance sheet arrangements include operating leases which are summarized in the contractual obligations table in contractual obligations above and certain municipal bond obligations as discussed below

increased cost provisions see note 15 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information on increased cost provisions related to the company’s debt 

fuel consortia united participates in numerous fuel consortia with other air carriers at major airports to reduce the costs of fuel distribution and storage interline agreements govern the rights and responsibilities of the consortia members and provide for the allocation of the overall costs to operate the consortia based on usage the consortia and in limited cases the participating carriers have entered into longterm agreements to lease certain airport fuel storage and distribution facilities that are typically financed through taxexempt bonds either special facilities lease revenue bonds or general airport revenue bonds issued by various local municipalities in general each consortium lease agreement requires the consortium to make lease payments in amounts sufficient to pay the maturing principal and interest payments on the bonds as of december 31 2014 approximately 14 billion principal amount of such bonds were secured by significant fuel facility leases in which united

critical accounting policies 

critical accounting policies are defined as those that are affected by significant judgments and uncertainties which potentially could result in materially different accounting under different assumptions and conditions the company has prepared the financial statements in conformity with us gaap which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions the company has identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of the financial statements 

passenger revenue recognition the value of unused passenger tickets is included in current liabilities as advance ticket sales the company records passenger ticket sales and tickets sold by other airlines for use on united as passenger revenue when the transportation is provided or upon estimated breakage tickets sold by other airlines are recorded at the estimated values to be billed to the other airlines differences between amounts billed and the actual amounts may be rejected and rebilled or written off if the amount recorded was different from the original estimate when necessary the company records a reserve against our interline billings and payables if historical experience indicates that these amounts are different nonrefundable tickets generally expire on the date of the intended flight unless the date is extended by notification from the customer on or before the intended flight date 

fees charged in association with changes or extensions to nonrefundable tickets are recorded as other revenue at the time the fee is incurred the fare on the changed ticket including any additional collection of fare is deferred and recognized in accordance with our transportation revenue recognition policy at the time the transportation is provided change fees related to nonrefundable tickets are considered a separate transaction from the air transportation because they represent a charge for the company’s additional service to modify a previous sale therefore the pricing of the change fee and the initial customer order are separately determined and represent distinct earnings processes 

the company records an estimate of breakage revenue on the flight date for tickets that will expire unused these estimates are based on the evaluation of actual historical results and forecasted trends refundable tickets expire after one year from the date of issuance 

in may 2014 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” amended the fasb accounting standards codification and created a new topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers this amendment prescribes that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the amendment supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in topic 605 revenue recognition and most industryspecific guidance throughout the industry topics of the codification the amendments will become effective for the company’s annual and interim reporting periods beginning january 1 2017 under the new standard certain airline ancillary fees directly related to passenger revenue tickets such as airline change fees and baggage fees are likely to no longer be considered distinct performance obligations separate from the passenger travel component in addition the change fees which were previously recognized when incurred will likely be recognized when transportation is provided the company is evaluating other impacts on its consolidated financial statements 

frequent flyer accounting the company’s mileageplus program is designed to increase customer loyalty program participants earn miles by flying on united and certain other participating airlines program participants can also earn miles through purchases from other nonairline partners that participate in the company’s loyalty 

  

program we sell miles to these partners which include credit card issuers retail merchants hotels car rental companies and our participating airline partners miles can be redeemed for free other than taxes and government imposed fees discounted or upgraded air travel and nontravel awards the company records its obligation for future award redemptions using a deferred revenue model 

in the case of the sale of air services the company recognizes a portion of the ticket sales as revenue when the air transportation occurs and defers a portion of the ticket sale representing the value of the related miles as a multipledeliverable revenue arrangement the miles are recorded in frequent flyer deferred revenue on the company’s balance sheet and recognized into revenue when the transportation is provided 

the company determines the estimated selling price of air transportation and miles as if each element is sold on a separate basis the total consideration from each ticket sale is then allocated to each of these elements individually on a pro rata basis the company’s estimated selling price of miles prior to april 1 2014 was based on the price we sell miles to star alliance partners in our reciprocal frequent flyer agreements as the best estimate of selling price for these miles 

on march 30 2014 us airways exited star alliance effective with the exit date the company updated its estimated selling price for miles to a value based on the equivalent ticket value less fulfillment discount which incorporates the expected redemption of miles the equivalent ticket value used as the basis for the estimated selling price of miles is based on the prior 12 months’ weighted average equivalent ticket value of similar fares as those used to settle award redemptions while taking into consideration such factors as redemption pattern cabin class loyalty status and geographic region the estimated selling price of miles is adjusted by a fulfillment discount that considers a number of factors including redemption patterns of various customer groups this change in estimate was applied on a prospective basis beginning april 1 2014 the impact of this change resulted in an increase in consolidated revenue of approximately 95 million and an increase of approximately 026 per ual basic share and 024 per ual diluted share in 2014 

united has a significant contract to sell mileageplus miles to its cobranded credit card partner chase united identified five revenue elements in the cobrand agreement the air transportation element represented by the value of the mile generally resulting from its redemption for future air transportation and whose fair value is described above use of the united brand and access to mileageplus member lists advertising baggage services and airport lounge usage together excluding “the air transportation element” the “marketingrelated deliverables” 

the fair value of the elements is determined using management’s estimated selling price of each element the objective of using the estimated selling price based methodology is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis accordingly we determine our best estimate of selling price by considering multiple inputs and methods including but not limited to discounted cash flows brand value volume discounts published selling prices number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed the company estimated the selling prices and volumes over the term of the cobrand agreement in order to determine the allocation of proceeds to each of the multiple elements to be delivered the method for determining the selling price of the mile component changed march 30 2014 as described above we also evaluate volumes on an annual basis which may result in a change in the allocation of estimated selling price on a prospective basis 

the company accounts for miles sold and awarded that will never be redeemed by program members which we refer to as breakage the company reviews its breakage estimates annually based upon the latest available information regarding redemption and expiration patterns miles expire after 18 months of member account inactivity 

the company’s estimate of the expected expiration of miles requires significant management judgment current and future changes to expiration assumptions or to the expiration policy or to program rules and program redemption opportunities may result in material changes to the deferred revenue balance as well as recognized revenues from the programs 

  

the company records passenger revenue related to the air transportation element when the transportation is delivered the other elements are generally recognized as other operating revenue when earned 

the following table summarizes information related to the company’s frequent flyer deferred revenue liability 

 

 effective march 1 2015 the company will modify its mileageplus program for most tickets from the current model in which members earn redeemable miles based on distance traveled to one based on ticket price including base fare and carrier imposed surcharges members will be able to earn between five and eleven miles per dollar spent based on their mileageplus status the updated program will enhance the rewards for customers who spend more with united and give them improved mileageearning opportunities 

longlived assets the net book value of operating property and equipment for the company was 19 billion and 18 billion at december 31 2014 and december 31 2013 respectively the assets’ recorded value is impacted by a number of accounting policy elections including the estimation of useful lives and residual values and when necessary the recognition of asset impairment charges 

the company records assets acquired including aircraft at acquisition cost depreciable life is determined through economic analysis such as reviewing existing fleet plans obtaining appraisals and comparing estimated lives to other airlines that operate similar fleets as aircraft technology has improved useful life has increased and the company has generally estimated the lives of those aircraft to be 30 years residual values are estimated based on historical experience with regard to the sale of both aircraft and spare parts and are established in conjunction with the estimated useful lives of the related fleets residual values are based on when the aircraft are acquired and typically reflect asset values that have not reached the end of their physical life both depreciable lives and residual values are revised periodically as facts and circumstances arise to recognize changes in the company’s fleet plan and other relevant information a oneyear increase in the average depreciable life of the company’s flight equipment would reduce annual depreciation expense on flight equipment by approximately 50 million 

the company evaluates the carrying value of longlived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist for purposes of this testing the company has generally identified the aircraft fleet type as the lowest level of identifiable cash flows for purposes of testing aircraft for impairment an impairment charge is recognized when the asset’s carrying value exceeds its net undiscounted future cash flows and its fair market value the amount of the charge is the difference between the asset’s carrying value and fair market value 

defined benefit plan accounting we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees the most critical assumptions impacting our defined benefit pension plan obligations and expenses are the weighted average discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on the plan assets 

united’s pension plans’ underfunded status was 22 billion at december 31 2014 funding requirements for taxqualified defined benefit pension plans are determined by government regulations in 2015 we anticipate contributing at least 400 million to our pension plans substantially all of which is in excess of the minimum funding requirements the fair value of the plans’ assets was 26 billion at december 31 2014 

when calculating pension expense for 2015 the company assumed that its plans’ assets would generate a longterm rate of return of 736 the expected longterm rate of return assumption was developed based on historical experience and input from the trustee managing the plans’ assets the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of assets which is based on a goal of earning the highest rate of return while maintaining risk at acceptable levels our projected longterm rate of return reflects the active management of our plans’ assets the plans strive to have assets sufficiently diversified so that adverse or unexpected results 

  

from one security class will not have an unduly detrimental impact on the entire portfolio plan fiduciaries regularly review actual asset allocation and the pension plans’ investments are periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 

the defined benefit pension plans’ assets consist of return generating investments and risk mitigating investments which are held through direct ownership or through interests in common collective trusts return generating investments include primarily equity securities fixedincome securities and alternative investments eg private equity and hedge funds risk mitigating investments include primarily us government and investment grade corporate fixedincome securities the allocation of assets was as follows at december 31 2014 

 

 pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases lowering the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets by 50 basis points from 736 to 686 would increase estimated 2015 pension expense by approximately 13 million 

future pension obligations for united’s plans were discounted using a weighted average rate of 420 at december 31 2014 the company selected the 2014 discount rate for each of its plans by using a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds at december 31 2014 that would provide the necessary cash flows to match the projected benefit payments 

the pension liability and future pension expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points from 420 to 37 would increase the pension liability at december 31 2014 by approximately 532 million and increase the estimated 2015 pension expense by approximately 61 million 

future changes in plan asset returns plan provisions assumed discount rates pension funding law and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future 

actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions under the applicable accounting standards for defined benefit pension plans those gains and losses are not required to be recognized currently as pension benefit expense but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into expense over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees all gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are amortized to expense over the remaining years of service of the covered active employees at december 31 2014 and 2013 the company had unrecognized actuarial losses for pension benefit plans of 982 million and 162 million respectively recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 

during 2014 the company experienced changes in its benefit obligations related to changes in discount rates and mortality tables in its pension plans the company used the society of actuaries’ 2014 mortality tables modified to reflect the social security administration trustee’s report on current projections regarding expected longevity improvements see note 8 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information related to pension plans 

other postretirement benefit plan accounting united’s postretirement plan provides certain health care benefits primarily in the united states to retirees and eligible dependents as well as certain life insurance benefits to certain retirees reflected as “other benefits” united also has retiree medical programs that permit 

  

retirees who meet certain age and service requirements to continue medical coverage between retirement and medicare eligibility eligible employees are required to pay a portion of the costs of their retiree medical benefits which in some cases may be offset by accumulated unused sick time at the time of their retirement plan benefits are subject to copayments deductibles and other limits as described in the plans 

the company accounts for other postretirement benefits by recognizing the difference between plan assets and obligations or the plan’s funded status in its financial statements other postretirement benefit expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees’ approximate service periods and is generally calculated independently of funding decisions or requirements united has not been required to prefund its plan obligations which has resulted in a significant net obligation as discussed below the company’s benefit obligation was 21 billion and 18 billion for the other postretirement benefit plans at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively 

the calculation of other postretirement benefit expense and obligations requires the use of a number of assumptions including the assumed discount rate for measuring future payment obligations and the health care cost trend rate the company determines the appropriate discount rate for each of the plans based on current rates on high quality corporate bonds that would generate the cash flow necessary to pay plan benefits when due the company’s weighted average discount rate to determine its benefit obligations as of december 31 2014 was 407 as compared to 494 for december 31 2013 the health care cost trend rate assumed for 2014 was 725 declining to 50 in 2023 as compared to assumed trend rate for 2015 of 700 declining to 50 in 2023 a 1 increase in assumed health care trend rates would increase the company’s total service and interest cost for the year ended december 31 2014 by 13 million whereas a 1 decrease in assumed health care trend rates would decrease the company’s total service and interest cost for the year ended december 31 2014 by 11 million a one percentage point decrease in the weighted average discount rate would increase the company’s postretirement benefit liability by approximately 247 million and increase the estimated 2014 benefits expense by approximately 10 million 

actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions and prior service credits result from a retroactive reduction in benefits due under the plans under the applicable accounting standards for postretirement welfare benefit plans actuarial gains and losses and prior service credits are not required to be recognized currently but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into expense over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees or the average life expectancy of inactive participants at december 31 2014 and 2013 the company had unrecognized actuarial gains for postretirement welfare benefit plans of 233 million and 555 million respectively recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 

during 2014 the company experienced changes in its benefit obligations related to changes in discount rates and mortality tables in its other postretirement benefit plans the company used the society of actuaries’ 2014 mortality tables modified to reflect the social security administration trustee’s report on current projections regarding expected longevity improvements see note 8 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information related to other postretirement benefit plans 

income taxes our effective tax rates are lower than the federal statutory rate of 35 primarily because of the impact of changes to existing valuation allowances we continue to provide a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities because we have concluded that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will ultimately not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income including the reversals of deferred tax liabilities during the periods in which those deferred tax assets will become deductible the company’s management assesses available positive and negative evidence regarding the company’s ability to realize its deferred tax assets and records a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized to form a conclusion management considers positive evidence in the form of reversing temporary differences projections of future taxable income and tax planning strategies and negative evidence such as historical losses although the company was not in a threeyear cumulative loss position at the end of 2014 management determined that the low level of cumulative pretax income combined with uncertainty about forecasted results 

  

supports the conclusion that the valuation allowance is still necessary management will continue to evaluate future financial performance to determine whether such performance is both sustained and significant enough to provide sufficient evidence to support reversal of the valuation allowance if we reverse the valuation allowance we will begin to record income tax expense at an effective rate of approximately 37 however we will not pay significant cash taxes until we utilize our nol carryforward of 96 billion

additionally forwardlooking statements include statements which do not relate solely to historical facts such as statements which identify uncertainties or trends discuss the possible future effects of current known trends or uncertainties or which indicate that the future effects of known trends or uncertainties cannot be predicted guaranteed or assured all forwardlooking statements in this report are based upon information available to the company on the date of this report the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forwardlooking statement whether as a result of new information future events changed circumstances or otherwise except as required by applicable law 

the company’s actual results could differ materially from these forwardlooking statements due to numerous factors including without limitation the following its ability to comply with the terms of its various financing arrangements the costs and availability of financing its ability to maintain adequate liquidity its ability to execute its operational plans and revenuegenerating initiatives including optimizing its revenue its ability to control its costs including realizing benefits from its resource optimization efforts cost reduction initiatives and fleet replacement programs its ability to utilize its net operating losses its ability to attract and retain customers demand for transportation in the markets in which it operates an outbreak of a disease that affects travel demand or travel behavior demand for travel and the impact that global economic conditions have on customer travel patterns excessive taxation and the inability to offset future taxable income general economic conditions including interest rates foreign currency exchange rates investment or credit market conditions crude oil prices costs of aircraft fuel and energy refining capacity in relevant markets economic and political instability and other risks of doing business globally its ability to costeffectively hedge against increases in the price of aircraft fuel any potential realized or unrealized gains or losses related to fuel or currency hedging programs the effects of any hostilities act of war or terrorist attack the ability of other air carriers with whom the company has alliances or partnerships to provide the services contemplated by the respective arrangements with such carriers disruptions to its regional network the costs and availability of aviation and other insurance industry consolidation or changes in airline alliances competitive pressures on pricing and demand its capacity decisions and the capacity decisions of its competitors us or foreign governmental legislation regulation and other actions including open skies agreements and environmental regulations labor costs its ability to maintain satisfactory labor relations and the results of the collective bargaining agreement process with its union groups any disruptions to operations due to any potential actions by its labor groups weather conditions and other risks and uncertainties set forth under part i item 1a risk factors of this report as well as other risks and uncertainties set forth from time to time in the reports the company files with the sec

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend interest rates our net income loss is affected by fluctuations in interest rates eg interest expense on variable rate debt and interest income earned on shortterm investments the company’s policy is to manage interest rate risk through a combination of fixed and variable rate debt the following table summarizes information related to the company’s interest rate market risk at december 31 in millions 

 

 a change in market interest rates would also impact interest income earned on our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments assuming our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments remain at their average 2014 levels a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a corresponding increase in the company’s interest income of approximately 51 million during 2015 

commodity price risk aircraft fuel the price level of aircraft fuel can significantly affect the company’s operations results of operations financial position and liquidity 

to protect against increases in the prices of aircraft fuel the company routinely hedges a portion of its future fuel requirements the company generally uses financial hedge instruments including fixed price swaps purchased call options and commonly used combinations using put and call options including collars a sold put option combined with a purchased call option threeways a collar with a higher strike sold call option and fourway collars a collar with a higher strike sold call option and a lower strike purchased put option these hedge instruments are generally based on aircraft fuel or closely related commodities including diesel fuel and crude oil 

if the prices of the underlying commodity drop and stay below specified floor prices in some hedge contracts such as fixed price swaps and collars the company may incur losses however the negative impact of these losses would be significantly outweighed by the benefit of lower aircraft fuel cost since the company typically hedges only a portion of its future fuel requirements in addition the company continually monitors its portfolio of hedge contracts and may take actions to curtail or limit its losses from such hedge contracts if market conditions change the company does not enter into derivative instruments for nonrisk management purposes 

if fuel prices decline significantly from the levels existing at the time we enter into a hedge contract we may be required to post collateral margin with our hedge counterparties the company frequently monitors this margin risk and assesses the potential of depositing additional collateral with each of its counterparties at times when the fair market value of the company’s hedge contracts is net positive to the company it is exposed to the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to the hedge contract the company periodically monitors the credit worthiness of its counterparties requires its counterparties to post collateral above certain thresholds and generally limits its exposure to any single counterparty 

  

the company may adjust its hedging program based on changes in market conditions the following table summarizes information related to the company’s cost of fuel and hedging in millions except percentages 

 

  

a includes related taxes and excludes hedging impacts and special charges in 2013 the company’s fuel cost was 34 of total operating expenses 

b based on 2015 projected fuel consumption does not include the impact of fuel hedges 

c as of december 31 2013 the net fair value of the company’s fuel hedges was an asset of 104 million 

d based on fuel hedge positions at december 31 2014 

e assumes instantaneous change in prices and includes margin related to some hedge positions beyond december 31 2015 approximately 1 for 2016 

as of december 31 2014 the company had hedged approximately 22 and 1 of its projected fuel requirements 859 million and 35 million gallons respectively for 2015 and 2016 respectively with commonly used financial hedge instruments based on aircraft fuel or crude oil as of december 31 2014 the company had fuel hedges expiring through march 2016 

the fuel hedge portfolio is comprised of many individual hedge contracts primarily option contracts on multiple underlying commodities and entered into at various points in time resulting in a wide range of strike prices with several hedge counterparties the table below provides a view of the economic impact of the hedge portfolio on the company’s 2015 fuel costs given significant moves up to 30 in market fuel prices from december 31 2014 in millions 

 

   

foreign currency the company generates revenues and incurs expenses in numerous foreign currencies changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the company’s results of operations through changes in the dollar value of foreign currencydenominated operating revenues and expenses some of the company’s more significant foreign currency exposures include the canadian dollar chinese renminbi european euro and japanese yen at times the company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency the company does not enter into derivative instruments for nonrisk management purposes at december 31 2014 the company had forward contracts and collars outstanding to hedge 60 of its projected european eurodenominated net cash inflows primarily from passenger ticket sales through the end of 2015 

the result of a uniform 10 percent strengthening in the value of the us dollar from december 31 2014 levels relative to each of the currencies in which the company has foreign currency exposure would result in a decrease in pretax income of approximately 262 million for the year ending december 31 2015 this sensitivity analysis was prepared based upon projected 2015 foreign currencydenominated revenues and expenses as of december 31 2014 and reflects the potential benefit of the european euro hedges mentioned above

operations 

network the company transports people and cargo through its mainline operations which use jet aircraft with at least 118 seats and its regional operations see part i item 2 properties for a description of the company’s mainline and regional aircraft 

  

with key global air rights in the united states asiapacific europe middle east africa and latin america ual has the world’s most comprehensive global route network ual through united and its regional carriers operates an average of more than 5300 flights a day to more than 360 airports across six continents from the company’s hubs at newark liberty international airport “newark liberty” chicago o’hare international airport “chicago o’hare” denver international airport “denver” george bush intercontinental airport “houston bush” hopkins international airport “cleveland” los angeles international airport “lax” ab won pat international airport “guam” san francisco international airport “sfo” and washington dulles international airport “washington dulles” in february 2014 the company announced that it would be reducing its flying from cleveland in stages beginning in april 2014 see part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 2014 outlook of this report for additional information on cleveland 

all of the company’s domestic hubs are located in large business and population centers contributing to a large amount of “origin and destination” traffic the hub and spoke system allows us to transport passengers between a large number of destinations with substantially more frequent service than if each route were served directly the hub system also allows us to add service to a new destination from a large number of cities using only one or a limited number of aircraft as discussed under alliances below united is a member of star alliance the world’s largest airline network 

regional the company has contractual relationships with various regional carriers to provide regional jet and turboprop service branded as united express these regional operations are an extension of the company’s mainline network this regional service complements our operations by carrying traffic that connects to our mainline service and allows flights to smaller cities that cannot be provided economically with mainline aircraft chautauqua airlines republic airlines commutair airlines expressjet airlines gojet airlines mesa airlines shuttle america skywest airlines “skywest” and trans states airlines “trans states” are all regional carriers which operate most of their capacity contracted to united under capacity purchase agreements “cpas” with united under these cpas the company pays the regional carriers contractuallyagreed fees carriercontrolled costs for operating these flights plus a variable reimbursement incentive payment for superior operational performance based on agreed performance metrics the fees for carriercontrolled costs are based on specific rates for various operating expenses of the regional carriers such as crew expenses maintenance and aircraft ownership some of which are multiplied by specific operating statistics eg block hours departures while others are fixed monthly amounts under these cpas the company is responsible for all fuel costs incurred as well as landing fees facilities rent and other costs which are passed through by the regional carrier to the company without any markup in return the regional carriers operate this capacity exclusively for united on schedules determined by the company the company also determines pricing and revenue management assumes the inventory and distribution risk for the available seats and permits mileage accrual and redemption for regional flights through its mileageplus loyalty program 

while the regional carriers operating under cpas comprise more than 95 of all regional flights the company also has prorate agreements with hyannis air service inc “cape air” silver airways “silver” skywest and trans states under these commercial flying agreements the company and its regional carriers agree to divide revenue collected from each passenger according to a formula while both the company and its regional carriers are individually responsible for their own costs of operations unlike cpas under a prorate agreement the regional carrier retains the control and risk of scheduling and in most cases market selection local seat pricing and inventory for its flights although the company and its regional carriers may coordinate schedules to maximize connections 

financial information on the company’s operating revenues by geographic regions as reported to the us department of transportation the “dot” can be found in note 18 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

alliances united has a number of strategic bilateral and multilateral alliances with other airlines including marketing alliances and joint ventures which enhance travel options for customers by providing greater time of 

  

day coverage to common destinations additional mileage accrual and redemption opportunities and expanded global network access these marketing alliances typically include one or more of the following features loyalty program reciprocity codesharing of flight operations whereby seats on one carrier’s selected flights can be marketed under the brand name of another carrier coordination of reservations ticketing passenger checkin baggage handling airport lounge access and flight schedules and other resourcesharing activities that include joint sales and marketing 

united is a member of star alliance a global integrated airline network cofounded by united in 1997 and the largest and most comprehensive airline alliance in the world as of january 1 2014 star alliance carriers served 1328 airports in 195 countries with over 21900 daily flights current star alliance members in addition to united are adria airways aegean airlines air canada air china air new zealand all nippon airways “ana” asiana airlines austrian airlines avianca brussels airlines copa airlines croatia airlines egyptair ethiopian airlines eva air lot polish airlines lufthansa sas scandinavian airlines shenzhen airlines singapore airlines south african airways swiss tam airlines “tam” tap portugal thai airways international turkish airlines and us airways on december 9 2013 us airways and american airlines closed their merger transaction and as a result we anticipate us airways will exit star alliance on march 30 2014 latam airlines group the parent company of tam following tam’s merger with lan airlines announced that tam would exit star alliance at a future date expected in early 2014 in addition in late 2013 star alliance announced it would recommence integration activities with air india following the cessation of such activities in july 2011 a joining date for air india has yet to be determined 

united has a variety of bilateral commercial alliance agreements and obligations with star alliance members addressing among other things reciprocal earning redemption of frequent flyer miles and access to airport lounges and with certain star alliance members codesharing of flight operations in addition to the alliance agreements with star alliance members united currently maintains independent marketing alliance agreements with other air carriers currently unaffiliated with a global alliance including aeromar aer lingus cape air great lakes airlines silver hawaiian airlines island air and jet airways united also offers a traintoplane alliance with amtrak from newark liberty to select regional destinations 

united also participates in joint ventures one with air canada and the lufthansa group which includes lufthansa and its affiliates austrian airlines brussels airlines and swiss covering transatlantic routes and another with ana covering certain transpacific routes these joint ventures enable the participating carriers to integrate the services they provide in the respective regions capturing revenue synergies and delivering highly competitive flight schedules fares and services the european commission conducted a standard review of the competitive effects of united’s transatlantic joint venture and closed its review in may 2013 

loyalty program united’s mileageplus program builds customer loyalty by offering awards and services to program participants members in this program earn mileage credit for flights on united united express airlines in star alliance and certain other airlines that participate in the program members can also earn miles by purchasing the goods and services of our network of nonairline partners such as credit card issuers retail merchants hotels and car rental companies members can redeem mileage credits for free other than taxes and government imposed fees discounted or upgraded travel and nontravel awards 

under the company’s consolidated amended and restated cobranded card marketing services agreement the “cobrand agreement” with chase bank usa na “chase” loyalty program members accrue frequent flyer miles for making purchases using cobranded credit cards issued by chase the cobrand agreement provides for joint marketing of the company’s credit card program and provides chase with other benefits such as permission to market to the company’s customer database 

five million and 47 million mileageplus flight awards were used on united in 2013 and 2012 respectively these awards represented 77 and 71 of united’s total revenue passenger miles in 2013 and 2012 respectively total miles redeemed for flights on united in 2013 including classofservice upgrades represented approximately 80 of the total miles redeemed 

  

in addition excluding miles redeemed for flights on united mileageplus members redeemed miles for approximately two million other awards in 2013 as compared to 16 million in 2012 these awards include united club memberships car and hotel awards merchandise and flights on other air carriers 

fuel aircraft fuel has been the company’s single largest operating expense for the last several years the table below summarizes ual’s aircraft fuel consumption and expense during the last three years 

 

  

a calculation excludes special charges identified in note 17 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report 

the availability and price of aircraft fuel significantly affect the company’s operations results of operations financial position and liquidity to provide adequate supplies of fuel the company routinely enters into shortterm and longterm purchase contracts and has some ability to store fuel close to its major hub locations to protect against increases in the prices of aircraft fuel the company routinely hedges a portion of its future fuel requirements the company generally uses commonly used financial hedge instruments based on aircraft fuel or closely related commodities including diesel fuel and crude oil 

thirdparty business united generates thirdparty business revenue that includes fuel sales catering ground handling maintenance services and frequent flyer award nonair redemptions and thirdparty business revenue is recorded in other operating revenue the company has a contract to sell aircraft fuel to a third party that results in revenue and expense which is unrelated to the operation of the airline united also incurs thirdparty business expenses such as maintenance ground handling and catering services for third parties fuel sales and nonair mileage redemptions and those thirdparty business expenses are recorded in other operating expenses 

distribution channels the majority of the company’s airline seat inventory continues to be distributed through the traditional channels of travel agencies and global distribution systems “gds” the use of the company’s direct sales website unitedcom the company’s mobile applications and alternative distribution systems provides the company with an opportunity to decommoditize its services better control its content make more targeted offerings better retain its customers enhance its brand and lower its ticket distribution costs to encourage customer use of lowercost channels and capitalize on these costsaving opportunities the company will continue to expand the capabilities of its website and mobile applications and explore alternative distribution channels 

industry conditions 

domestic competition the domestic airline industry is highly competitive and dynamic currently any us carrier deemed fit by the dot is free to operate scheduled passenger service between any two points within the united states the company’s competitors consist primarily of other airlines and to a lesser extent other forms of transportation competition can be direct in the form of another carrier flying the exact nonstop route or indirect where a carrier serves the same two cities nonstop from an alternative airport in that city or via an itinerary requiring a connection at another airport 

air carriers’ cost structures are not uniform and there are numerous factors influencing cost structure carriers with lower costs may deliver lower fares to passengers which could have a potential negative impact on the company’s revenues in addition future airline mergers acquisitions or reorganizations pursuant to chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code may enable airlines to improve their revenue and cost performance relative to peers and thus enhance their competitive position within the industry 

  

decisions on domestic pricing are based on intense competitive pressure exerted on the company by other us airlines in order to remain competitive and maintain passenger traffic levels we often find it necessary to match competitors’ discounted fares since we compete in a dynamic marketplace attempts to generate additional revenue through increased fares oftentimes fail 

international competition internationally the company competes not only with us airlines but also with foreign carriers international competition has increased and may increase in the future as a result of airline mergers and acquisitions joint ventures alliances restructurings liberalization of aviation bilateral agreements and new or increased service by competitors competition on international routes is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation the company’s ability to compete successfully with nonus carriers on international routes depends in part on its ability to generate traffic to and from the entire united states via its integrated domestic route network and its ability to overcome business and operational challenges across its network worldwide foreign carriers currently are prohibited by us law from carrying local passengers between two points in the united states and the company experiences comparable restrictions in foreign countries except where “fifth freedom rights” have been negotiated between the us government and other countries in addition in the absence of open skies and fifth freedom rights us carriers are constrained from carrying passengers to points beyond designated international gateway cities due to limitations in air service agreements and restrictions imposed unilaterally by foreign governments to compensate partially for these structural limitations us and foreign carriers have entered into alliances joint ventures and marketing arrangements that enable these carriers to exchange traffic between each other’s flights and route networks see alliances above for further information 

seasonality the air travel business is subject to seasonal fluctuations historically demand for air travel is higher in the second and third quarters driving higher revenues than in the first and fourth quarters which are periods of lower travel demand 

industry regulation 

domestic regulation 

general all carriers engaged in air transportation in the united states are subject to regulation by the dot absent an exemption no air carrier may provide air transportation of passengers or property without first being issued a dot certificate of public convenience and necessity the dot also grants international route authority approves international codeshare arrangements and regulates methods of competition the dot regulates consumer protection and maintains jurisdiction over advertising denied boarding compensation tarmac delays baggage liability and other areas and may add additional expensive regulatory burdens in the future the dot’s series of rules to enhance airline passenger protections have required us air carriers to adopt contingency plans and procedures for tarmac delays exceeding three hours for domestic flights and four hours for international flights and to charge the same baggage fee throughout a passenger’s entire itinerary even if on multiple carriers 

airlines are also regulated by the federal aviation administration the “faa” an agency within the dot primarily in the areas of flight safety air carrier operations and aircraft maintenance and airworthiness the faa issues air carrier operating certificates and aircraft airworthiness certificates prescribes maintenance procedures oversees airport operations and regulates pilot and other employee training the 2011 faa final rule amending existing flight duty and rest regulations applicable to us air carriers under part 117 of the federal aviation regulations which took effect on january 4 2014 mandates extensive changes to the way the company schedules crews and deploys aircraft from time to time the faa issues directives that require air carriers to inspect or modify aircraft and other equipment potentially causing the company to incur substantial unplanned expenses the airline industry is also subject to numerous other federal laws and regulations the us department of homeland security has jurisdiction over virtually every aspect of civil aviation security beginning in march 2014 the occupation safety and health administration “osha” will extend its regulatory programs for hazard communication hearing conservation and blood borne pathogens to areas of cabin crewmember safety and health the antitrust division of the us department of justice “doj” has jurisdiction 

  

over certain airline competition matters the us postal service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail by airlines labor relations in the airline industry are generally governed by the railway labor act “rla” a federal statute the company is also subject to investigation inquiries by the dot faa doj and other us and international regulatory bodies 

airport access access to landing and takeoff rights or “slots” at several major us airports and many foreign airports served by the company are or recently have been subject to government regulation federally mandated domestic slot restrictions currently apply at reagan national airport in washington dc john f kennedy international airport “jfk” laguardia airport “laguardia” and newark liberty in addition to address concerns about airport congestion the faa has designated certain airports including newark liberty jfk and laguardia as “high density traffic airports” and has imposed operating restrictions at these three airports which may include capacity reductions additional restrictions on airline routes and takeoff and landing slots at these and other airports may be proposed in the future that could affect the company’s rights of ownership and transfer 

legislation the airline industry is subject to legislative activity that may have an impact on operations and costs in addition to significant federal state and local taxes and fees that the company is currently subject to proposed taxes and fees are currently pending that may increase the company’s operating costs if imposed on the company congress may pass legislation that could increase labor and operating costs the airline safety and federal aviation extension act of 2010 and the faa modernization and reform act of 2012 have increased regulation and are likely to cause increased costs in the areas of airline safety pilot training and consumer protection climate change legislation is also likely to be a significant area of legislative and regulatory focus and could adversely impact the company’s costs see environmental regulation  below 

finally aviation security continues to be the subject of frequent legislative and regulatory action requiring changes to the company’s security processes frequently increasing the cost of its security procedures and adversely affecting its operations 

international regulation 

general international air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation in connection with the company’s international services the company is regulated by both the us government and the governments of the foreign countries the company serves in addition the availability of international routes to us carriers is regulated by aviation agreements between the us and foreign governments and in some cases fares and schedules require the approval of the dot andor the relevant foreign governments 

legislation foreign countries are increasingly enacting passenger protection laws rules and regulations that meet or exceed us requirements in cases where this activity exceeds us requirements additional burden and liability may be placed on the company the european union “eu” requires compensation to passengers under many circumstances for canceled and delayed flights in addition to denied boarding compensation similar regulations in other countries require passenger compensation and subject the company to enforcement penalties in addition to changes in operating procedures 

airport access historically access to foreign markets has been tightly controlled through bilateral agreements between the us and each foreign country involved these agreements regulate the markets served the number of carriers allowed to serve each market and the frequency of carriers’ flights since the early 1990s the us has pursued a policy of “open skies” meaning all usflag carriers have access to the destination under which the us government has negotiated a number of bilateral agreements allowing unrestricted access between us and foreign markets currently there are more than 100 open skies agreements in effect however many of the airports that the company serves in europe asia and latin america maintain slot controls a large number of these are restrictive due to congestion at these airports london heathrow international airport frankfurt rheinmain airport shanghai pudong international airport beijing capital international airport sao paulo guarulhos international airport and tokyo haneda international airport are among the most restrictive foreign airports due to capacity limitations as an example under the 2010 united statesjapan open skies agreement only four slot pairs are available in haneda to us air carriers at this time none of which is held by the company 

  

the company’s ability to serve some foreign markets and expand into certain others is limited by the absence of aviation agreements between the us government and the relevant foreign governments shifts in us or foreign government aviation policies may lead to the alteration or termination of air service agreements depending on the nature of any such change the value of the company’s international route authorities and slot rights may be materially enhanced or diminished 

environmental regulation 

general the airline industry is subject to increasingly stringent federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations concerning emissions to the air discharges to surface and subsurface waters safe drinking water aircraft noise and the management of hazardous substances oils and waste materials areas of either proposed regulations or implementation of new regulations include regulations surrounding climate change discussed further below state of california regulations regarding air emissions from ground support equipment and a federal rulemaking seeking to regulate airport fuel hydrant systems under the underground storage tank regulations 

climate change there are certain laws and regulations relating to climate change that apply to the company including the european union’s emissions trading scheme “eu ets” environmental taxes for certain international flights including germany’s departure ticket tax greenhouse gas reporting requirements and the state of california’s cap and trade regulations that impact united’s san francisco maintenance center in addition there are landbased planning laws that could apply to airport expansion projects requiring a review of carbon emissions and could affect airlines in certain circumstances 

the 2009 eu directive to include aviation carbon emissions from flights to and from the eu in the eu ets has been the subject of significant international dispute among countries including the united states in response to the directive the european union emissions trading scheme prohibition act of 2011 directed the dot to seek an international solution regarding aviation carbon emissions through the international civil aviation organization “icao” and if necessary to prohibit us airlines from participation in the eu ets and hold the airlines harmless from the scheme in april 2013 to give icao an opportunity to reach international agreement the eu approved a one year stay such that the requirements of the eu ets would apply only to intraeu flights 

in october 2013 icao adopted a resolution establishing the path for development of a global marketbased measure to regulate international aviation carbon emissions for final approval by icao in 2016 the cost to the company of any such global measure is not known at this time the same resolution requires that any individual country or region that regulates carbon emissions from international aviation seek agreement through multilateral negotiations also in october 2013 the eu proposed changes to the eu ets contrary to the icao resolution that regulate a portion of carbon emissions from international flights arriving in or departing from an eu airport the precise cost to the company should these proposed changes to the eu ets be finalized is difficult to calculate due to a number of variables including the undetermined methodology for calculating the portion of emissions to be regulated the company’s future carbon emissions the price of carbon credits that the company would purchase under the eu ets and whether the dot would take action under the european union emissions trading scheme prohibition act of 2011 the company is taking various actions to reduce its carbon emissions through fleet renewal aircraft retrofits and actions that are establishing the foundation for the commercialization of aviation alternative fuels 

other environmental matters some us and foreign airports have established airport restrictions to limit noise including restrictions on aircraft types and operating times in some instances these restrictions have caused curtailments in services or increased operating costs and could limit our ability to expand our operations at the affected airports the company is engaged in a number of geographic locations where changes to existing noise policies are being considered 

the airline industry is also subject to other environmental laws and regulations that require the company to remediate soil or groundwater to meet certain objectives and which may require significant expenditures under the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as “superfund” and similar environmental cleanup laws generators of waste materials and owners or operators of 

  

facilities can be subject to liability for investigation and remediation costs at locations that have been identified as requiring response actions the company also conducts voluntary environmental assessment and remediation actions environmental cleanup obligations can arise from among other circumstances the operation of aircraft fueling facilities and primarily involve airport sites future costs associated with these activities are currently not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

employees 

as of december 31 2013 ual including its subsidiaries had approximately 87000 employees approximately 80 of the company’s employees were represented by various us labor organizations as of december 31 2013 

collective bargaining agreements between the company and its represented employee groups are negotiated under the rla such agreements typically do not contain an expiration date and instead specify an amendable date upon which the contract is considered “open for amendment” the company continues to integrate its remaining employee groups in connection with the merger such process being governed by a combination of the rla the mccaskillbond amendment and where applicable the existing provisions of united’s collective bargaining agreements and union policies 

the following table reflects the company’s represented employee groups number of employees per represented group union representation for each of united’s employee groups where applicable amendable date for each employee group’s collective bargaining agreement and whether the group is engaged in negotiations for a joint collective bargaining agreement 

 

  

a the table includes the company’s us based and guam union represented employees only 

b the respective amendable dates for those joint negotiations in progress reflect the remaining united continental andor continental micronesia inc “cmi” standalone agreements 

the company cannot predict the outcome of negotiations with its unionized employee groups although significant increases in the pay and benefits resulting from new collective bargaining agreements would have an adverse financial impact on the company see notes 15 and 17 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for more information on labor negotiations and costs 

  

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend the following risk factors should be read carefully when evaluating the company’s business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this report and other statements the company or its representatives make from time to time any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect the company’s business operating results financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this report 

continued periods of historically high fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a material adverse impact on the company’s operating results financial position and liquidity 

aircraft fuel has been the company’s single largest operating expense for the last several years the availability and price of aircraft fuel significantly affect the company’s operations results of operations financial position and liquidity while the company has been able to obtain adequate supplies of fuel under various supply contracts and has some ability to store fuel close to major hub locations to ensure supply continuity in the short term the company cannot predict the continued future availability or price of aircraft fuel 

continued volatility in fuel prices may negatively impact the company’s liquidity or financial position in the future aircraft fuel prices can fluctuate based on a multitude of factors including market expectations of supply and demand balance inventory levels geopolitical events economic growth expectations fiscalmonetary policies and financial investment flows the company may not be able to increase its fares or other fees if fuel prices rise in the future and any such fare or fee increases may not be sustainable in the highly competitive airline industry in addition any increases in fares or other fees may not sufficiently offset the full impact of such increases in fuel prices and may also reduce the general demand for air travel 

to protect against increases in the prices of aircraft fuel the company routinely hedges a portion of its future fuel requirements however the company’s hedging program may not be successful in controlling fuel costs and price protection provided may be limited due to market conditions and other factors to the extent that the company uses hedge contracts that have the potential to create an obligation to pay upon settlement if prices decline significantly including swaps or sold put options as part of a collar such hedge contracts may limit the company’s ability to benefit from lower fuel costs in the future if fuel prices decline significantly from the levels existing at the time we enter into a hedge contract we may be required to post collateral margin with our hedge counterparties beyond certain thresholds also lower fuel prices may result in increased industry capacity and lower fares in general there can be no assurance that the company’s hedging arrangements will provide any particular level of protection against rises in fuel prices or that its counterparties will be able to perform under the company’s hedging arrangements additionally deterioration in the company’s financial condition could negatively affect its ability to enter into new hedge contracts in the future and may potentially require the company to post increased amounts of collateral under its fuel hedging agreements 

in addition the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 and regulations promulgated by the commodity futures trading commission the “cftc” require centralized clearing for overthecounter derivatives and recordkeeping and reporting requirements that are applicable to the company’s fuel hedge contracts the ual board of directors “board of directors” has approved the company’s election of the cftc’s enduser exception which permits the company as a nonfinancial end user of derivatives to hedge commercial risk and be exempt from the cftc mandatory clearing requirements however several of the company’s hedge counterparties are also subject to these requirements which may raise the counterparties’ costs those increased costs may in turn be passed on to the company resulting in increased transaction costs to execute hedge contracts and lower credit thresholds to post collateral margin 

see note 10 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information on the company’s hedging programs 

  

economic and industry conditions constantly change and unfavorable global economic conditions may have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations 

the company’s business and results of operations are significantly impacted by general economic and industry conditions the airline industry is highly cyclical and the level of demand for air travel is correlated to the strength of the us and global economies robust demand for our air transportation services depends largely on favorable economic conditions including the strength of the domestic and foreign economies low unemployment levels strong consumer confidence levels and the availability of consumer and business credit 

air transportation is often a discretionary purchase that leisure travelers may limit or eliminate during difficult economic times in addition during periods of unfavorable economic conditions business travelers usually reduce the volume of their travel either due to costsaving initiatives or as a result of decreased business activity requiring travel during such periods the company’s business and results of operations may be adversely affected due to significant declines in industry passenger demand particularly with respect to the company’s business and premium cabin travelers and a reduction in fare levels 

stagnant or weakening global economic conditions either in the united states or in other geographic regions and any future volatility in us and global financial and credit markets may have a material adverse effect on the company’s revenues results of operations and liquidity if such economic conditions were to disrupt capital markets in the future the company may be unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all to refinance certain maturing debt and to satisfy future capital commitments 

the company is subject to economic and political instability and other risks of doing business globally 

the company is a global business with operations outside of the united states from which it derives approximately 40 of its operating revenues as measured and reported to the dot the company’s operations in asia europe latin america africa and the middle east are a vital part of its worldwide airline network volatile economic political and market conditions in these international regions may have a negative impact on the company’s operating results and its ability to achieve its business objectives in addition significant or volatile changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies and the imposition of exchange controls or other currency restrictions may have a material adverse impact upon the company’s liquidity revenues costs and operating results 

inadequate liquidity or a negative impact on the company’s liquidity from factors beyond the company’s control may have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position and business 

the company has a significant amount of financial leverage from fixed obligations including aircraft lease and debt financings leases of airport property and other facilities and other material cash obligations in addition the company has substantial noncancelable commitments for capital expenditures including the acquisition of new aircraft and related spare engines 

although the company’s cash flows from operations and its available capital including the proceeds from financing transactions have been sufficient to meet these obligations and commitments to date the company’s future liquidity could be negatively impacted by the risk factors discussed in this item 1a including but not limited to substantial volatility in the price of fuel adverse economic conditions disruptions in the global capital markets and catastrophic external events 

if the company’s liquidity is constrained due to the various risk factors noted in this item 1a or otherwise the company might not be able to timely pay its debts or comply with certain operating and financial covenants under its financing and credit card processing agreements or with other material provisions of its contractual obligations these covenants require the company or united as applicable to maintain minimum liquidity andor minimum collateral coverage ratios depending on the particular agreement the company’s ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond its control including the overall industry revenue environment the level of fuel costs and the appraised value of certain collateral 

  

if the company does not timely pay its debts or comply with such covenants a variety of adverse consequences could result these potential adverse consequences include an increase of required reserves under credit card processing agreements withholding of credit card sale proceeds by its credit card service providers loss of undrawn lines of credit occurrence of an event of default under the relevant agreements acceleration of the maturity of debt andor exercise of other remedies by its creditors and equipment lessors that could result in a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations the company cannot provide assurance that it would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance such debt if it were accelerated in addition an event of default or declaration of acceleration under certain of its financing agreements could result in an event of default under certain of the company’s other financing agreements due to cross default and cross acceleration provisions 

furthermore constrained liquidity may limit the company’s ability to withstand competitive pressures and limit its flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions including increased competition and demand for new services placing the company at a disadvantage when compared to its competitors that have less debt and making the company more vulnerable than its competitors who have less debt to a downturn in the business industry or the economy in general 

the company’s substantial level of indebtedness and noninvestment grade credit rating as well as market conditions and the availability of assets as collateral for loans or other indebtedness may make it difficult for the company to raise additional capital to meet its liquidity needs on acceptable terms or at all 

see part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report for further information regarding the company’s liquidity 

extensive government regulation could increase the company’s operating costs and restrict its ability to conduct its business 

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal oversight compliance with us and international regulations imposes significant costs and may have adverse effects on the company laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges both domestically and internationally have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce airline revenue the company cannot provide any assurance that current laws and regulations or laws or regulations enacted in the future will not adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations 

united provides air transportation under certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by the dot if the dot altered amended modified suspended or revoked these certificates it could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business the dot is also responsible for promulgating consumer protection and other regulations such as the rule against lengthy tarmac delays that will impose significant compliance costs on the company the faa regulates the safety of united’s operations united operates pursuant to an air carrier operating certificate issued by the faa on january 4 2014 the faa’s new and more stringent pilot flight and duty time requirements under part 117 of the federal aviation regulations took effect which will disrupt operations and increase costs in august 2013 the faa significantly increased the minimum qualifications for air carrier first officers these new regulations impact the company and its regional partner flying as they have caused mainline airlines to hire regional pilots while simultaneously significantly reducing the pool of new pilots from which regional carriers themselves can hire although this is an industry issue it directly affects the company and requires it to reduce regional partner flying as several regional partners are beginning to have difficulty flying their schedules due to reduced new pilot availability from time to time the faa also issues orders airworthiness directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require material expenditures or operational restrictions by the company these faa orders and directives could include the temporary grounding of an entire aircraft type if the faa identifies design manufacturing maintenance or other issues requiring immediate corrective action faa requirements cover among other things retirement of older aircraft security measures collision avoidance systems airborne windshear avoidance systems noise abatement and other environmental concerns aircraft operation and safety and increased inspections and maintenance procedures to be conducted on older aircraft these faa directives or requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company also beginning in march 2014 osha’s regulatory 

  

programs for hazard communication hearing conservation and blood borne pathogens in the areas of cabin crewmember safety and health is expected to expose the company to increased regulatory requirements in the aircraft cabin with associated increased costs and the possibility for operational impacts 

in addition the company’s operations may be adversely impacted due to the existing antiquated air traffic control “atc” system utilized by the us government during peak travel periods in certain markets the current atc system’s inability to handle existing travel demand has led to shortterm capacity constraints imposed by government agencies and resulted in delays and disruptions of air traffic in addition the current system will not be able to effectively handle projected future air traffic growth imposition of these atc constraints on a longterm basis may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations failure to update the atc system in a timely manner and the substantial funding requirements of a modernized atc system that may be imposed on air carriers may have an adverse impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

the airline industry is subject to extensive federal state and local taxes and fees that increase the cost of the company’s operations in addition to taxes and fees that the company is currently subject to proposed taxes and fees are currently pending and if imposed would increase the company’s operating expenses the bipartisan budget act of 2013 signed into law on december 26 2013 increases the september 11 th security fee effective july 1 2014 the increase is expected to result in over 3 billion in additional taxation on the industry over the next decade and may result in higher fares and lower demand for air travel 

access to landing and takeoff rights or “slots” at several major us airports and many foreign airports served by the company are or recently have been subject to government regulation certain of the company’s major hubs are among increasingly congested airports in the united states and have been or could be the subject of regulatory action that might limit the number of flights andor increase costs of operations at certain times or throughout the day the faa may limit the company’s airport access by limiting the number of departure and arrival slots at high density traffic airports which could affect the company’s ownership and transfer rights and local airport authorities may have the ability to control access to certain facilities or the cost of access to its facilities which could have an adverse effect on the company’s business the faa historically has taken actions with respect to airlines’ slot holdings that airlines have challenged if the faa were to take actions that adversely affect the company’s slot holdings the company could incur substantial costs to preserve its slots further the company’s operating costs at airports at which it operates including the company’s major hubs may increase significantly because of capital improvements at such airports that the company may be required to fund directly or indirectly in some circumstances such costs could be imposed by the relevant airport authority without the company’s approval and may have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition 

the ability of carriers to operate flights on international routes between airports in the united states and other countries may be subject to change applicable arrangements between the united states and foreign governments may be amended from time to time government policies with respect to airport operations may be revised and the availability of appropriate slots or facilities may change the company currently operates a number of flights on international routes under government arrangements regulations or policies that designate the number of carriers permitted to operate on such routes the capacity of the carriers providing services on such routes the airports at which carriers may operate international flights or the number of carriers allowed access to particular airports any further limitations additions or modifications to such arrangements regulations or policies could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations additionally a change in law regulation or policy for any of the company’s international routes such as open skies could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial position and results of operations and could result in the impairment of material amounts of related tangible and intangible assets in addition competition from revenuesharing joint ventures and other alliance arrangements by and among other airlines could impair the value of the company’s business and assets on the open skies routes the company’s plans to enter into or expand us antitrust immunized alliances and joint ventures on various international routes are subject to receipt of approvals from applicable us federal authorities and obtaining other applicable foreign government clearances or 

  

satisfying the necessary applicable regulatory requirements there can be no assurance that such approvals and clearances will be granted or will continue in effect upon further regulatory review or that changes in regulatory requirements or standards can be satisfied 

many aspects of the company’s operations are also subject to increasingly stringent federal state local and international laws protecting the environment future environmental regulatory developments such as climate change regulations in the united states and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in the airline industry there are certain climate change laws and regulations that have already gone into effect and that apply to the company including the eu ets which is subject to international dispute the state of california’s cap and trade regulations environmental taxes for certain international flights limited greenhouse gas reporting requirements and landuse planning laws which could apply to airports and could affect airlines in certain circumstances in addition there is the potential for additional regulatory actions in regard to the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry the precise nature of future requirements and their applicability to the company are difficult to predict but the financial impact to the company and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant 

the company’s business and operations may also be impacted by a lack of funding and in turn sequestration procedures at the federal government level in april 2013 for example the faa implemented furloughs of air traffic controllers through its capacity reduction plan resulting in flight delays throughout the united states including to the company’s flights until the us congress passed a bill suspending such furloughs although the us congress allocated resources under the bipartisan budget act of 2013 that is expected to be in effect for the 2014 and 2015 fiscal years the risk of future lack of funding and related sequestration obligations by the faa the transportation security administration the us customs and border protection or other federal agencies remains potentially resulting in a material adverse impact on the company 

see part i item 1 business  industry regulation of this report for further information on government regulation impacting the company 

the company relies heavily on technology and automated systems to operate its business and any significant failure or disruption of the technology or these systems could materially harm its business 

the company depends on automated systems and technology to operate its business including computerized airline reservation systems flight operations systems revenue management systems accounting systems telecommunication systems and commercial websites including wwwunitedcom united’s website and other automated systems must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic maintain secure information and deliver important flight and schedule information as well as process critical financial transactions these systems could suffer substantial or repeated disruptions due to various events some of which are beyond the company’s control including natural disasters power failures terrorist attacks equipment or software failures computer viruses or cyber security attacks substantial or repeated systems failures or disruptions including failures or disruptions related to the company’s complex integration of systems could reduce the attractiveness of the company’s services versus those of its competitors materially impair its ability to market its services and operate its flights result in the unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information result in increased costs lost revenue and the loss or compromise of important data and may adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the company is subject to increasing legislative and regulatory and customer focus on privacy issues and data security 

the company is subject to increasing legislative and regulatory and customer focus on privacy issues and data security a number of our commercial partners including credit card companies have imposed data security standards that the company must meet and these standards continue to evolve the company will continue its efforts to meet new and increasing privacy and security standards however it is possible that certain new standards may be difficult to meet and could increase the company’s costs additionally any compromise of the company’s technology systems could result in the loss disclosure misappropriation of or access to customers’ 

  

employees’ or business partners’ information any such loss disclosure misappropriation or access could result in legal claims or proceedings liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information any significant data breach or the company’s failure to comply with applicable us and foreign privacy or data security regulations or security standards imposed by our commercial partners may adversely affect the company’s reputation business results of operations and financial condition 

the company’s business relies extensively on thirdparty service providers failure of these parties to perform as expected or interruptions in the company’s relationships with these providers or their provision of services to the company could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the company has engaged an increasing number of thirdparty service providers to perform a large number of functions that are integral to its business including regional operations operation of customer service call centers distribution and sale of airline seat inventory provision of information technology infrastructure and services provision of aircraft maintenance and repairs provision of various utilities and performance of aircraft fueling operations among other vital functions and services the company does not directly control these thirdparty service providers although it does enter into agreements with many of them that define expected service performance any of these thirdparty service providers however may materially fail to meet their service performance commitments to the company may suffer disruptions to their systems that could impact their services or the agreements with such providers may be terminated for example flight reservations booked by customers andor travel agencies via thirdparty gdss may be adversely affected by disruptions in the business relationships between the company and gds operators such disruptions including a failure to agree upon acceptable contract terms when contracts expire or otherwise become subject to renegotiation may cause the carriers’ flight information to be limited or unavailable for display significantly increase fees for both the company and gds users and impair the company’s relationships with its customers and travel agencies the failure of any of the company’s thirdparty service providers to adequately perform their service obligations or other interruptions of services may reduce the company’s revenues and increase its expenses or prevent the company from operating its flights and providing other services to its customers in addition the company’s business and financial performance could be materially harmed if its customers believe that its services are unreliable or unsatisfactory 

ual’s obligations for funding united’s defined benefit pension plans are affected by factors beyond ual’s control 

the company maintains two primary defined benefit pension plans one covering certain pilot employees and another covering certain us nonpilot employees the timing and amount of ual’s funding requirements under these plans depend upon a number of factors including labor negotiations with the applicable employee groups and changes to pension plan benefits as well as factors outside of ual’s control such as the number of applicable retiring employees asset returns interest rates and changes in pension laws changes to these and other factors that can significantly increase ual’s funding requirements such as its liquidity requirements could have a material adverse effect on ual’s financial condition 

union disputes employee strikes or slowdowns and other laborrelated disruptions as well as the integration of united’s workforces in connection with the october 1 2010 merger could adversely affect the company’s operations and could result in increased costs that impair its financial performance 

united is a highly unionized company as of december 31 2013 the company and its subsidiaries had approximately 87000 active employees of whom approximately 80 were represented by various us labor organizations 

the successful integration of united’s workforces in connection with the merger and achievement of the anticipated benefits of the combined company depend in part on integrating employee groups and maintaining productive employee relations in order to fully integrate the premerger represented employee groups the company must negotiate a joint collective bargaining agreement covering each combined group the process for integrating the labor groups is governed by a combination of the rla the mccaskillbond amendment and 

  

where applicable the existing provisions of collective bargaining agreements and union policies a delay in or failure to integrate employee groups presents the potential for increased operating costs and labor disputes that could adversely affect our operations 

the company can provide no assurance that a successful or timely resolution of labor negotiations for all amendable collective bargaining agreements will be achieved there is a risk that unions or individual employees might pursue judicial or arbitral claims arising out of changes implemented as a result of the merger there is also a possibility that employees or unions could engage in job actions such as slowdowns worktorule campaigns sickouts or other actions designed to disrupt the company’s normal operations in an attempt to pressure the company in collective bargaining negotiations although the rla makes such actions unlawful until the parties have been lawfully released to selfhelp and the company can seek injunctive relief against premature selfhelp such actions can cause significant harm even if ultimately enjoined in addition achieving joint collective bargaining agreements with our represented employee groups is likely to increase our labor costs which increase could be material 

see notes 15 and 17 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for more information on labor negotiations and costs 

the airline industry is highly competitive and susceptible to price discounting and changes in capacity which could have a material adverse effect on the company 

the us airline industry is characterized by substantial price competition including from lowcost carriers the significant market presence of lowcost carriers which engage in substantial price discounting has diminished the ability of large network carriers to achieve sustained profitability on domestic and international routes 

airlines also compete for market share by increasing or decreasing their capacity including route systems and the number of markets served several of the company’s domestic and international competitors have increased their international capacity by including service to some destinations that the company currently serves causing overlap in destinations served and therefore increasing competition for those destinations in addition the company and certain of its competitors have implemented significant capacity reductions in recent years in response to high and volatile fuel prices and stagnant global economic growth further certain of the company’s competitors may not reduce capacity or may increase capacity impacting the expected benefit to the company from capacity reductions this increased competition in both domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

the airline industry may undergo further bankruptcy restructuring industry consolidation or the creation or modification of alliances or joint ventures any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company 

the company faces and may continue to face strong competition from other carriers due to bankruptcy restructuring industry consolidation and the creation and modification of alliances and joint ventures a number of carriers have filed for bankruptcy protection in recent years and other domestic and international carriers could restructure in bankruptcy or threaten to do so in the future to reduce their costs carriers operating under bankruptcy protection can operate in a manner that could be adverse to the company and could emerge from bankruptcy as more vigorous competitors 

both the us and international airline industries have experienced consolidation through a number of mergers and acquisitions on december 9 2013 the same date american airlines emerged from bankruptcy protection us airways and american airlines closed their merger transaction and as a result of the merger transaction the company anticipates us airways will exit star alliance on march 30 2014 the company is also facing stronger competition from expanded airline alliances and joint ventures carriers may improve their competitive positions through airline alliances slot swaps andor joint ventures certain airline joint ventures further competition by allowing airlines to coordinate routes pool revenues and costs and enjoy other mutual benefits achieving many of the benefits of consolidation “open skies” agreements including the agreements between the united states and the european union and between the united states and japan may also give rise to additional consolidation or better integration opportunities among international carriers 

  

there is ongoing speculation that further airline consolidations or reorganizations could occur in the future the company routinely engages in analysis and discussions regarding its own strategic position including alliances asset acquisitions and divestitures and may have future discussions with other airlines regarding strategic activities if other airlines participate in such activities those airlines may significantly improve their cost structures or revenue generation capabilities thereby potentially making them stronger competitors of the company and potentially impairing the company’s ability to realize expected benefits from its own strategic relationships 

increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage may materially and adversely impact the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

following the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 the company’s insurance costs increased significantly and the availability of thirdparty war risk terrorism insurance decreased significantly the company has obtained thirdparty war risk terrorism insurance through a special program administered by the faa the faa’s statutory authority to provide war risk insurance to air carriers expires on september 30 2014 an extension of such authority will require legislation by the us congress should the government discontinue this coverage obtaining comparable coverage from commercial underwriters could result in substantially higher premiums and more restrictive terms if the company is unable to obtain adequate thirdparty war risk terrorism insurance its business could be materially and adversely affected 

if any of the company’s aircraft were to be involved in an accident or if the company’s property or operations were to be affected by a significant natural catastrophe or other event the company could be exposed to significant liability or loss if the company is unable to obtain sufficient insurance including aviation hull and liability insurance and property and business interruption coverage to cover such liabilities or losses whether due to insurance market conditions or otherwise its results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

the company could experience adverse publicity harm to its brand reduced travel demand and potential tort liability as a result of an accident catastrophe or incident involving its aircraft the aircraft of its regional carriers or the aircraft of its codeshare partners which may result in a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial position 

an accident catastrophe or incident involving an aircraft that the company operates or an aircraft that is operated by a codeshare partner or one of the company’s regional carriers could have a material adverse effect on the company if such accident catastrophe or incident created a public perception that the company’s operations or the operations of its codeshare partners or regional carriers are not safe or reliable or less safe or reliable than other airlines such public perception could in turn result in adverse publicity for the company cause harm to the company’s brand and reduce travel demand on the company’s flights or the flights of its codeshare partners or regional carriers 

in addition any such accident catastrophe or incident could expose the company to significant tort liability although the company currently maintains liability insurance in amounts and of the type the company believes to be consistent with industry practice to cover damages arising from any such accident or catastrophe and the company’s codeshare partners and regional carriers carry similar insurance and generally indemnify the company for their operations if the company’s liability exceeds the applicable policy limits or the ability of another carrier to indemnify it the company could incur substantial losses from an accident catastrophe or incident which may result in a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial position 

the company’s results of operations fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors associated with the airline industry 

due to greater demand for air travel during the spring and summer months revenues in the airline industry in the second and third quarters of the year are generally stronger than revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year which are periods of lower travel demand the company’s results of operations generally reflect this 

  

seasonality but have also been impacted by numerous other factors that are not necessarily seasonal including among others the imposition of excise and similar taxes extreme or severe weather air traffic control congestion geological events natural disasters changes in the competitive environment due to industry consolidation general economic conditions and other factors as a result the company’s quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year and historical operating results in a quarterly or annual period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 

terrorist attacks or international hostilities or the fear of terrorist attacks or hostilities even if not made directly on the airline industry could negatively affect the company and the airline industry 

the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 involving commercial aircraft severely and adversely impacted the company’s financial condition and results of operations as well as the prospects for the airline industry among the effects experienced from the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks were substantial flight disruption costs caused by the faaimposed temporary grounding of the us airline industry’s fleet significantly increased security costs and associated passenger inconvenience increased insurance costs substantially higher ticket refunds and significantly decreased traffic and passenger revenue 

additional terrorist attacks even if not made directly on the airline industry or the fear of or the precautions taken in anticipation of such attacks including elevated national threat warnings or selective cancellation or redirection of flights could materially and adversely affect the company and the airline industry wars and other international hostilities could also have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition liquidity and results of operations the company’s financial resources may not be sufficient to absorb the adverse effects of any future terrorist attacks or other international hostilities 

an outbreak of a disease or similar public health threat could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business financial position and results of operations 

an outbreak of a disease or similar public health threat that affects travel demand or travel behavior or travel restrictions or reduction in the demand for air travel caused by an outbreak of a disease or similar public health threat in the future could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

the company may never realize the full value of its intangible assets or its longlived assets causing it to record impairments that may negatively affect its financial position and results of operations 

in accordance with applicable accounting standards the company is required to test its indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis on october 1 of each year or more frequently if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred in addition the company is required to test certain of its other assets for impairment if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred 

the company may be required to recognize impairments in the future due to among other factors extreme fuel price volatility tight credit markets a decline in the fair value of certain tangible or intangible assets unfavorable trends in historical or forecasted results of operations and cash flows and an uncertain economic environment as well as other uncertainties the company can provide no assurance that a material impairment charge of tangible or intangible assets will not occur in a future period the value of our aircraft could be impacted in future periods by changes in supply and demand for these aircraft such changes in supply and demand for certain aircraft types could result from grounding of aircraft by the company or other carriers an impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the company’s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for us federal income tax purposes may be significantly limited due to various circumstances including certain possible future transactions involving the sale or issuance of ual common stock or if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels 

as of december 31 2013 ual reported consolidated federal net operating loss “nol” carryforwards of approximately 11 billion 

  

the company’s ability to use its nol carryforwards may be limited if it experiences an “ownership change” as defined in section 382 “section 382” of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended an ownership change generally occurs if certain stockholders increase their aggregate percentage ownership of a corporation’s stock by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest percentage ownership at any time during the testing period which is generally the threeyear period preceding any potential ownership change 

there is no assurance that the company will not experience a future ownership change under section 382 that may significantly limit or possibly eliminate its ability to use its nol carryforwards potential future transactions involving the sale or issuance of ual common stock including the exercise of conversion options under the terms of the company’s convertible debt repurchase of such debt with ual common stock issuance of ual common stock for cash and the acquisition or disposition of such stock by a stockholder owning 5 or more of ual common stock or a combination of such transactions may increase the possibility that the company will experience a future ownership change under section 382 

under section 382 a future ownership change would subject the company to additional annual limitations that apply to the amount of preownership change nols that may be used to offset postownership change taxable income this limitation is generally determined by multiplying the value of a corporation’s stock immediately before the ownership change by the applicable longterm taxexempt rate any unused annual limitation may subject to certain limits be carried over to later years and the limitation may under certain circumstances be increased by builtin gains in the assets held by such corporation at the time of the ownership change this limitation could cause the company’s us federal income taxes to be greater or to be paid earlier than they otherwise would be and could cause all or a portion of the company’s nol carryforwards to expire unused similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes the company’s ability to use its nol carryforwards will also depend on the amount of taxable income it generates in future periods its nol carryforwards may expire before the company can generate sufficient taxable income to use them in full 

ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation limits certain transfers of its stock which could have an effect on the market price of ual common stock 

to reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect on the company’s ability to use its nol carryforwards for federal income tax purposes ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains a 5 ownership limitation this limitation generally remained effective until february 1 2014 or until such later date as may be approved by the board of directors in its sole discretion the limitation prohibits i an acquisition by a single stockholder of shares that results in that stockholder owning 5 or more of ual common stock and ii any acquisition or disposition of common stock by a stockholder that already owns 5 or more of ual common stock unless prior written approval is granted by the board of directors on december 5 2013 the board of directors approved an extension of the 5 ownership limitation through february 1 2017 

any transfer of common stock in violation of these restrictions will be void and will be treated as if such transfer never occurred this provision of ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation may impair or prevent a sale of common stock by a stockholder and adversely affect the price at which a stockholder can sell ual common stock in addition this limitation may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the company creating a perception that a change in control cannot occur or otherwise discouraging takeover attempts that some stockholders may consider beneficial which could also adversely affect the market price of the ual common stock the company cannot predict the effect that this provision in ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation may have on the market price of the ual common stock for additional information regarding the 5 ownership limitation please refer to ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation available on the company’s website 

certain provisions of ual’s governance documents could discourage or delay changes of control or changes to the board of directors 

certain provisions of ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws together the “governance documents” may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the board of directors and may discourage takeover attempts that some of its stockholders may consider beneficial 

  

certain provisions of the governance documents may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if the board of directors determines that such changes in control are not in the best interests of ual and its stockholders these provisions of the governance documents are not intended to prevent a takeover but are intended to protect and maximize the value of ual’s stockholders’ interests while these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of ual to negotiate with the board of directors they could enable the board of directors to prevent a transaction that some or a majority of its stockholders might believe to be in their best interests or they could prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

the issuance of additional shares of ual’s capital stock including the issuance of common stock upon conversion of convertible notes and upon a noteholder’s exercise of its option to require ual to repurchase convertible notes would cause dilution to the interests of its existing stockholders 

ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes up to one billion shares of common stock in certain circumstances ual can issue shares of common stock without stockholder approval in addition the board of directors is authorized to issue up to 250 million shares of preferred stock without par value without any action on the part of ual’s stockholders the board of directors also has the power without stockholder approval to set the terms of any series of shares of preferred stock that may be issued including voting rights conversion rights dividend rights preferences over ual’s common stock with respect to dividends or if ual liquidates dissolves or winds up its business and other terms if ual issues preferred stock in the future that has a preference over its common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon its liquidation dissolution or winding up or if ual issues preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of its common stock the rights of holders of its common stock or the market price of its common stock could be adversely affected 

the company is also authorized to issue without stockholder approval other securities convertible into either preferred stock or in certain circumstances common stock as of december 31 2013 ual had approximately 750 million of convertible debt outstanding holders of these securities may convert them into shares of ual common stock according to their terms in addition certain of ual’s notes include noteholder early redemption options if a noteholder exercises such option ual may elect to pay the repurchase price in cash shares of its common stock or a combination thereof see note 11 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information related to these convertible notes the number of shares issued could be significant and such an issuance could cause significant dilution to the interests of its existing stockholders in addition if ual elects to pay the repurchase price in cash its liquidity could be adversely affected 

in the future ual may decide to raise additional capital through offerings of ual common stock securities convertible into ual common stock or exercise rights to acquire these securities or its common stock the issuance of additional shares of common stock including upon the conversion or repurchase of convertible debt could result in significant dilution of existing stockholders’ equity interests in ual issuances of substantial amounts of its common stock or the perception that such issuances could occur may adversely affect prevailing market prices for ual’s common stock and ual cannot predict the effect this dilution may have on the price of its common stock

 2013 operational highlights 

 

  

  

   

2014 outlook 

set forth below is a discussion of the principal matters that we believe could impact our financial and operating performance and cause our results of operations in future periods to differ materially from our historical operating results andor from our anticipated results of operations described in the forwardlooking statements in this report see item 1a risk factors of this report and the factors described under “forwardlooking information” for further discussion of these and other factors that could affect us 

the company is committed to improving the efficiency and quality of all aspects of its business in 2014 key initiatives for the year include improving customer experience by adding satellitebased wifi on more than 300 additional mainline aircraft introducing a new unitedcom website refurbishing aircraft interiors investing in our airports and taking delivery of more than 50 new highlyefficient and customerpleasing aircraft 

economic conditions the economic outlook for the aviation industry in 2014 is characterized by expected slow or modest us and global economic growth in such conditions we expect a modest increase in the demand for air travel continuing economic uncertainty including uncertainty in the strength of key asian markets such as china and continued political and socioeconomic tensions in regions such as the middle east may result in diminished demand for air travel and may impair our ability to achieve sufficient profitability in 2014 

capacity over the past three years the company leveraged the flexibility of its combined fleet to better match capacity with market demand in 2014 the company expects consolidated asms to grow between 1 and 2 yearoveryear the company announced that it is expanding its worldwide route network in 2014 by launching nonstop service from san francisco to chengdu china the fourthlargest city in china and taipei taiwan and from chicago to edinburgh scotland and new routes from its hubs to international destinations such as houston to munich and washington dulles to madrid should fuel prices increase significantly or should the us or global economic growth outlook decline substantially we would likely adjust our capacity plans to reflect the different operating environment 

in february of 2014 the company announced that it would be reducing its flying from cleveland in stages beginning in april the company will reduce its average daily departures from cleveland by around 60 percent the decision to reduce flying was driven by continued losses in cleveland and the timing of the flight reductions was accelerated by industrywide effects of new federal regulations that impact the company and its regional partner flying these new regulations impact the company and its regional partner flying as they have caused mainline airlines to hire regional pilots while simultaneously significantly reducing the pool of new pilots from which regional carriers themselves can hire although this is an industry issue it directly affects the company and requires it to reduce regional partner flying as several regional partners are beginning to have difficulty flying their schedules due to reduced new pilot availability as a result we will be reducing our average daily departures from cleveland by approximately 60 we expect to be able to keep almost all mainline departures reducing only one of our 26 peak day mainline departures but will need to reduce regional departures from cleveland by over 70 we will make these reductions in roughly onethird increments in each of early april may and june 2014 when the schedule reductions are fully implemented in june we plan to offer 72 peakday flights from cleveland and serve 20 destinations from cleveland on a nonstop basis we currently expect to reduce up to 470 airport operations and catering positions in cleveland those reductions will likely begin in june the company expects to record a special charge in 2014 related to the reduction in force and other contractual commitments at cleveland the company is not currently able to estimate the amount of these charges or the time period in which they will be recorded but such amounts could be significant 

fuel the company’s average aircraft fuel price per gallon including related taxes was 313 in 2013 as compared to 327 in 2012 if fuel prices rise significantly from their current levels we may be unable to raise fares or other fees sufficiently to fully offset our increased costs in addition high fuel prices may impair our ability to achieve profitability based on projected fuel consumption in 2014 a one dollar change in the price of a barrel of crude oil would change the company’s annual fuel expense by approximately 94 million to protect against increases in the prices of aircraft fuel the company routinely hedges a portion of its future fuel requirements 

  

labor as of december 31 2013 united had approximately 80 of employees represented by unions during 2013 the company accepted an integrated seniority list for its pilots from the air line pilots association international the company also announced that the fleet service passenger service and storekeeper work groups at its united cmi and mileageplus subsidiaries ratified new joint labor agreements we are in the process of negotiating amended collective bargaining agreements with our remaining employee groups without joint collective bargaining agreements including our technicians flight attendants and dispatchers the company cannot predict the outcome of negotiations with its unionized employee groups although significant increases in the pay and benefits resulting from new collective bargaining agreements would have a material financial impact on the company 

casm in 2014 the company expects casm excluding fuel thirdparty business expense profit sharing and special charges to increase 1 to 2 yearoveryear 

the company has begun a project to reduce its annual costs by 2 billion and generate an incremental 700 million in additional ancillary revenue by the end of 2017 the savings are comprised of 1 billion in annual fuel savings and 1 billion of nonfuel savings 

results of operations 

in this section we compare results of operations for the year ended december 31 2013 with results of operations for the year ended december 31 2012 and results of operations for the year ended december 31 2012 with results of operations for the year ended december 31 2011 nongaap financial measures are presented because they provide management and investors with the ability to measure and monitor the company’s performance on a consistent basis 

2013 compared to 2012 

operating revenue 

the table below illustrates the yearoveryear percentage change in the company’s operating revenues for the years ended december 31 in millions except percentage changes 

 

   

the table below presents the company’s passenger revenues and operating data based on geographic region regional flights consist primarily of domestic routes 

 

  a see part ii item 6 of this report for the definition of these statistics 

consolidated passenger revenue in 2013 increased 539 million or 17 as compared to 2012 this increase was primarily due to an increase in consolidated yield of 18 and an increase in average fare per passenger of 26 offset in part by a decline in capacity of 14 and a reduction in traffic of 02 as compared to the yearago period consolidated passenger revenue was also impacted by factors including additional competitive capacity in china and the japanese yen weakening against the us dollar resulting in lower pacific yields and a revenue management demand forecast which underestimated the amount of closein booking demand resulting in a lowerthanexpected yield mix 

cargo revenue decreased by 136 million or 134 in 2013 as compared to 2012 due to lower volumes on freight primarily in the domestic and atlantic regions offset slightly by an increase in mail revenue for the period both freight volume and yield continued to decrease in 2013 compared to 2012 due primarily to the continuation of declining demand for shipments of freight 

other operating revenue increased 724 million or 204 in 2013 as compared to 2012 which was primarily due to the sale of aircraft fuel of approximately 400 million to a third party other operating revenue also increased due to additional revenue from nonairline partners under our mileageplus loyalty program passenger ticket change fees and sales of airport lounge access 

  

operating expense 

the table below includes data related to the company’s operating expense for the year ended december 31 in millions except percentage changes

b this figure does not include noncash marktomarket “ncmtm” gains which the company records in nonoperating income expense miscellaneous net ncmtm gains were 45 million and 38 million in 2013 and 2012 respectively 

salaries and related costs increased 680 million or 86 in 2013 as compared to 2012 the increase was due to higher pay rates driven by new collective bargaining agreements profit sharing and other incentive programs as well as increased pension and retirement plan costs for 2014 pensions and other postretirement benefits expense is expected to decrease due to significant plan changes but will be offset by higher wage rates from new collective bargaining agreements 

landing fees and other rent increased 161 million or 83 in 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily due to a transition from paying regional carriers for landing fees to paying airports directly landing fees paid directly to airports are charged to landing fees and other rent while payments to regional carriers are recorded to regional 

  

capacity purchase as a result of this change there has been a significant shift of expense out of regional capacity purchase into landing fees and other rent in 2013 other rent also increased as a result of the increase in rent at newark liberty pursuant to an amendment to united’s terminal c lease signed in early 2013 that extended the term of the terminal c lease with respect to concourses c1 and c2 at newark liberty until 2033 

aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs increased 61 million or 35 in 2013 as compared to 2012 primarily due to increased volume and scope of airframe heavy checks mainly on the boeing 747 and boeing 757 fleet types partially offset by a reduction in engine maintenance volumes driven mainly by the timing of overhauls 

depreciation and amortization increased 167 million or 110 in 2013 as compared to 2012 due to additions in owned property and equipment in the current year specifically related to new aircraft and improvements at airport facilities as well as accelerated depreciation of 89 million on 30 boeing 757200 aircraft in process of being sold to a third party 

other operating expenses increased 514 million or 110 in 2013 as compared to 2012 due to the cost of aircraft fuel sold to a third party and an increase in other personnelrelated expenses

the following table illustrates the yearoveryear dollar and percentage changes in the company’s nonoperating income expense in millions except percentage changes

in 2013 miscellaneous net included a gain of 84 million from fuel hedge derivatives as compared to a gain of 37 million in 2012 

united’s nonoperating expense also included a net gain of 70 million associated with marking to market the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities related to agreements that provide for united’s convertible debt to be settled with ual common stock as compared to a net gain of 42 million in 2012 this net gain and related derivatives are reflected only in the united standalone financial statements as they are eliminated at the consolidated level see note 9 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information

consolidated passenger revenue in 2012 increased approximately 72 million or 02 as compared to 2011 this increase was due to an increase of 12 in both average fare per passenger and yield over the same period as a result of improved pricing primarily from industry capacity discipline offset by a 10 decline in passengers the reduced traffic from both business and leisure passengers in 2012 was offset by higher fares which drove improvements in both average fare per passenger and yield 

cargo revenue decreased by 149 million or 128 in 2012 as compared to 2011 due to excess industry capacity and a weaker demand environment both cargo volume and yield declined in 2012 compared to 2011 freight revenue in 2012 decreased 134 compared to 2011 due to lower volume fuel surcharges and processing fees mail revenue decreased 81 in 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily due to lower volume 

the company recorded a special adjustment in 2011 to decrease frequent flyer deferred revenue and increase revenue by 107 million in connection with a modification to the consolidated amended and restated cobranded card marketing services agreement the “cobrand agreement” with chase bank usa na “chase” see note 17 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information 

other operating revenue was up 226 million or 68 in 2012 as compared to 2011 which was primarily due to a change in the deferral rate related to the sales of credit card miles in conjunction with the modification of the cobrand agreement in accordance with accounting standards update 200913 multipledeliverable revenue arrangements  a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force which was adopted in 2011 other operating revenue also increased due to additional sales of aircraft fuel to a third party

eetcs in august 2013 december 2012 and october 2012 united created separate eetc passthrough trusts each of which issued passthrough certificates the proceeds of the issuance of the passthrough certificates are used to purchase equipment notes issued by united and secured by its aircraft the company records the debt obligation upon issuance of the equipment notes rather than upon the initial issuance of the passthrough certificates the passthrough certificates represent fractional undivided interests in the respective passthrough trusts and are not obligations of united the payment obligations under the equipment notes are those of united proceeds received from the sale of passthrough certificates are initially held by a depositary in escrow for the benefit of the certificate holders until united issues equipment notes to the trust which purchases such notes with a portion of the escrowed funds these escrowed funds are not guaranteed by united and are not reported as debt on our consolidated balance sheet because the proceeds held by the depositary are not united’s assets united has received all of the proceeds from the 2012 eetcs united expects to receive all proceeds from the august 2013 passthrough trusts by the end of 2014 certain details of the passthrough trusts are as follows in millions except interest rate 

 

 the company evaluated whether the passthrough trusts formed are variable interest entities “vies” required to be consolidated by the company under applicable accounting guidance and determined that the passthrough trusts are vies the company determined that it does not have a variable interest in the passthrough trusts the company does not invest in or obtain a financial interest in the passthrough trusts rather united has an obligation to make interest and principal payments on its equipment notes held by the passthrough trusts the company did not intend to have any voting or nonvoting equity interest in the passthrough trusts or to absorb variability from the passthrough trusts based on this analysis the company determined that it is not required to consolidate the passthrough trusts 

increased cost provisions in the company’s financing transactions that include loans the company typically agrees to reimburse lenders for any reduced returns with respect to the loans due to any change in capital requirements and in the case of loans in which the interest rate is based on libor for certain other increased costs that the lenders incur in carrying these loans as a result of any change in law subject in most cases to certain mitigation obligations of the lenders at december 31 2013 the company had 21 billion of floating rate debt and 286 million of fixed rate debt with remaining terms of up to twelve years that are subject to these increased cost provisions in several financing transactions involving loans or leases from nonus entities with 

  

remaining terms of up to twelve years and an aggregate balance of 23 billion we bear the risk of any change in tax laws that would subject loan or lease payments thereunder to nonus entities to withholding taxes subject to customary exclusions 

fuel consortia united participates in numerous fuel consortia with other air carriers at major airports to reduce the costs of fuel distribution and storage interline agreements govern the rights and responsibilities of the consortia members and provide for the allocation of the overall costs to operate the consortia based on usage the consortia and in limited cases the participating carriers have entered into longterm agreements to lease certain airport fuel storage and distribution facilities that are typically financed through taxexempt bonds either special facilities lease revenue bonds or general airport revenue bonds issued by various local municipalities in general each consortium lease agreement requires the consortium to make lease payments in amounts sufficient to pay the maturing principal and interest payments on the bonds as of december 31 2013 approximately 12 billion principal amount of such bonds were secured by significant fuel facility leases in which united participates as to which united and each of the signatory airlines have provided indirect guarantees of the debt as of december 31 2013 the company’s contingent exposure was approximately 250 million principal amount of such bonds based on its recent consortia participation the company’s contingent exposure could increase if the participation of other air carriers decreases the guarantees will expire when the taxexempt bonds are paid in full which range from 2014 to 2041 the company did not record a liability at the time these indirect guarantees were made 

critical accounting policies 

critical accounting policies are defined as those that are affected by significant judgments and uncertainties which potentially could result in materially different accounting under different assumptions and conditions the company has prepared the financial statements in conformity with us gaap which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions the company has identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of the financial statements 

passenger revenue recognition the value of unused passenger tickets is included in current liabilities as advance ticket sales the company records passenger ticket sales and tickets sold by other airlines for use on united as passenger revenue when the transportation is provided or upon estimated breakage tickets sold by other airlines are recorded at the estimated values to be billed to the other airlines differences between amounts billed and the actual amounts may be rejected and rebilled or written off if the amount recorded was different from the original estimate when necessary the company records a reserve against our interline billings and payables if historical experience indicates that these amounts are different nonrefundable tickets generally expire on the date of the intended flight unless the date is extended by notification from the customer on or before the intended flight date 

fees charged in association with changes or extensions to nonrefundable tickets are recorded as other revenue at the time the fee is incurred the fare on the changed ticket including any additional collection is deferred and recognized in accordance with our transportation revenue recognition policy at the time the transportation is provided change fees related to nonrefundable tickets are considered a separate transaction from the air transportation because they represent a charge for the company’s additional service to modify a previous sale therefore the pricing of the change fee and the initial customer order are separately determined and represent distinct earnings processes refundable tickets expire after one year 

the company records an estimate of breakage revenue on the flight date for tickets that will expire unused these estimates are based on the evaluation of actual historical results and forecasted trends 

  

frequent flyer accounting the company has a frequent flyer program that is designed to increase customer loyalty program participants earn mileage credits “miles” by flying on united and certain other participating airlines program participants can also earn miles through purchases from other nonairline partners that participate in the company’s loyalty program we sell miles to these partners which include credit card issuers retail merchants hotels car rental companies and our participating airline partners miles can be redeemed for free other than taxes and government imposed fees discounted or upgraded air travel and nontravel awards the company records its obligation for future award redemptions using a deferred revenue model 

in the case of the sale of air services the company recognizes a portion of the ticket sales as revenue when the air transportation occurs and defers a portion of the ticket sale representing the value of the related miles as a multipledeliverable revenue arrangement the company determines the estimated selling price of the air transportation and miles as if each element is sold on a separate basis the total consideration from each ticket sale is then allocated to each of these elements individually on a pro rata basis the company’s estimated selling price of miles is based on the price we sell miles to star alliance partners in our reciprocal frequent flyer agreements as the best estimate of selling price for these miles 

on december 9 2013 us airways and american airlines closed their merger transaction and as a result of the merger transaction we anticipate us airways will exit star alliance on march 30 2014 effective with the exit date of us airways from star alliance the company will update its estimated selling price for miles to using the equivalent ticket value less fulfillment discount as the estimated selling price for miles the equivalent ticket value used as the basis for the estimated selling price of miles is based on the prior 12 months’ weighted average equivalent ticket value of similar fares as those used to settle award redemptions while taking into consideration such factors as redemption pattern cabin class and geographic region management believes this change is a change in estimate and as such the change will be applied on a prospective basis the estimated impact of this change on consolidated revenue is not expected to be material in 2014 

united also has a significant contract to sell frequent flyer miles to its cobranded credit card partner chase united identified five revenue elements in the cobrand agreement the air transportation element represented by the value of the mile generally resulting from its redemption for future air transportation and whose fair value is described above use of the united brand and access to frequent flyer member lists advertising baggage services and airport lounge usage together excluding “the air transportation element” the “marketingrelated deliverables” 

the fair value of the elements is determined using management’s estimated selling price of each element the objective of using the estimated selling price based methodology is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis accordingly we determine our best estimate of selling price by considering multiple inputs and methods including but not limited to discounted cash flows brand value volume discounts published selling prices number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed the company estimated the selling prices and volumes over the term of the cobrand agreement in order to determine the allocation of proceeds to each of the multiple elements to be delivered the method for determining the selling price of the mile component is changing march 30 2014 as described above we also evaluate volumes on an annual basis which may result in a change in the allocation of estimated selling price on a prospective basis 

the company accounts for miles sold and awarded that will never be redeemed by program members which we refer to as breakage the company reviews its breakage estimates annually based upon the latest available information regarding redemption and expiration patterns the company’s estimate of the expected expiration of miles requires significant management judgment current and future changes to expiration assumptions or to the expiration policy or to program rules and program redemption opportunities may result in material changes to the deferred revenue balance as well as recognized revenues from the programs effective march 30 2014 the company will incorporate a fulfillment discount into its best estimate of selling price which incorporates the expected redemption of miles 

the company records passenger revenue related to the air transportation element when the transportation is delivered the other elements are generally recognized as other operating revenue when earned 

  

the following table summarizes information related to the company’s frequent flyer deferred revenue liability 

 

 longlived assets the net book value of operating property and equipment for the company was 18 billion and 173 billion at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively the assets’ recorded value is impacted by a number of accounting policy elections including the estimation of useful lives and residual values and when necessary the recognition of asset impairment charges 

the company records assets acquired including aircraft at acquisition cost depreciable life is determined through economic analysis such as reviewing existing fleet plans obtaining appraisals and comparing estimated lives to other airlines that operate similar fleets as aircraft technology has improved useful life has increased and the company has generally estimated the lives of those aircraft to be 30 years residual values are estimated based on historical experience with regard to the sale of both aircraft and spare parts and are established in conjunction with the estimated useful lives of the related fleets residual values are based on when the aircraft are acquired and typically reflect asset values that have not reached the end of their physical life both depreciable lives and residual values are revised periodically as facts and circumstances arise to recognize changes in the company’s fleet plan and other relevant information a oneyear increase in the average depreciable life of the company’s flight equipment would reduce annual depreciation expense on flight equipment by approximately 50 million 

the company evaluates the carrying value of longlived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist for purposes of this testing the company has generally identified the aircraft fleet type as the lowest level of identifiable cash flows for purposes of testing aircraft for impairment an impairment charge is recognized when the asset’s carrying value exceeds its net undiscounted future cash flows and its fair market value the amount of the charge is the difference between the asset’s carrying value and fair market value 

defined benefit plan accounting we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees the most critical assumptions impacting our defined benefit pension plan obligations and expenses are the weighted average discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on the plan assets 

united’s pension plans’ underfunded status was 16 billion at december 31 2013 funding requirements for taxqualified defined benefit pension plans are determined by government regulations we estimate that our minimum funding requirements during 2014 are approximately 288 million the fair value of the plans’ assets was 24 billion at december 31 2013 

when calculating pension expense for 2014 the company assumed that its plans’ assets would generate a longterm rate of return of 733 the expected longterm rate of return assumption was developed based on historical experience and input from the trustee managing the plans’ assets the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of assets which is based on a goal of earning the highest rate of return while maintaining risk at acceptable levels our projected longterm rate of return is slightly higher than some market indices due to the active management of our plans’ assets and is supported by the historical returns on our plans’ assets the plans strive to have assets sufficiently diversified so that adverse or unexpected results from one security class will not have an unduly detrimental impact on the entire portfolio plan fiduciaries regularly review actual asset allocation and the pension plans’ investments are periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 

  

the defined benefit pension plans’ assets consist of return generating investments and risk mitigating investments which are held through direct ownership or through interests in common collective trusts return generating investments include primarily equity securities fixedincome securities and alternative investments eg private equity and hedge funds risk mitigating investments include primarily us government and investment grade corporate fixedincome securities the allocation of assets was as follows at december 31 2013 

 

 pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases lowering the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets by 50 basis points from 733 to 683 would increase estimated 2014 pension expense by approximately 12 million 

future pension obligations for united’s plans were discounted using a weighted average rate of 509 at december 31 2013 the company selected the 2013 discount rate for each of its plans by using a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds at december 31 2013 that would provide the necessary cash flows to match the projected benefit payments 

the pension liability and future pension expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points from 509 to 459 would increase the pension liability at december 31 2013 by approximately 411 million and increase the estimated 2014 pension expense by approximately 49 million 

future changes in plan asset returns plan provisions assumed discount rates pension funding law and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future 

actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions under the applicable accounting standards for defined benefit pension plans those gains and losses are not required to be recognized currently as pension benefit expense but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into expense over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees all gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are amortized to expense over the remaining years of service of the covered active employees at december 31 2013 and 2012 the company had unrecognized actuarial losses for pension benefit plans of 162 million and 826 million respectively recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 

other postretirement benefit plan accounting united’s postretirement plan provides certain health care benefits primarily in the us to retirees and eligible dependents as well as certain life insurance benefits to certain retirees reflected as “other benefits” united also has retiree medical programs that permit retirees who meet certain age and service requirements to continue medical coverage between retirement and medicare eligibility eligible employees are required to pay a portion of the costs of their retiree medical benefits which in some cases may be offset by accumulated unused sick time at the time of their retirement plan benefits are subject to copayments deductibles and other limits as described in the plans 

the company accounts for other postretirement benefits by recognizing the difference between plan assets and obligations or the plan’s funded status in its financial statements other postretirement benefit expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees’ approximate service periods and is generally calculated independently of funding decisions or requirements united has not been required to prefund its plan 

  

obligations which has resulted in a significant net obligation as discussed below the company’s benefit obligation was 18 billion and 27 billion for the other postretirement benefit plans at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively 

the calculation of other postretirement benefit expense and obligations requires the use of a number of assumptions including the assumed discount rate for measuring future payment obligations and the health care cost trend rate the company determines the appropriate discount rate for each of the plans based on current rates on high quality corporate bonds that would generate the cash flow necessary to pay plan benefits when due the company’s weighted average discount rate to determine its benefit obligations as of december 31 2013 was 494 as compared to 412 for december 31 2012 the health care cost trend rate assumed for 2013 was 675 declining to 5 in 2020 as compared to assumed trend rate for 2014 of 725 declining to 50 in 2020 a 1 increase in assumed health care trend rates would increase the company’s total service and interest cost for the year ended december 31 2013 by 21 million whereas a 1 decrease in assumed health care trend rates would decrease the company’s total service and interest cost for the year ended december 31 2013 by 17 million a one percentage point decrease in the weighted average discount rate would increase the company’s postretirement benefit liability by approximately 203 million and increase the estimated 2013 benefits expense by approximately 10 million 

actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions and prior service credits result from a retroactive reduction in benefits due under the plans under the applicable accounting standards for postretirement welfare benefit plans actuarial gains and losses and prior service credits are not required to be recognized currently but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into expense over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees or the average life expectancy of inactive participants and will reduce 2013 pension and retiree medical expense at december 31 2013 and 2012 the company had unrecognized actuarial gainslosses for postretirement welfare benefit plans of 555 million and 79 million respectively recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 

during 2013 the company experienced significant changes in its benefit obligations related to its postretirement medical programs the significant changes resulted from the reduction or elimination of benefits for certain work groups including elimination of the postretirement medical benefits for management and administrative employees and international association of machinists employees with less than 20 years of service these changes are reflected in the december 31 2013 obligation in addition certain key actuarial changes resulted in an additional net reduction of the postretirement medical benefit obligations principally market increases in discount rates changes in participation and retirement rates for retiree medical plans driven primarily by the actual experience in pilot retirement rates resulting from a change of the mandatory pilot retirement age to 65 partially offset by an increase in health care trend rates for postretirement medical plans these changes in benefits that either qualified as curtailments which reduced prior actuarial losses or negative plan amendments are further described in note 8 to the financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this report for additional information related to pension and postretirement plans actuarial assumption changes are reflected as a component of the net actuarial gainslosses during 2013 

income taxes 

the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income including the reversals of deferred tax liabilities during the periods in which those deferred tax assets will become deductible the company’s management assesses available positive and negative evidence regarding the realizability of its deferred tax assets and records a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized to form a conclusion management considers positive evidence in the form of reversing temporary differences projections of future taxable income and tax planning strategies and negative evidence such as recent history of losses although the company was not in a threeyear cumulative loss position at the end of 2013 management determined that the loss in 2012 the overall modest level of cumulative pretax income in the three years ended december 31 2013 of 06 of total revenues in that period 

  

and the uncertainty associated with projecting future taxable income supported the conclusion that the valuation allowance was still necessary management will continue to evaluate future financial performance to determine whether such performance is both sustained and significant enough to provide sufficient evidence to support reversal of the valuation allowance 

forwardlooking information 

certain statements throughout part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this report are forwardlooking and thus reflect the company’s current expectations and beliefs with respect to certain current and future events and financial performance such forwardlooking statements are and will be subject to many risks and uncertainties relating to the company’s operations and business environment that may cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied in such forwardlooking statements words such as “expects” “will” “plans” “anticipates” “indicates” “believes” “forecast” “guidance” “outlook” and similar expressions are intended to identify forwardlooking statements 

additionally forwardlooking statements include statements which do not relate solely to historical facts such as statements which identify uncertainties or trends discuss the possible future effects of current known trends or uncertainties or which indicate that the future effects of known trends or uncertainties cannot be predicted guaranteed or assured all forwardlooking statements in this report are based upon information available to the company on the date of this report the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forwardlooking statement whether as a result of new information future events changed circumstances or otherwise except as required by applicable law 

the company’s actual results could differ materially from these forwardlooking statements due to numerous factors including without limitation the following its ability to comply with the terms of its various financing arrangements the costs and availability of financing its ability to maintain adequate liquidity its ability to execute its operational plans including optimizing its revenue its ability to control its costs including realizing benefits from its resource optimization efforts cost reduction initiatives and fleet replacement programs its ability to utilize its net operating losses its ability to attract and retain customers demand for transportation in the markets in which it operates an outbreak of a disease that affects travel demand or travel behavior demand for travel and the impact that global economic conditions have on customer travel patterns excessive taxation and the inability to offset future taxable income general economic conditions including interest rates foreign currency exchange rates investment or credit market conditions crude oil prices costs of aircraft fuel and energy refining capacity in relevant markets its ability to costeffectively hedge against increases in the price of aircraft fuel any potential realized or unrealized gains or losses related to fuel or currency hedging programs the effects of any hostilities act of war or terrorist attack the ability of other air carriers with whom the company has alliances or partnerships to provide the services contemplated by the respective arrangements with such carriers the costs and availability of aviation and other insurance industry consolidation or changes in airline alliances competitive pressures on pricing and demand its capacity decisions and the capacity decisions of its competitors us or foreign governmental legislation regulation and other actions including open skies agreements and environmental regulations labor costs its ability to maintain satisfactory labor relations and the results of the collective bargaining agreement process with its union groups any disruptions to operations due to any potential actions by its labor groups weather conditions and other risks and uncertainties set forth under part i item 1a risk factors of this report as well as other risks and uncertainties set forth from time to time in the reports the company files with the sec

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend interest rates our net income loss is affected by fluctuations in interest rates eg interest expense on variable rate debt and interest income earned on shortterm investments the company’s policy is to manage interest rate risk through a combination of fixed and variable rate debt the following table summarizes information related to the company’s interest rate market risk at december 31 in millions 

 

 a change in market interest rates would also impact interest income earned on our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments assuming our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments remain at their average 2013 levels a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a corresponding increase in the company’s interest income of approximately 57 million during 2014 

commodity price risk aircraft fuel the availability and price of aircraft fuel significantly affects the company’s operations results of operations financial position and liquidity 

to protect against increases in the prices of aircraft fuel the company routinely hedges a portion of its future fuel requirements the company generally uses financial hedge instruments including fixed price swaps purchased call options and commonly used combinations using put and call options including collars a sold put option combined with a purchased call option threeways a collar with a higher strike sold call option and fourway collars a collar with a higher strike sold call option and a lower strike purchased put option these hedge instruments are generally based on aircraft fuel or closely related commodities including diesel fuel and crude oil 

some financial hedge contracts may result in losses if the underlying commodity prices drop below specified floor prices however the negative impact of these losses may be outweighed by the benefit of lower aircraft fuel cost since the company typically hedges only a portion of its future fuel requirements the company does not enter into derivative instruments for nonrisk management purposes 

if fuel prices decline significantly from the levels existing at the time we enter into a hedge contract we may be required to post collateral margin with our hedge counterparties the company frequently monitors this margin risk and assesses the potential of posting collateral with each of its counterparties at times when the fair market value of the company’s hedge contracts is net positive to the company it is exposed to the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to the hedge contract the company periodically monitors the credit worthiness of its counterparties and limits its exposure to any single counterparty 

  

the company may adjust its hedging program based on changes in market conditions the following table summarizes information related to the company’s cost of fuel and hedging in millions except percentages 

 

  

a includes related taxes and excludes hedging impacts and special charges in 2012 the company’s fuel cost was 36 of total operating expenses 

b based on 2014 projected fuel consumption does not include the impact of fuel hedges 

c as of december 31 2012 the net fair value of the company’s fuel hedges was 46 million 

d based on fuel hedge positions at december 31 2013 

e assumes instantaneous change in prices and includes margin related to some hedge positions beyond december 31 2014 approximately 8 for 2015 

as of december 31 2013 the company had hedged approximately 24 and 8 of its projected fuel requirements 951 million and 309 million gallons respectively for 2014 and 2015 respectively the company does not enter into derivative instruments for nonrisk management purposes 

the fuel hedge portfolio is comprised of many individual hedge contracts primarily option contracts on multiple underlying commodities and entered into at various points in time resulting in a wide range of strike prices with several hedge counterparties the table below provides a view of the economic impact of the hedge portfolio on the company’s 2014 fuel costs given significant moves up to 20 in market fuel prices from december 31 2013 in millions 

 

    

foreign currency the company generates revenues and incurs expenses in numerous foreign currencies changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the company’s results of operations through changes in the dollar value of foreign currencydenominated operating revenues and expenses some of the company’s more significant foreign currency exposures include the canadian dollar chinese renminbi european euro and japanese yen at times the company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency the company does not enter into derivative instruments for nonrisk management purposes at december 31 2013 the company had forward contracts and collars outstanding to hedge 29 of its projected japanese yendenominated cash inflows primarily from passenger ticket sales through 2014 

the result of a uniform 10 percent strengthening in the value of the us dollar from december 31 2013 levels relative to each of the currencies in which the company has foreign currency exposure would result in a decrease in pretax income of approximately 269 million for the year ending december 31 2014 this sensitivity analysis was prepared based upon projected 2014 foreign currencydenominated revenues and expenses as of december 31 2013 and reflects the potential benefit of the japanese yen hedges mentioned above

see notes 1 and 21 to the financial statements included in item 8 of this report and item 1a risk factors for additional information on the merger 

operations 

network the company transports people and cargo through its mainline operations which use jet aircraft with at least 110 seats and its regional operations see item 2 properties for a description of the company’s mainline and regional aircraft 

with key global air rights in the us asiapacific europe middle east africa and latin america ual has the world’s most comprehensive global route network ual through united and continental and their regional carriers operates more than 5500 daily flights to more than 375 us and international destinations from the company’s hubs at newark liberty international airport “newark liberty” chicago o’hare international airport “chicago o’hare” denver international airport “denver” george bush intercontinental airport “houston bush” hopkins international airport “cleveland hopkins” los angeles international airport “lax” ab won pat international airport “guam” san francisco international airport “sfo” and washington dulles international airport “washington dulles” 

all of the company’s domestic hubs are located in large business and population centers contributing to a large amount of “origin and destination” traffic our hub and spoke system allows us to transport passengers between a large number of destinations with substantially more frequent service than if each route were served directly our hub system also allows us to add service to a new destination from a large number of cities using only one or a limited number of aircraft as discussed under alliances below united is a member of star alliance the world’s largest airline network 

regional the company has contractual relationships with various regional carriers to provide regional jet and turboprop service branded as united express these regional operations are an extension of the company’s mainline network this regional service complements our operations by carrying traffic that connects to our mainline service and allows flights to smaller cities that cannot be provided economically with mainline aircraft chautauqua airlines republic airlines “republic” commutair airlines expressjet airlines gojet airlines mesa airlines shuttle america skywest airlines “skywest” and trans states airlines “trans states” are all regional carriers which operate most of their capacity under capacity purchase agreements with united andor 

  

continental under these capacity purchase agreements the company pays the regional carriers contractuallyagreed fees carriercontrolled costs for operating these flights plus a variable reimbursement incentive payment for superior operational performance based on agreed performance metrics the fees for carriercontrolled costs are based on specific rates for various operating expenses of the regional carriers such as crew expenses maintenance and aircraft ownership some of which are multiplied by specific operating statistics eg block hours departures while others are fixed monthly amounts under these capacity purchase agreements the company is responsible for all fuel costs incurred as well as landing fees facilities rent and other costs which are passed through by the regional carrier to the company without any markup in return the regional carriers operate this capacity exclusively for united andor continental on schedules determined by the company the company also determines pricing and revenue management assumes the inventory and distribution risk for the available seats and permits mileage accrual and redemption for regional flights through its mileageplus program 

while the regional carriers operating under capacity purchase agreements comprise more than 95 of all regional flights the company also has prorate agreements with hyannis air service inc “cape air” silver airways “silver” skywest and trans states under these commercial flying agreements the company and its regional carriers agree to divide revenue collected from each passenger according to a formula while both the company and its regional carriers are individually responsible for their own costs of operations unlike capacity purchase agreements under a prorate agreement the regional carrier retains the control and risk of scheduling and in most cases market selection local seat pricing and inventory for its flights although the company and its regional carriers may coordinate schedules to maximize connections 

financial information on the company’s operating revenues by geographic regions as reported to the us department of transportation the “dot” can be found in note 10 to the financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

alliances united and continental have a number of bilateral and multilateral alliances with other airlines which enhance travel options for customers by providing greater time of day coverage to common destinations additional mileage accrual and redemption opportunities and access to markets that united and continental do not serve directly these marketing alliances typically include one or more of the following features loyalty program reciprocity codesharing of flight operations whereby seats on one carrier’s selected flights can be marketed under the brand name of another carrier coordination of reservations ticketing passenger checkin baggage handling and flight schedules and other resourcesharing activities 

united is a member of star alliance a global integrated airline network cofounded by united in 1997 and the largest and most comprehensive airline alliance in the world as of january 1 2013 star alliance carriers served 1329 airports in 194 countries with over 21900 daily flights current star alliance members in addition to united are adria airways aegean airlines air canada air china air new zealand all nippon airways asiana airlines austrian airlines aviancataca airlines brussels airlines copa airlines croatia airlines egyptair ethiopian airlines lot polish airlines lufthansa sas scandinavian airlines shenzhen airlines singapore airlines south african airways swiss tam airlines tap portugal thai airways international turkish airlines and us airways star alliance has announced that eva air will be a future star alliance member on february 14 2013 us airways announced an agreement to merge with amr corporation and its intent to exit star alliance as a result of such merger 

united continental air canada and the lufthansa group which includes lufthansa and its affiliates austrian airlines brussels airlines and swiss participate in a joint venture agreement covering transatlantic routes the joint venture which enables the carriers to integrate the services they operate between the united states and europe and to capture revenue synergies delivers highly competitive flight schedules fares and services the joint venture has a revenuesharing structure that will result in payments among participants based on a formula that compares current period unit revenue performance on transatlantic routes to a historic period or “baseline” which is reset annually the payments are calculated on a quarterly basis and are subject to a cap see industry regulation below the european commission which has been conducting a standard review of the competitive effects of the joint venture has not yet completed its review 

  

united continental and all nippon airways participate in a joint venture agreement covering certain transpacific routes between the united states and japan and other destinations in asia the joint venture which enables the carriers to integrate the services they operate between the united states and asia and to capture revenue synergies delivers highly competitive flight schedules fares and services the joint venture has a revenuesharing structure that results in payments among participants based on a formula that compares current period unit revenue performance on certain transpacific routes to a historic period or “baseline” the payments will be calculated on a quarterly basis and are subject to an annual cap 

in 2010 united continental and air canada entered into a memorandum of understanding to establish a revenue sharing transborder joint venture the parties subsequently drafted a joint venture agreement based on the transatlantic joint venture agreement among united continental air canada and the lufthansa group on october 24 2012 united continental and air canada reached a consent agreement with the canadian competition bureau settling litigation related to the proposed joint venture which will allow its implementation and full coordination among the parties with certain exceptions on a limited number of nonstop routes united continental and air canada already have us antitrust immunity a definitive joint venture agreement has not yet been finalized 

united and continental currently maintain independent marketing agreements with other air carriers including aeromar aer lingus cape air eva air great lakes airlines silver hawaiian airlines island air and jet airways in addition united offers a traintoplane alliance with amtrak from newark liberty to select regional destinations 

loyalty program united’s mileageplus program builds customer loyalty by offering awards and services to program participants members in this program earn mileage credit for flights on united continental united express airlines in star alliance and certain other airlines that participate in the program members can also earn miles by purchasing the goods and services of our network of nonairline partners such as credit card issuers retail merchants hotels and car rental companies members can redeem mileage credits for free discounted or upgraded travel and nontravel awards 

under the company’s consolidated amended and restated cobranded card marketing services agreement dated june 9 2011 the “cobrand agreement” with chase bank usa na “chase” loyalty program members accrue frequent flyer miles for making purchases using cobranded credit cards issued by chase the cobrand agreement provides for joint marketing of the company’s credit card program and provides chase with other benefits such as permission to market to the company’s customer database 

in 2012 47 million mileageplus travel awards were used on united and continental these awards represented 74 and 68 of united’s and continental’s total revenue passenger miles in 2012 respectively 

total miles redeemed for travel on united and continental in 2012 including classofservice upgrades represented 83 of the total miles redeemed in addition excluding miles redeemed for travel on united and continental mileageplus members redeemed miles for approximately 16 million awards in 2012 as compared to 18 million in 2011 these nonunited and noncontinental travel awards include united club memberships car and hotel awards merchandise and travel on another air carrier the decrease in the number of nonunited and noncontinental travel awards redeemed in 2012 compared to 2011 was due to a decrease in hotel car and united club redemptions 

fuel aircraft fuel has been the company’s single largest and most volatile operating expense for the last several years the table below summarizes ual’s aircraft fuel consumption and expense during the last three years 

 

  

  

  

 the availability and price of aircraft fuel significantly affect the company’s operations results of operations financial position and liquidity to provide adequate supplies of fuel the company routinely enters into shortterm and longterm purchase contracts and has some ability to store fuel close to its major hub locations to protect against increases in the prices of aircraft fuel the company routinely hedges a portion of its future fuel requirements the company generally uses commonly used financial hedge instruments based on aircraft fuel or closely related commodities including heating oil diesel fuel and crude oil 

thirdparty business united has thirdparty business revenue that includes fuel sales catering ground handling maintenance services and frequent flyer award nonair redemptions and thirdparty business revenue is recorded in other revenue the company has a contract to sell aircraft fuel to a third party which is earningsneutral but results in revenue and expense specifically cost of sale which is unrelated to the operation of the airline united also incurs thirdparty business expenses such as maintenance ground handling and catering services for third parties fuel sales and nonair mileage redemptions and those thirdparty business expenses are recorded in other operating expenses 

distribution channels the majority of the company’s airline seat inventory continues to be distributed through the traditional channels of travel agencies and global distribution systems “gds” the growing use of the company’s direct sales website unitedcom the company’s mobile applications and alternative distribution systems provides the company with an opportunity to decommoditize its services better control its content make more targeted offerings better retain its customers enhance its brand and lower its ticket distribution costs to encourage customer use of lowercost channels and capitalize on these costsaving opportunities the company will continue to expand the capabilities of its website and mobile applications and explore alternative distribution channels 

industry conditions 

domestic competition the domestic airline industry is highly competitive and dynamic currently any us carrier deemed fit by the dot is free to operate scheduled passenger service between any two points within the united states the company’s competitors consist primarily of other airlines and to a lesser extent other forms of transportation competition can be direct in the form of another carrier flying the exact nonstop route or indirect where a carrier serves the same two cities nonstop from an alternative airport in that city or via an itinerary requiring a connection at another airport 

air carriers’ cost structures are not uniform and there are numerous factors influencing cost structure carriers with lower costs may deliver lower fares to passengers which could have a potential negative impact on the company’s revenues in addition future airline mergers acquisitions or reorganizations pursuant to chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code may enable airlines to improve their revenue and cost performance relative to peers and thus enhance their competitive position within the industry 

decisions on domestic pricing are based on intense competitive pressure exerted on the company by other us airlines in order to remain competitive and maintain passenger traffic levels we often find it necessary to match competitors’ discounted fares since we compete in a dynamic marketplace attempts to generate additional revenue through increased fares oftentimes fail 

international competition internationally the company competes not only with us airlines but also with foreign carriers international competition has increased and may increase in the future as a result of airline mergers and acquisitions joint ventures alliances restructurings liberalization of aviation bilateral agreements and new or increased service by competitors competition on international routes is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation the company’s ability to compete successfully with nonus carriers on international routes depends in part on its ability to generate traffic to and from the entire united states via its integrated domestic route network and its ability to overcome business and operational challenges across its network 

  

worldwide foreign carriers currently are prohibited by us law from carrying local passengers between two points in the united states and the company experiences comparable restrictions in foreign countries in addition in the absence of open skies and fifth freedom rights us carriers are constrained from carrying passengers to points beyond designated international gateway cities due to limitations in air service agreements and restrictions imposed unilaterally by foreign governments to compensate partially for these structural limitations us and foreign carriers have entered into alliances joint ventures and marketing arrangements that enable these carriers to exchange traffic between each other’s flights and route networks see alliances above for further information 

seasonality the air travel business is subject to seasonal fluctuations historically demand for air travel is higher in the second and third quarters driving higher revenues than in the first and fourth quarters which are periods of lower travel demand 

industry regulation 

domestic regulation 

general all carriers engaged in air transportation in the united states are subject to regulation by the dot absent an exemption no air carrier may provide air transportation of passengers or property without first being issued a dot certificate of public convenience and necessity the dot also grants international route authority approves international codeshare arrangements and regulates methods of competition the dot regulates consumer protection and maintains jurisdiction over advertising denied boarding compensation tarmac delays and baggage liability and may add additional expensive regulatory burdens in the future 

airlines are also regulated by the federal aviation administration the “faa” an agency within the dot primarily in the areas of flight safety air carrier operations and aircraft maintenance and airworthiness the faa issues air carrier operating certificates and aircraft airworthiness certificates prescribes maintenance procedures oversees airport operations and regulates pilot and other employee training from time to time the faa issues directives that require air carriers to inspect or modify aircraft and other equipment potentially causing the company to incur substantial unplanned expenses the airline industry is also subject to numerous other federal laws and regulations the us department of homeland security “dhs” has jurisdiction over virtually every aspect of civil aviation security see legislation  below the antitrust division of the us department of justice “doj” has jurisdiction over certain airline competition matters the us postal service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail labor relations in the airline industry are generally governed by the railway labor act “rla” a federal statute the company is also subject to investigation inquiries by the dot faa doj and other us and international regulatory bodies 

airport access access to landing and takeoff rights or “slots” at several major us airports and many foreign airports served by the company are or recently have been subject to government regulation federally mandated domestic slot restrictions currently apply at reagan national airport in washington dc “washington reagan” john f kennedy international airport “jfk” laguardia airport “laguardia” and newark liberty in addition to address concerns about airport congestion the faa has designated certain airports including newark liberty jfk and laguardia as “high density traffic airports” and has imposed operating restrictions at these three airports which may include capacity reductions additional restrictions on airline routes and takeoff and landing slots may be proposed in the future that could affect the company’s rights of ownership and transfer 

legislation the airline industry is subject to legislative activity that may have an impact on operations and costs in addition to significant federal state and local taxes and fees that the company is currently subject to proposed taxes and fees are currently pending that may increase the company’s operating costs if imposed on the company congress may pass legislation that could increase labor and operating costs recently congress has enacted two laws the airline safety and federal aviation extension act of 2010 and the faa modernization and reform act of 2012 which have increased regulation and are likely to cause increased costs in the areas of 

  

airline safety pilot training and consumer protection climate change legislation is also likely to be a significant area of legislative and regulatory focus and could adversely impact the company’s costs see environmental regulation  below 

in december 2009 the dot issued the first of several rules intended to enhance airline passenger protections the 2009 rule included regulations mandating that major air carriers including united and continental adopt detailed contingency plans and implement procedures applicable to tarmac delays exceeding three hours for domestic flights and four hours for international flights subject to exceptions for safety and security in april 2011 the dot issued a second set of consumer protection regulations this second initiative imposed regulations requiring carriers to charge the same baggage fee throughout a passenger’s entire itinerary even if on multiple carriers and expanded the scope of the tarmac delay rule to cover foreign carriers operating to and from the united states although the dot delayed the enforcement date for its new baggage fee regulations until july 2012 it is now in force and could expose united to dot enforcement action and civil penalties 

in december 2011 the faa issued a final rule amending the existing flight duty and rest regulations applicable to us air carriers operating under part 121 of the federal aviation regulations the provisions under the 2011 final rule are likely to negatively impact the company’s operations and increase the company’s costs by mandating extensive changes to the way we schedule crews and deploy aircraft moreover in december 2012 the faa issued a draft policy statement proposing to cede authority over some areas of cabin crewmember workplace safety and health condition oversight to the occupational safety and health administration if this change in policy is finalized it would expose the company to increased regulatory requirements in the aircraft cabin with the potential for increased costs and adverse operational impacts 

finally aviation security continues to be the subject of frequent legislative and regulatory action requiring changes to the company’s security processes frequently increasing the cost of its security procedures and adversely affecting its operations 

international regulation 

general international air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation in connection with the company’s international services the company is regulated by both the us government and the governments of the foreign countries the company serves in addition the availability of international routes to us carriers is regulated by aviation agreements between the us and foreign governments and in some cases fares and schedules require the approval of the dot andor the relevant foreign governments 

legislation foreign countries are increasingly enacting passenger protection laws rules and regulations that meet or exceed us requirements in cases where this activity exceeds us requirements additional burden and liability may be placed on the company the european union “eu” now requires compensation to passengers for canceled and delayed flights in addition to denied boarding compensation similar foreign regulations require passenger compensation and subject the company to enforcement penalties in addition to changes in operating procedures 

airport access historically access to foreign markets has been tightly controlled through bilateral agreements between the us and each foreign country involved these agreements regulate the markets served the number of carriers allowed to serve each market and the frequency of carriers’ flights since the early 1990s the us has pursued a policy of “open skies” meaning all usflag carriers have access to the destination under which the us government has negotiated a number of bilateral agreements allowing unrestricted access between us and foreign markets currently there are more than 100 open skies agreements in effect however many of the airports that the company serves in europe asia and latin america maintain slot controls a large number of these are restrictive due to congestion at these airports london heathrow international airport frankfurt rheinmain airport shanghai pudong international airport beijing capital international airport sao paulo guarhulos international airport tokyo narita international airport and haneda international airport are among the most restrictive foreign airports due to capacity limitations as an example under the 2010 united statesjapan open skies agreement only four slot pairs are available in haneda to us air carriers at this time none of which is held by the company 

  

the company’s ability to serve some foreign markets and expand into certain others is limited by the absence of aviation agreements between the us government and the relevant foreign governments shifts in us or foreign government aviation policies may lead to the alteration or termination of air service agreements depending on the nature of any such change the value of the company’s international route authorities and slot rights may be materially enhanced or diminished 

environmental regulation 

general the airline industry is subject to increasingly stringent federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations concerning emissions to the air discharges to surface and subsurface waters safe drinking water aircraft noise and the management of hazardous substances oils and waste materials areas of either proposed regulations or implementation of new regulations include regulations surrounding the emission of greenhouse gases discussed further below state of california regulations regarding air emissions from ground support equipment and a federal rulemaking seeking to regulate airport fuel hydrant systems under the underground storage tank regulations 

climate change there are certain laws and regulations relating to climate change that apply to the company including the eu emissions trading scheme “eu ets” which is subject to international dispute environmental taxes for certain international flights including the united kingdom’s air passenger duty and germany’s departure ticket tax limited greenhouse gas reporting requirements and the state of california’s cap and trade regulations which impacts united’s san francisco maintenance center in addition there are landbased planning laws that could apply to airport expansion projects requiring a review of greenhouse gas emissions and could affect airlines in certain circumstances 

in 2009 the eu issued a directive to member states to include aviation in its greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme the application of the eu ets to aviation including the requirement for foreign airlines to surrender carbon allowances for emissions occurring outside of the eu airspace has been the subject of significant international dispute among countries with more than forty noneu countries having gone on record opposing the scheme 

on november 12 2012 the eu announced a oneyear stay of the requirements for international flights to the eu which the eu attributed to recent progress by the international civil aviation organization “icao” towards a global regulatory program to regulate aviation greenhouse gas emissions on november 27 2012 the president of the united states signed the european union emissions trading scheme prohibition act of 2011 which encourages the dot to seek an international solution through the icao and if necessary prohibit us airlines from participation in the eu ets and take other actions to hold the airlines harmless from the scheme 

the future of the eu ets legislation as applied to international flights into europe is uncertain but the company will continue to monitor developments the precise cost to the company should the scheme apply to international flights in the future is difficult to calculate due to a number of variables including the company’s future carbon emissions with respect to flights to and from the eu the price of carbon credits and whether the dot will take action to prohibit us airlines from participation in the scheme and hold us airlines harmless from such scheme 

the eu ets stay has increased international attention in its focus on the icao process with the intent to reach an international agreement that would apply to international aviation and prohibit the application of regional schemes without an international agreement there could be other regulatory actions taken in the future by the us government state governments within the us or foreign governments to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry which could result in multiple schemes applying to the same emissions the precise nature of any such requirements and their applicability to the company are difficult to predict but the financial impact to the company and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant including the potential for increased fuel costs carbon taxes or fees or a requirement to purchase carbon credits 

  

the company is taking various actions to reduce its carbon emissions through fleet renewal aircraft retrofits and actions that are establishing the foundation for the commercialization of aviation biofuels 

other environmental matters some us and foreign airports have established airport restrictions to limit noise including restrictions on aircraft types to be used and limits on the number and scheduling of hourly or daily operations in some instances these restrictions have caused curtailments in services or increased operating costs and could limit our ability to expand our operations at the affected airports 

the airline industry is also subject to other environmental laws and regulations that require the company to remediate soil or groundwater to meet certain objectives and which may require significant expenditures under the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as “superfund” and similar environmental cleanup laws generators of waste materials and owners or operators of facilities can be subject to liability for investigation and remediation costs at locations that have been identified as requiring response actions the company also conducts voluntary environmental assessment and remediation actions environmental cleanup obligations can arise from among other circumstances the operation of aircraft fueling facilities and primarily involve airport sites future costs associated with these activities are currently not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

employees 

as of december 31 2012 ual including its subsidiaries had approximately 88000 employees as of december 31 2012 united had approximately 47000 employees and continental had approximately 41000 employees approximately 80 of the combined company’s employees were represented by various us labor organizations as of december 31 2012 

collective bargaining agreements between the company and its represented employee groups are negotiated under the rla which governs labor relations in the air transportation industry such agreements typically do not contain an expiration date and instead specify an amendable date upon which the contract is considered “open for amendment” the process for integrating the represented employee groups of united and continental is governed by a combination of the rla the mccaskillbond amendment and where applicable the existing provisions of united’s and continental’s collective bargaining agreements and union policies under the rla the national mediation board “nmb” has exclusive authority to resolve union representation disputes arising out of airline mergers under the mccaskillbond amendment “fair and equitable” integration of seniority lists is required including arbitration where the interested parties cannot reach a consensual agreement consistent with the process set forth in the alleghenymohawk labor protective provisions or internal union merger policies if applicable pending operational integration the company will apply the terms of the existing collective bargaining agreements unless other terms have been negotiated 

during 2012 various labor agreements were reached between union representatives and the company on december 15 2012 the pilots for both united and continental ratified a joint collective bargaining agreement with the company in february 2013 the company reached tentative agreements on new joint collective bargaining agreements with the international association of machinists “iam” for the fleet service passenger service and storekeeper workgroups at the united continental continental micronesia and mileage plus subsidiaries the tentative agreements with the iam cover more than 28000 employees and are subject to ratification by the iam members we are also currently in the process of negotiating joint collective bargaining agreements with all of our other major represented groups several other collective bargaining agreements were reached with unions at each of our subsidiaries during 2012 including with the united flight attendants in february 2012 the continental micronesia aircraft technicians in may 2012 the continental pilot ground instructors in june 2012 and the continental micronesia flight attendants in august 2012 

  

the following table reflects the company’s represented employee groups number of employees per represented group union representation for each of united’s and continental’s employee groups where applicable amendable date for each employee group’s collective bargaining agreement and whether the group is engaged in negotiations for a joint collective bargaining agreement 

 

   

the company cannot predict the outcome of negotiations with its unionized employee groups although significant increases in the pay and benefits resulting from new collective bargaining agreements would have an adverse financial impact on the company

 item 1a risk factors tableend the following risk factors should be read carefully when evaluating the company’s business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this report and other statements the company or its representatives make from time to time any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect the company’s business operating results financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this report 

the merger may present certain material risks to the company’s business and operations 

the merger described in item 1 business may present certain risks to the company’s business and operations including among other things risks that 

 

  

  

  

  

 accordingly there can be no assurance that the merger will result in the realization of the full benefits of synergies innovation and operational efficiencies that we currently expect that these benefits will be achieved within the anticipated timeframe or that we will be able to fully and accurately measure any such synergies 

continued periods of historically high fuel prices or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a material adverse impact on the company’s operating results financial position and liquidity 

aircraft fuel has been the company’s single largest and most volatile operating expense for the last several years the availability and price of aircraft fuel significantly affect the company’s operations results of operations financial position and liquidity while the company has been able to obtain adequate supplies of fuel under various supply contracts and also stores fuel close to major hub locations to ensure supply continuity in the short term the company cannot predict the continued future availability or price of aircraft fuel 

continued volatility in fuel prices may negatively impact the company’s liquidity in the future aircraft fuel prices can fluctuate based on a multitude of factors including market expectations of supply and demand balance inventory levels geopolitical events economic growth expectations fiscalmonetary policies and financial investment flows the company may not be able to increase its fares or other fees if fuel prices rise in the future and any such fare or fee increases may not be sustainable in the highly competitive airline industry in addition any increases in fares or other fees may not sufficiently offset the full impact of such rises in fuel prices and may also reduce the general demand for air travel 

to protect against increases in the prices of aircraft fuel the company routinely hedges a portion of its future fuel requirements however the company’s hedging program may not be successful in controlling fuel costs and price protection provided may be limited due to market conditions and other factors to the extent that the company uses hedge contracts that have the potential to create an obligation to pay upon settlement if prices decline significantly including swaps or sold put options as 

  

part of a collar such hedge contracts may limit the company’s ability to benefit from lower fuel costs in the future if fuel prices decline significantly from the levels existing at the time we enter into a hedge contract we may be required to post collateral margin with our hedge counterparties beyond certain thresholds also lower fuel prices may result in increased industry capacity and lower fares in general there can be no assurance that the company’s hedging arrangements will provide any particular level of protection against rises in fuel prices or that its counterparties will be able to perform under the company’s hedging arrangements additionally deterioration in the company’s financial condition could negatively affect its ability to enter into new hedge contracts in the future and may potentially require the company to post increased amounts of collateral under its fuel hedging agreements 

in addition the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of 2010 the “doddfrank act” and regulations promulgated by the commodity futures trading commission “cftc” introduce new requirements for centralized clearing for overthecounter derivatives this may include the company’s fuel hedge contracts the ual board of directors has approved the company’s election of the cftc’s enduser exception which permits the company as a nonfinancial end user of derivatives to hedge commercial risk and be exempt from the cftc mandatory clearing requirements however depending on the final regulations adopted by the cftc and other regulators several of the company’s hedge counterparties may be subject to requirements which may raise their costs those increased costs may in turn be passed to the company resulting in increased transaction costs to execute hedge contracts and lower credit thresholds to post collateral margin 

see note 13 to the financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information on the company’s hedging programs 

economic and industry conditions constantly change and unfavorable global economic conditions may have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations 

the company’s business and results of operations are significantly impacted by general economic and industry conditions the airline industry is highly cyclical and the level of demand for air travel is correlated to the strength of the us and global economies robust demand for our air transportation services depends largely on favorable economic conditions including the strength of the domestic and foreign economies low unemployment levels strong consumer confidence levels and the availability of consumer and business credit 

air transportation is often a discretionary purchase that leisure travelers may limit or eliminate during difficult economic times in addition during periods of unfavorable economic conditions business travelers usually reduce the volume of their travel either due to costsaving initiatives or as a result of decreased business activity requiring travel during such periods the company’s business and results of operations may be adversely affected due to significant declines in industry passenger demand particularly with respect to the company’s business and premium cabin travelers and a reduction in fare levels 

stagnant or worsening global economic conditions either in the united states or in other geographic regions and any future volatility in us and global financial and credit markets may have a material adverse effect on the company’s revenues results of operations and liquidity if such economic conditions were to disrupt capital markets in the future the company may be unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all to refinance certain maturing debt and to satisfy future capital commitments 

the company is subject to economic and political instability and other risks of doing business globally 

the company is a global business with operations outside of the united states from which it derives approximately 40 of its operating revenues as measured and reported to the dot the company’s operations in asia europe latin america africa and the middle east are a vital part of its worldwide airline network volatile economic political and market conditions in these international regions may have a negative impact on the company’s operating results and its ability to achieve its business objectives in addition significant or volatile changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies and the imposition of exchange controls or other currency restrictions may have a material adverse impact upon the company’s liquidity revenues costs and operating results 

  

the company may not be able to maintain adequate liquidity 

the company has a significant amount of financial leverage from fixed obligations including aircraft lease and debt financings leases of airport property and other facilities and other material cash obligations in addition the company has substantial noncancelable commitments for capital expenditures including the acquisition of new aircraft and related spare engines 

although the company’s cash flows from operations and its available capital including the proceeds from financing transactions have been sufficient to meet these obligations and commitments to date the company’s future liquidity could be negatively impacted by the risk factors discussed in this item 1a including but not limited to substantial volatility in the price of fuel adverse economic conditions disruptions in the global capital markets and catastrophic external events 

if the company’s liquidity is constrained due to the various risk factors noted in this item 1a or otherwise the company’s failure to comply with certain financial covenants under its financing and credit card processing agreements timely pay its debts or comply with other material provisions of its contractual obligations could result in a variety of adverse consequences including the acceleration of the company’s indebtedness increase of required reserves under credit card processing agreements the withholding of credit card sale proceeds by its credit card service providers and the exercise of other remedies by its creditors and equipment lessors that could result in a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations furthermore constrained liquidity may limit the company’s ability to withstand competitive pressures and limit its flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions including increased competition and demand for new services placing the company at a disadvantage when compared to its competitors that have less debt and making the company more vulnerable than its competitors who have less debt to a downturn in the business industry or the economy in general 

the company’s substantial level of indebtedness and noninvestment grade credit rating as well as market conditions and the availability of assets as collateral for loans or other indebtedness may make it difficult for the company to raise additional capital to meet its liquidity needs on acceptable terms or at all 

see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further information regarding the company’s liquidity 

certain of the company’s financing agreements have covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on the company and its subsidiaries 

certain of the company’s credit facilities and indentures governing its secured notes impose certain operating and financial covenants on the company on united and its subsidiaries or on continental and its subsidiaries such covenants require the company united or continental as applicable to maintain depending on the particular agreement minimum fixed charge coverage ratios minimum liquidity andor minimum collateral coverage ratios a decline in the value of collateral could result in a situation where the company united or continental as applicable may not be able to maintain the required collateral coverage ratio in addition the credit facilities and indentures contain other negative covenants customary for such financings 

the company’s ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond its control including the overall industry revenue environment and the level of fuel costs and the company may be required to seek waivers or amendments of covenants repay all or a portion of the debt or find alternative sources of financing the company cannot provide assurance that such waivers amendments or alternative financing could be obtained or if obtained would be on terms acceptable to the company if the company fails to comply with these covenants and is unable to obtain a waiver or amendment an event of default would result which would allow the lenders among other things to declare outstanding amounts due and payable the company cannot provide assurance that it would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance such amounts if they were to become due in addition an event of default or declaration of acceleration under any of the credit facilities or indentures could also result in an event of default under certain of the company’s other financing agreements due to crossdefault and crossacceleration provisions 

  

extensive government regulation could increase the company’s operating costs and restrict its ability to conduct its business 

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal oversight compliance with us and international regulations imposes significant costs and may have adverse effects on the company laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges both domestically and internationally have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce airline revenue the company cannot provide any assurance that current laws and regulations or laws or regulations enacted in the future will not adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations 

each of united and continental provides air transportation under certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by the dot if the dot altered amended modified suspended or revoked these certificates it could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business the dot is also responsible for promulgating consumer protection and other regulations that may impose significant compliance costs on the company the faa regulates the safety of united’s and continental’s operations united and continental are operators pursuant to a single air carrier operating certificate issued by the faa from time to time the faa also issues orders airworthiness directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require material expenditures or operational restrictions by the company these faa orders and directives could include the temporary grounding of an entire aircraft type if the faa identifies design manufacturing maintenance or other issues requiring immediate corrective action for example on january 11 2013 the faa announced a review of the boeing 787 aircraft’s critical systems and inservice issues and on january 16 2013 the faa issued an emergency airworthiness directive that requires us boeing 787 operators including the company to temporarily cease operations of such aircraft if the directive were to continue for an extended period of time it could adversely affect the company’s business and results of operations faa requirements cover among other things retirement of older aircraft security measures collision avoidance systems airborne windshear avoidance systems noise abatement and other environmental concerns aircraft operation and safety and increased inspections and maintenance procedures to be conducted on older aircraft these faa directives or requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company 

in addition the company’s operations may be adversely impacted due to the existing antiquated air traffic control “atc” system utilized by the us government during peak travel periods in certain markets the current atc system’s inability to handle existing travel demand has led to shortterm capacity constraints imposed by government agencies and resulted in delays and disruptions of air traffic in addition the current system will not be able to effectively handle projected future air traffic growth imposition of these atc constraints on a longterm basis may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations failure to update the atc system in a timely manner and the substantial funding requirements of a modernized atc system that may be imposed on air carriers may have an adverse impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

the airline industry is subject to extensive federal state and local taxes and fees that increase the cost of the company’s operations in addition to taxes and fees that the company is currently subject to proposed taxes and fees are currently pending and if imposed would increase the company’s operating expenses 

access to landing and takeoff rights or “slots” at several major us airports and many foreign airports served by the company are or recently have been subject to government regulation certain of the company’s major hubs are among increasingly congested airports in the united states and have been or could be the subject of regulatory action that might limit the number of flights andor increase costs of operations at certain times or throughout the day the faa may limit the company’s airport access by limiting the number of departure and arrival slots at high density traffic airports which could affect the company’s ownership and transfer rights and local airport authorities may have the ability to control access to certain facilities or the cost of access to its facilities which could have an adverse effect on the company’s business the faa historically has taken actions with respect to airlines’ slot holdings that airlines have challenged if the faa were to take actions to adversely affect the company’s slot holdings the company could incur substantial costs to preserve its slots further the company’s operating costs at airports at which it operates including the company’s major hubs may increase 

  

significantly because of capital improvements at such airports that the company may be required to fund directly or indirectly in some circumstances such costs could be imposed by the relevant airport authority without the company’s approval and may have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition 

the ability of carriers to operate flights on international routes between airports in the us and other countries may be subject to change applicable arrangements between the united states and foreign governments may be amended from time to time government policies with respect to airport operations may be revised and the availability of appropriate slots or facilities may change the company currently operates a number of flights on international routes under government arrangements regulations or policies that designate the number of carriers permitted to operate on such routes the capacity of the carriers providing services on such routes the airports at which carriers may operate international flights or the number of carriers allowed access to particular airports any further limitations additions or modifications to such arrangements regulations or policies could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations additionally if an open skies policy were to be adopted for any of the company’s international routes such an event could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial position and results of operations and could result in the impairment of material amounts of related tangible and intangible assets in addition competition from revenuesharing joint ventures and other alliance arrangements by and among other airlines could impair the value of the company’s business and assets on the open skies routes the company’s plans to enter into or expand us antitrust immunized alliances and joint ventures on various international routes are subject to receipt of approvals from applicable us federal authorities and obtaining other applicable foreign government clearances or satisfying the necessary applicable regulatory requirements there can be no assurance that such approvals and clearances will be granted or will continue in effect upon further regulatory review or that changes in regulatory requirements or standards can be satisfied 

many aspects of the company’s operations are also subject to increasingly stringent federal state local and international laws protecting the environment future environmental regulatory developments such as climate change regulations in the united states and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in the airline industry there are certain climate change laws and regulations that have already gone into effect and that apply to the company including the eu ets which is subject to international dispute the state of california’s cap and trade regulations environmental taxes for certain international flights limited greenhouse gas reporting requirements and landuse planning laws which could apply to airports and could affect airlines in certain circumstances in addition there is the potential for additional regulatory actions in regard to the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry the precise nature of future requirements and their applicability to the company are difficult to predict but the financial impact to the company and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant 

see item 1 business  industry regulation above for further information on government regulation impacting the company 

the company relies heavily on technology and automated systems to operate its business and any significant failure or disruption of the technology or these systems could materially harm its business 

the company depends on automated systems and technology to operate its business including computerized airline reservation systems flight operations systems telecommunication systems and commercial websites including wwwunitedcom united’s website and other automated systems must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic and deliver important flight and schedule information as well as process critical financial transactions these systems could suffer substantial or repeated disruptions due to events including natural disasters power failures terrorist attacks equipment or software failures computer viruses or cyber security attacks substantial or repeated website reservation systems or telecommunication systems failures or disruptions including failures or disruptions related to the company’s integration of technology systems could reduce the attractiveness of the company’s services versus those of its competitors materially impair its ability to market its services and operate its flights result in the unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and result in increased costs lost revenue and the loss or compromise of important data 

  

the company’s business relies extensively on thirdparty service providers failure of these parties to perform as expected or interruptions in the company’s relationships with these providers or their provision of services to the company could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the company has engaged an increasing number of thirdparty service providers to perform a large number of functions that are integral to its business including regional operations operation of customer service call centers distribution and sale of airline seat inventory provision of information technology infrastructure and services provision of aircraft maintenance and repairs provision of various utilities and performance of aircraft fueling operations among other vital functions and services the company does not directly control these thirdparty service providers although it does enter into agreements with many of them that define expected service performance any of these thirdparty service providers however may materially fail to meet their service performance commitments to the company or agreements with such providers may be terminated for example flight reservations booked by customers andor travel agencies via thirdparty gdss may be adversely affected by disruptions in the business relationships between the company and gds operators such disruptions including a failure to agree upon acceptable contract terms when contracts expire or otherwise become subject to renegotiation may cause the carriers’ flight information to be limited or unavailable for display significantly increase fees for both the company and gds users and impair the company’s relationships with its customers and travel agencies the failure of any of the company’s thirdparty service providers to adequately perform their service obligations or other interruptions of services may reduce the company’s revenues and increase its expenses or prevent the company from operating its flights and providing other services to its customers in addition the company’s business and financial performance could be materially harmed if its customers believe that its services are unreliable or unsatisfactory 

ual’s obligations for funding continental’s defined benefit pension plans are affected by factors beyond ual’s control 

continental has defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its us employees other than the employees of its chelsea food services division and continental micronesia inc the timing and amount of ual’s funding requirements under continental’s plans depend upon a number of factors including labor negotiations with the applicable employee groups and changes to pension plan benefits as well as factors outside of ual’s control such as the number of applicable retiring employees asset returns interest rates and changes in pension laws changes to these and other factors that can significantly increase ual’s funding requirements such as its liquidity requirements could have a material adverse effect on ual’s financial condition 

union disputes employee strikes or slowdowns and other laborrelated disruptions as well as the integration of the united and continental workforces in connection with the merger present the potential for a delay in achieving expected merger synergies could adversely affect the company’s operations and could result in increased costs that impair its financial performance 

united and continental are both highly unionized companies as of december 31 2012 the company and its subsidiaries had approximately 88000 active employees of whom approximately 80 were represented by various us labor organizations 

the successful integration of united and continental and achievement of the anticipated benefits of the combined company depend in part on integrating united and continental employee groups and maintaining productive employee relations in order to fully integrate the premerger represented employee groups the company must negotiate a joint collective bargaining agreement covering each combined group the process for integrating the labor groups of united and continental is governed by a combination of the rla the mccaskillbond amendment and where applicable the existing provisions of each company’s collective bargaining agreements and union policy a delay in or failure to integrate the united and continental employee groups presents the potential for delays in achieving expected merger synergies increased operating costs and labor disputes that could adversely affect our operations 

during 2012 various labor agreements were reached between union representatives and the company on december 15 2012 the pilots for both united and continental ratified a joint collective bargaining agreement 

  

with the company in february 2013 the company reached tentative agreements on new joint collective bargaining agreements with the iam for the fleet service passenger service and storekeeper workgroups at the united continental continental micronesia and mileage plus subsidiaries the tentative agreements with the iam cover more than 28000 employees and are subject to ratification by the iam members we are also currently in the process of negotiating joint collective bargaining agreements with all of our other major represented groups several other collective bargaining agreements were reached with unions at each of our subsidiaries during 2012 including with the united flight attendants in february 2012 the continental micronesia aircraft technicians in may 2012 the continental pilot ground instructors in june 2012 and the continental micronesia flight attendants in august 2012 

the company can provide no assurance that a successful or timely resolution of labor negotiations for all amendable collective bargaining agreements will be achieved there is a risk that unions or individual employees might pursue judicial or arbitral claims arising out of changes implemented as a result of the merger employee dissatisfaction with the results of the seniority integration may lead to litigation that in some cases can delay implementation of the integrated seniority list there is also a possibility that employees or unions could engage in job actions such as slowdowns worktorule campaigns sickouts or other actions designed to disrupt united’s and continental’s normal operations in an attempt to pressure the companies in collective bargaining negotiations although the rla makes such actions unlawful until the parties have been lawfully released to selfhelp and united and continental can seek injunctive relief against premature selfhelp such actions can cause significant harm even if ultimately enjoined in addition achieving joint collective bargaining agreements including the pilot agreement with our represented employee groups is likely to increase our labor costs which increase could be material 

the airline industry is highly competitive and susceptible to price discounting and changes in capacity which could have a material adverse effect on the company 

the us airline industry is characterized by substantial price competition in recent years the market share held by lowcost carriers has increased significantly and is expected to continue to increase the increased market presence of lowcost carriers which engage in substantial price discounting has diminished the ability of large network carriers to achieve sustained profitability on domestic and international routes 

airlines also compete for market share by increasing or decreasing their capacity including route systems and the number of markets served several of the company’s domestic and international competitors have increased their international capacity by including service to some destinations that the company currently serves causing overlap in destinations served and therefore increasing competition for those destinations in addition the company and certain of its competitors have implemented significant capacity reductions in recent years in response to high and volatile fuel prices and stagnant global economic growth further certain of the company’s competitors may not reduce capacity or may increase capacity impacting the expected benefit to the company from capacity reductions this increased competition in both domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

the airline industry may undergo further bankruptcy restructuring industry consolidation or the creation or modification of alliances or joint ventures any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company 

the company faces and may continue to face strong competition from other carriers due to bankruptcy restructuring industry consolidation and the creation and modification of alliances and joint ventures a number of carriers have filed for bankruptcy protection in recent years and other domestic and international carriers could restructure in bankruptcy or threaten to do so in the future to reduce their costs most recently amr corporation the parent company of american airlines inc filed for bankruptcy protection in november 2011 and is currently under going a restructuring under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code carriers operating under bankruptcy protection can operate in a manner that could be adverse to the company and could emerge from bankruptcy as more vigorous competitors 

both the us and international airline industries have experienced consolidation through a number of mergers and acquisitions on february 14 2013 us airways announced an agreement to merge with amr corporation 

  

and its intent to exit star alliance as a result of such merger the company is also facing stronger competition from expanded airline alliances and joint ventures carriers may improve their competitive positions through airline alliances slot swaps andor joint ventures certain airline joint ventures further competition by allowing airlines to coordinate routes pool revenues and costs and enjoy other mutual benefits achieving many of the benefits of consolidation “open skies” agreements including the agreements between the united states and the european union and between the united states and japan may also give rise to additional consolidation or better integration opportunities among international carriers 

there is ongoing speculation that further airline consolidations or reorganizations could occur in the future the company routinely engages in analysis and discussions regarding its own strategic position including alliances asset acquisitions and divestitures and may have future discussions with other airlines regarding strategic activities if other airlines participate in such activities those airlines may significantly improve their cost structures or revenue generation capabilities thereby potentially making them stronger competitors of the company and potentially impairing the company’s ability to realize expected benefits from its own strategic relationships 

increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage may materially and adversely impact the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

following the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 the company’s insurance costs increased significantly and the availability of thirdparty war risk terrorism insurance decreased significantly the company has obtained thirdparty war risk terrorism insurance through a special program administered by the faa should the government discontinue this coverage obtaining comparable coverage from commercial underwriters could result in substantially higher premiums and more restrictive terms if such coverage is available at all if the company is unable to obtain adequate thirdparty war risk terrorism insurance its business could be materially and adversely affected 

if any of the company’s aircraft were to be involved in an accident or if the company’s property or operations were to be affected by a significant natural catastrophe or other event the company could be exposed to significant liability or loss if the company is unable to obtain sufficient insurance including aviation hull and liability insurance and property and business interruption coverage to cover such liabilities or losses whether due to insurance market conditions or otherwise its results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

the company could experience adverse publicity harm to its brand reduced travel demand and potential tort liability as a result of an accident catastrophe or incident involving its aircraft the aircraft of its regional carriers or the aircraft of its codeshare partners which may result in a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial position 

an accident catastrophe or incident involving an aircraft that the company operates or an aircraft that is operated by a codeshare partner or one of the company’s regional carriers could have a material adverse effect on the company if such accident catastrophe or incident created a public perception that the company’s operations or the operations of its codeshare partners or regional carriers are not safe or reliable or less safe or reliable than other airlines such public perception could in turn result in adverse publicity for the company cause harm to the company’s brand and reduce travel demand on the company’s flights or the flights of its codeshare partners or regional carriers 

in addition any such accident catastrophe or incident could expose the company to significant tort liability although the company currently maintains liability insurance in amounts and of the type the company believes to be consistent with industry practice to cover damages arising from any such accident or catastrophe and the company’s codeshare partners and regional carriers carry similar insurance and generally indemnify the company for their operations if the company’s liability exceeds the applicable policy limits or the ability of another carrier to indemnify it the company could incur substantial losses from an accident catastrophe or incident which may result in a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial position 

  

the company’s results of operations fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors associated with the airline industry 

due to greater demand for air travel during the spring and summer months revenues in the airline industry in the second and third quarters of the year are generally stronger than revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year which are periods of lower travel demand the company’s results of operations generally reflect this seasonality but have also been impacted by numerous other factors that are not necessarily seasonal including among others the imposition of excise and similar taxes extreme or severe weather air traffic control congestion geological events natural disasters changes in the competitive environment due to industry consolidation general economic conditions and other factors as a result the company’s quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year and historical operating results in a quarterly or annual period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 

terrorist attacks or international hostilities or the fear of terrorist attacks or hostilities even if not made directly on the airline industry could negatively affect the company and the airline industry 

the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 involving commercial aircraft severely and adversely impacted each of united’s and continental’s financial condition and results of operations as well as the prospects for the airline industry among the effects experienced from the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks were substantial flight disruption costs caused by the faaimposed temporary grounding of the us airline industry’s fleet significantly increased security costs and associated passenger inconvenience increased insurance costs substantially higher ticket refunds and significantly decreased traffic and passenger revenue 

additional terrorist attacks even if not made directly on the airline industry or the fear of or the precautions taken in anticipation of such attacks including elevated national threat warnings or selective cancellation or redirection of flights could materially and adversely affect the company and the airline industry wars and other international hostilities could also have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition liquidity and results of operations the company’s financial resources may not be sufficient to absorb the adverse effects of any future terrorist attacks or other international hostilities 

an outbreak of a disease or similar public health threat could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business financial position and results of operations 

an outbreak of a disease or similar public health threat that affects travel demand or travel behavior or travel restrictions or reduction in the demand for air travel caused by an outbreak of a disease or similar public health threat in the future could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

the company may never realize the full value of its intangible assets or its longlived assets causing it to record impairments that may negatively affect its financial position and results of operations 

in accordance with applicable accounting standards the company is required to test its indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis on october 1 of each year or more frequently if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred in addition the company is required to test certain of its other assets for impairment if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred 

the company may be required to recognize impairments in the future due to among other factors extreme fuel price volatility tight credit markets a decline in the fair value of certain tangible or intangible assets unfavorable trends in historical or forecasted results of operations and cash flows and an uncertain economic environment as well as other uncertainties the company can provide no assurance that a material impairment charge of tangible or intangible assets will not occur in a future period the value of our aircraft could be impacted in future periods by changes in supply and demand for these aircraft such changes in supply and demand for certain aircraft types could result from grounding of aircraft by the company or other carriers an impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

  

the company’s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for us federal income tax purposes may be significantly limited due to various circumstances including certain possible future transactions involving the sale or issuance of ual common stock or if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels 

as of december 31 2012 ual reported consolidated federal net operating loss “nol” carryforwards of approximately 10 billion 

the company’s ability to use its nol carryforwards may be limited if it experiences an “ownership change” as defined in section 382 “section 382” of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended an ownership change generally occurs if certain stockholders increase their aggregate percentage ownership of a corporation’s stock by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest percentage ownership at any time during the testing period which is generally the threeyear period preceding any potential ownership change 

there is no assurance that the company will not experience a future ownership change under section 382 that may significantly limit or possibly eliminate its ability to use its nol carryforwards potential future transactions involving the sale or issuance of ual common stock including the exercise of conversion options under the terms of the company’s convertible debt repurchase of such debt with ual common stock issuance of ual common stock for cash and the acquisition or disposition of such stock by a stockholder owning 5 or more of ual common stock or a combination of such transactions may increase the possibility that the company will experience a future ownership change under section 382 

under section 382 a future ownership change would subject the company to additional annual limitations that apply to the amount of preownership change nols that may be used to offset postownership change taxable income this limitation is generally determined by multiplying the value of a corporation’s stock immediately before the ownership change by the applicable longterm taxexempt rate any unused annual limitation may subject to certain limits be carried over to later years and the limitation may under certain circumstances be increased by builtin gains in the assets held by such corporation at the time of the ownership change this limitation could cause the company’s us federal income taxes to be greater or to be paid earlier than they otherwise would be and could cause all or a portion of the company’s nol carryforwards to expire unused similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes the company’s ability to use its nol carryforwards will also depend on the amount of taxable income it generates in future periods its nol carryforwards may expire before the company can generate sufficient taxable income to use them in full 

ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation limits certain transfers of its stock which could have an effect on the market price of ual common stock 

to reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect on the company’s ability to use its nol carryforwards for federal income tax purposes ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains a 5 ownership limitation this limitation generally remains effective until february 1 2014 or until such later date as may be approved by the ual board of directors the “board of directors” in its sole discretion the limitation prohibits i an acquisition by a single stockholder of shares that results in that stockholder owning 5 or more of ual common stock and ii any acquisition or disposition of common stock by a stockholder that already owns 5 or more of ual common stock unless prior written approval is granted by the board of directors 

any transfer of common stock in violation of these restrictions will be void and will be treated as if such transfer never occurred this provision of ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation may impair or prevent a sale of common stock by a stockholder and adversely affect the price at which a stockholder can sell ual common stock in addition this limitation may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the company creating a perception that a change in control cannot occur or otherwise discouraging takeover attempts that some stockholders may consider beneficial which could also adversely affect the market price of the ual common stock the company cannot predict the effect that this provision in ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation may have on the market price of the ual common stock for additional information regarding the 5 ownership limitation please refer to ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation available on the company’s website 

  

certain provisions of ual’s governance documents could discourage or delay changes of control or changes to the board of directors 

certain provisions of ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws together the “governance documents” may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the board of directors and may discourage takeover attempts that some of its stockholders may consider beneficial 

certain provisions of the governance documents may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if the board of directors determines that such changes in control are not in the best interests of ual and its stockholders these provisions of the governance documents are not intended to prevent a takeover but are intended to protect and maximize the value of ual’s stockholders’ interests while these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of ual to negotiate with the board of directors they could enable the board of directors to prevent a transaction that some or a majority of its stockholders might believe to be in their best interests or they could prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

the issuance of additional shares of ual’s capital stock including the issuance of common stock upon conversion of convertible notes and upon a noteholder’s exercise of its option to require ual to repurchase convertible notes could cause dilution to the interests of its existing stockholders 

ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes up to one billion shares of common stock in certain circumstances ual can issue shares of common stock without stockholder approval in addition the board of directors is authorized to issue up to 250 million shares of preferred stock without par value without any action on the part of ual’s stockholders the board of directors also has the power without stockholder approval to set the terms of any series of shares of preferred stock that may be issued including voting rights conversion rights dividend rights preferences over ual’s common stock with respect to dividends or if ual liquidates dissolves or winds up its business and other terms if ual issues preferred stock in the future that has a preference over its common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon its liquidation dissolution or winding up or if ual issues preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of its common stock the rights of holders of its common stock or the market price of its common stock could be adversely affected 

the company is also authorized to issue without stockholder approval other securities convertible into either preferred stock or in certain circumstances common stock as of december 31 2012 ual had 1 billion of convertible debt outstanding holders of these securities may convert them into shares of ual common stock according to their terms in addition certain of ual’s notes include noteholder early redemption options if a noteholder exercises such option ual may elect to pay the repurchase price in cash shares of its common stock or a combination thereof see note 14 to the financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information related to these convertible notes the number of shares issued could be significant and such an issuance could cause significant dilution to the interests of its existing stockholders in addition if ual elects to pay the repurchase price in cash its liquidity could be adversely affected 

in the future ual may decide to raise additional capital through offerings of ual common stock securities convertible into ual common stock or exercise rights to acquire these securities or its common stock the issuance of additional shares of common stock including upon the conversion or repurchase of convertible debt could result in significant dilution of existing stockholders’ equity interests in ual issuances of substantial amounts of its common stock or the perception that such issuances could occur may adversely affect prevailing market prices for ual’s common stock and ual cannot predict the effect this dilution may have on the price of its common stock

2012 financial highlights 

 

  

  

  

 2012 operational highlights 

 

  

  

 set forth below is a discussion of the principal matters that we believe could impact our financial and operating performance and cause our results of operations in future periods to differ materially from our historical operating results andor from our anticipated results of operations described in the forwardlooking statements in this report see item 1a risk factors  and the factors described under “forwardlooking information” for further discussion of these and other factors that could affect us 

merger integration during 2012 the company made significant progress in integrating its products services policies and a number of information technology systems following the conversion of its passenger service system in march 2012 the company now has a single passenger service system a single loyalty program mileageplus and a single website unitedcom continental’s onepass loyalty program formally ended in the first quarter of 2012 at which point united automatically enrolled onepass members in the mileageplus program and 

  

deposited into those mileageplus accounts award miles equal to onepass members’ award miles balance as a result of the conversion to a single passenger service system the company now operates using a single reservations system carrier code flight schedule website and departure control system 

the company continued to redeploy aircraft across its global network better matching aircraft and demand on a route by route basis 

the united and continental pilots represented by the air line pilots association international “alpa” ratified a new joint collective bargaining agreement with the company 

some key initiatives for the company in 2013 include maintaining reliable operational performance investing in customer service training and tools for its frontline coworkers completing the installation of flatbed seats in the premium cabins of its international widebody aircraft installing global satellite based wifi on approximately 300 of its mainline aircraft and reaching competitive joint collective bargaining agreements with its unionrepresented employee groups 

ual expects the merger to deliver 10 billion to 12 billion in net annual synergies on a runrate basis when the integration is complete and synergy benefits are fully realized 

the company has incurred substantial expenses in connection with the merger the company incurred approximately 739 million of integrationrelated cash costs in 2012 and expects this amount to decrease significantly in 2013 to approximately 250 million there are many factors that could affect the total amount or the timing of those expenses and many of the expenses that will be incurred are by their nature difficult to estimate accurately see notes 1 and 21 to the financial statements included in item 8 of this report and item 1a risk factors for additional information on the merger 

the company plans to merge united air lines inc and continental airlines inc into one legal entity in 2013 once this legal merger occurs the financial statements of united and continental will be combined at their historical cost for all periods presented beginning on october 1 2010 the date on which continental became a whollyowned subsidiary of ual and there will no longer be a requirement to separately report the historical financial statements of continental 

economic conditions the economic outlook for the aviation industry in 2013 is characterized by stagnant to modest us and global economic growth we cannot predict whether the demand for air travel will improve or the rate of such improvement continuing economic uncertainty including continued european sovereign debt uncertainty and political and socioeconomic tensions in regions such as the middle east may result in diminished demand for air travel and may impair our ability to achieve profitability in 2013 

capacity over the past year ual leveraged the flexibility of its combined fleet to better match market demand and added new routes from its hubs to international destinations such as istanbul turkey manchester england dublin ireland buenos aires argentina monterrey mexico san salvador el salvador kelowna british columbia canada and doha qatar via dubai united arab emirates in addition for 2013 ual expects to add new routes from its hubs to taipei taiwan shannon ireland paris france edmonton alberta canada fort mcmurray alberta canada thunder bay ontario canada and denver’s first service to asia with nonstop service to tokyo subject to government approval we expect consolidated capacity for 2013 to be lower than consolidated capacity in 2012 should fuel prices increase significantly or should us or global economic growth outlooks decline substantially we would likely adjust our capacity plans to reflect the different operating environment 

fuel costs fuel prices continued to be volatile in 2012 ual’s average aircraft fuel price per gallon including related taxes was 327 in 2012 as compared to 306 in 2011 if fuel prices rise significantly from their current levels we may be unable to raise fares or other fees sufficiently to fully offset our increased costs in addition high fuel prices may impair our ability to achieve profitability based on projected fuel consumption in 2013 a one dollar change in the price of a barrel of crude oil would change ual’s annual fuel expense by approximately 94 million to protect against increases in the prices of aircraft fuel the company routinely hedges a portion of its future fuel requirements 

  

labor costs as of december 31 2012 the company had approximately 80 of employees represented by unions we are in the process of negotiating amended collective bargaining agreements with our major employee groups the company cannot predict the outcome of negotiations with its unionized employee groups although significant increases in the pay and benefits resulting from new collective bargaining agreements would have an adverse financial impact on the company 

in 2013 the company expects casm excluding fuel profit sharing and thirdparty business expense to increase 45 to 55 yearoveryear of which approximately 25 percentage points are due to collective bargaining agreements with various employee groups 

results of operations 

in this section we compare ual’s results of operations for the year ended december 31 2012 with ual’s results of operations for the year ended december 31 2011 this presentation differs from the comparison of 2011 and 2010 results which compares ual’s financial performance yearoveryear excluding the merger impact in 2010 represented by continental successor results in the fourth quarter of 2010 nongaap financial measures are presented because they provide management and investors with the ability to measure and monitor ual’s performance on a consistent basis 

2012 compared to 2011 

operating revenue 

the table below illustrates the yearoveryear percentage change in ual’s operating revenues for the years ended december 31 in millions except percentage changes 

 

 the table below presents ual’s passenger revenues and operating data based on geographic region regional flights consist primarily of domestic routes 

 

  a see item 6 for the definition of these statistics 

  

consolidated passenger revenue in 2012 increased approximately 72 million or 02 as compared to 2011 this increase was due to an increase of 12 in both average fare per passenger and yield over the same period as a result of improved pricing primarily from industry capacity discipline offset by a 1 decline in passengers the reduced traffic from both business and leisure passengers in 2012 was offset by higher fares which drove improvements in both average fare per passenger and yield 

cargo revenue decreased by 149 million or 128 in 2012 as compared to 2011 due to excess industry capacity and a weaker demand environment both cargo volume and yield declined in 2012 compared to 2011 freight revenue in 2012 decreased 134 compared to 2011 due to lower volume fuel surcharges and processing fees mail revenue decreased 81 in 2012 as compared to 2011 primarily due to lower volume 

revenue in 2011 was also impacted by certain accounting changes as described in note 2 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report in conjunction with these accounting changes the company recorded a special adjustment in 2011 to decrease frequent flyer deferred revenue and increase revenue by 107 million in connection with a modification to the consolidated amended and restated cobranded card marketing services agreement dated june 9 2011 the “cobrand agreement” with chase bank usa na “chase” 

other operating revenue was up 226 million or 68 in 2012 as compared to 2011 which was primarily due to a change in the deferral rate related to the sales of credit card miles in conjunction with the modification of the cobrand agreement in accordance with accounting standards update 200913 multipledeliverable revenue arrangements  a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force “asu 200913” which was adopted in 2011 other operating revenue also increased due to additional sales of aircraft fuel to a third party 

operating expense 

the table below includes data related to ual’s operating expense for the year ended december 31 in millions except percentage changes 

 

   

the significant increase in aircraft fuel expense was primarily attributable to increased fuel prices and gains losses from fuel hedging activity in both years as shown in the table below which reflects the significant changes in aircraft fuel cost per gallon for 2012 as compared to 2011 

 

  

a includes gains losses from settled hedges that were designated for hedge accounting 

b includes ineffectiveness gains losses and gains losses on derivatives not designated for hedge accounting these amounts are recorded in nonoperating income expense miscellaneous net 

c includes ineffectiveness gains losses and noncash marktomarket gains losses on all open fuel hedge positions these amounts are recorded in nonoperating income expense miscellaneous net 

salaries and related costs increased 293 million or 38 in 2012 as compared to 2011 the increase was due to several factors including a 35 increase in the number of average fulltime employees yearoveryear higher pay rates primarily driven by new collective bargaining agreements pension costs and overtime for airport and call center employees related to our conversion to a single passenger service system the increase was offset by a decrease in profit sharing and lower workers’ compensation and longterm disability 

distribution expenses decreased 83 million or 58 in 2012 as compared to 2011 due to reduced fees with our online ticket agents lower credit card discount fees driven by legislation reducing costs on debit card sales and lower volume of global distribution fees paid 

other operating expenses increased 78 million or 17 in 2012 as compared to 2011 due to additional trip interruption costs costs associated with higher fuel sales hotel and per diem expenses personnelrelated expenses and higher advertising expenses 

  

the table below presents integrationrelated costs and special items incurred by ual during the years ended december 31 in millions 

 

 integrationrelated costs include compensation costs related to systems integration and training costs to repaint aircraft in the new livery and other branding activities costs to writeoff or accelerate depreciation on systems and facilities that are no longer used or planned to be used for significantly shorter periods and relocation costs for employees and severance primarily associated with administrative headcount reductions 

on december 31 2012 ual and united entered into an agreement with the pension benefit guaranty corporation the “pbgc” that reduced the aggregate amount of 8 contingent senior notes to be issued by ual and eliminated the contingent nature of such obligation by replacing the 188 million principal amount of 8 contingent senior notes incurred as of december 31 2012 and the obligation to issue any additional 8 contingent senior notes with 400 million principal amount of new 8 notes due 2024 the “new 8 notes” in addition ual and united agreed to replace the 652 million principal amount outstanding of ual’s 6 senior notes due 2031 with 326 million principal amount of new 6 notes due 2026 and 326 million principal amount of 6 notes due 2028 collectively the “new 6 notes” and together with the new 8 notes the “new pbgc notes” the company did not receive any cash proceeds in connection with the issuance of the new pbgc notes the company is accounting for this agreement as a debt extinguishment resulting in a charge of 309 million that represents the fair value of 212 million of new 8 notes that it agreed to issue and the change in the fair value of the new 6 notes and the 188 million of new 8 notes versus their previous carrying values the company classified the expense as a component of special charges because the note restructuring would not have occurred if it were not for the merger 

the company also recorded impairment charges related to european takeoff and landing slots primarily due to the weakening of the us dollar against certain foreign currencies and reductions in scheduled flights in addition the company recorded additional costs associated with the ratification of the joint collective bargaining agreement by the united and continental pilots represented by alpa the company also recorded charges associated with various voluntary retirement and leave of absence programs for its various employee groups see note 21 to the financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information related to special items

the following is a discussion of ual’s sources and uses of cash from 2010 to 2012 as ual applied the acquisition method of accounting to the merger ual’s cash activities discussed below include continental’s activities only after october 1 2010 

cash flows from operating activities 

2012 compared to 2011 

ual’s cash from operating activities decreased by 15 billion in 2012 as compared to 2011 cash from operations declined due to the company’s net loss position and the reduction of frequent flyer deferred revenue and advanced purchase of miles by 712 million in 2012 

2011 compared to 2010 

ual’s cash from operating activities increased by 501 million in 2011 as compared to 2010 cash from operations improved due to the company’s improved operational performance in 2011 the company’s increased revenues were offset in part by higher cash operating expenses resulting from the merger including fuel and aircraft maintenance expense 

  

cash flows from investing activities 

2012 compared to 2011 

ual’s capital expenditures including aircraft purchase deposits were 2 billion and 840 million in 2012 and 2011 respectively ual’s capital expenditures for 2012 were primarily attributable to the purchase of new boeing aircraft and other fleetrelated expenditures to improve the onboard experience of our existing aircraft 

ual increased its shortterm investments net of proceeds by 245 million in 2012 in order to improve interest income 

2011 compared to 2010 

ual’s capital expenditures including aircraft purchase deposits were 840 million and 416 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively approximately half of the capital expenditures in 2011 related to aircraft upgrades across the company’s fleet for its international premium travel product as well as various facility and ground equipment projects some of these capital expenditures relate to improvements to assets as a result of the merger also in 2011 the company purchased nine aircraft that were operated under leases for 88 million and were immediately sold to third parties upon acquisition for proceeds of 72 million 

in december 2011 united cash collateralized 194 million of its letters of credit that had previously been issued and collateralized under the amended credit facility resulting in an increase in restricted cash 

ual increased its shortterm investments net of proceeds by 898 million in 2011 as compared to 2010 this was primarily due to the placement of additional funds with outside money managers and movement of liquid assets from cash to shortterm investments united’s shortterm investments net of proceeds increased by 269 million while continental’s shortterm investments net of proceeds increased by 629 million in 2011 as compared to 2010

credit ratings as of the filing date of this report ual united and continental had the following corporate credit ratings 

 

 these credit ratings are below investment grade levels downgrades from these rating levels among other things could restrict the availability andor increase the cost of future financing for the company 

other liquidity matters 

below is a summary of additional liquidity matters see the indicated notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this report for additional details related to these and other matters affecting our liquidity and commitments 

 

 covenants certain of the company’s financing agreements have covenants that impose certain operating and financial restrictions as applicable on the company on united and its material subsidiaries or on continental and its subsidiaries 

among other covenants ual united and certain of united’s subsidiaries are guarantors under the amended credit facility and are required to maintain the minimum of the following as set forth below 

 

 additionally the revolving credit facility requires the company to maintain the minimum of the following as set forth below 

 

 among other covenants the indenture governing continental’s 675 senior secured notes due 2015 the “senior notes” requires the issuer to maintain a minimum ratio of collateral value to debt obligations as of certain reference periods if the value of the collateral underlying the senior notes declines such that continental no longer maintains the minimum required ratio of collateral value to debt obligations continental may be required to pay additional interest at the rate of 2 per annum provide additional collateral to secure the noteholders’ lien or repay a portion of the senior notes 

  

the amended and restated indenture for the new pbgc notes which are unsecured contains covenants that among other things restrict the ability of ual and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness and pay dividends on or repurchase stock these covenants cease to be in effect when the indenture covering the senior notes is discharged however if ual at that time or thereafter has a series of public debt securities with a principal amount of 300 million or more that has the benefit of covenants that are substantially similar to those contained in the indenture for the new pbgc notes then subject to certain conditions and upon written request of the pbgc to ual ual and united will use commercially reasonable efforts to amend the indenture for the new pbgc notes to include such covenants 

a breach of certain of the covenants or restrictions contained in the amended credit facility the revolving credit facility the indenture governing the senior notes or certain other debt instruments could result in a default and a subsequent acceleration of the applicable debt obligations the indenture governing the senior notes contains a crossdefault provision that would be triggered if continental were to fail to make payment when due with respect to certain obligations regarding frequent flyer miles purchased by chase under the company’s cobrand agreement the revolving credit facility includes events of default customary for similar financings in addition the amended credit facility and the revolving credit facility contain crossdefault andor crossacceleration provisions pursuant to which default andor acceleration of certain other material indebtedness of the company could result in a default under the amended credit facility the revolving credit facility or both 

the company has agreements with financial institutions that process customer credit card transactions for the sale of air travel and other services under certain of the company’s credit card processing agreements the financial institutions either require or under certain circumstances have the right to require that the company maintains a reserve equal to a portion of advance ticket sales that has been processed by that financial institution but for which the company has not yet provided the air transportation such financial institutions may require additional cash or other collateral reserves to be established or additional withholding of payments related to receivables collected if the company does not maintain certain minimum levels of unrestricted cash cash equivalents and short term investments the company’s current level of unrestricted cash cash equivalents and short term investments is substantially in excess of these minimum levels 

capital commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements the company’s business is capital intensive requiring significant amounts of capital to fund the acquisition of assets particularly aircraft in the past the company has funded the acquisition of aircraft through outright purchase by issuing debt by entering into capital or operating leases or through vendor financings the company also often enters into longterm lease commitments with airports to ensure access to terminal cargo maintenance and other required facilities 

the table below provides a summary of ual’s material contractual obligations as of december 31 2012 in billions 

 

   

      contingencies 

continental eetcs 

in october 2012 continental created two passthrough trusts one of which issued 712 million aggregate principal amount of class a passthrough certificates with a stated interest rate of 4 and the second of which issued 132 million aggregate principal amount of class b passthrough certificates with a stated interest rate of 55 the proceeds of the issuance of the class a and class b passthrough certificates which amounted to 844 million are used to purchase equipment notes issued by continental of the 844 million in proceeds raised by the passthrough trusts continental received 293 million as of december 31 2012 continental expects to receive the remaining proceeds from the issuance during the first seven months of 2013 as aircraft are delivered to continental and continental issues equipment notes to the trusts continental records the debt obligation upon issuance of the equipment notes rather than upon the initial issuance of the passthrough certificates the proceeds have been and are expected to be used to fund the acquisition of new aircraft 

in december 2012 continental created one passthrough trust which issued 425 million aggregate principal amount of class c passthrough certificates with a stated interest rate of 6125 the proceeds of the issuance of the class c passthrough certificates are used to purchase equipment notes issued by continental related to the aircraft financed in both the march and october 2012 eetc financings of the 425 million in proceeds raised by the passthrough trusts continental had received 278 million as of december 31 2012 continental expects to receive the remaining proceeds from the issuance during the first seven months of 2013 as aircraft are delivered to continental and continental issues equipment notes to the trusts continental records the debt obligation upon issuance of the equipment notes rather than upon the initial issuance of the passthrough certificates 

the company evaluated whether the passthrough trusts formed are variable interest entities “vies” required to be consolidated by the company under applicable accounting guidance and determined that the passthrough trusts are vies the company determined that it does not have a variable interest in the passthrough trusts the company does not invest in or obtain a financial interest in the passthrough trusts rather continental has an obligation to make interest and principal payments on its equipment notes held by the passthrough trusts the company did not intend to have any voting or nonvoting equity interest in the passthrough trusts or to absorb variability from the passthrough trusts based on this analysis the company determined that it is not required to consolidate the passthrough trusts 

legal and environmental the company has certain contingencies resulting from litigation and claims incident to the ordinary course of business management believes after considering a number of factors including but not limited to the information currently available the views of legal counsel the nature of contingencies to 

  

which the company is subject and prior experience that the ultimate disposition of the litigation and claims will not materially affect the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations the company records liabilities for legal and environmental claims when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable these amounts are recorded based on the company’s assessments of the likelihood of their eventual disposition 

many aspects of the company’s operations are subject to increasingly stringent federal state and local and international laws protecting the environment future environmental regulatory developments such as climate change regulations in the us and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in the airline industry 

there are certain laws and regulations relating to climate change that apply to the company including the european union emissions trading scheme which is subject to international dispute environmental taxes for certain international flights including the united kingdom’s air passenger duty and germany’s departure ticket tax limited greenhouse gas reporting requirements and the state of california’s cap and trade regulations which impacts united’s san francisco maintenance center in addition there are landbased planning laws that could apply to airport expansion projects requiring a review of greenhouse gas emissions and could affect airlines in certain circumstances 

offbalance sheet arrangements an offbalance sheet arrangement is any transaction agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has 1 made guarantees 2 a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets 3 an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or 4 any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support or that engages in leasing hedging or research and development arrangements the company’s primary offbalance sheet arrangements include operating leases which are summarized in the contractual obligations table in capital commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements above and certain municipal bond obligations as discussed below 

as of december 31 2012 united had cash collateralized 77 million of letters of credit most of which had previously been issued under the amended credit facility united also had 300 million of performance bonds continental had letters of credit and performance bonds relating to various real estate customs and aircraft financing obligations at december 31 2012 in the amount of approximately 67 million most of the letters of credit have evergreen clauses and are expected to be renewed on an annual basis and the performance bonds have expiration dates through 2016 

as of december 31 2012 united and continental are the guarantors of approximately 270 million and 16 billion respectively in aggregate principal amount of taxexempt special facilities revenue bonds and interest thereon these bonds issued by various airport municipalities are payable solely from rentals paid under longterm agreements with the respective governing bodies the leasing arrangements associated with a majority of these obligations are accounted for as operating leases and are not recorded in united’s and continental’s financial statements the leasing arrangements associated with a minority of these obligations are accounted for as capital leases the annual lease payments for those obligations accounted for as operating leases are included in the operating lease payments in the contractual obligations table in capital commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements above 

increased cost provisions in the company’s financing transactions that include loans the company typically agrees to reimburse lenders for any reduced returns with respect to the loans due to any change in capital requirements and in the case of loans in which the interest rate is based on libor for certain other increased costs that the lenders incur in carrying these loans as a result of any change in law subject in most cases to certain mitigation obligations of the lenders at december 31 2012 ual had 26 billion of floating rate debt consisting of united’s 19 billion and continental’s 658 million of debt and 347 million of fixed rate debt consisting of united’s 186 million and continental’s 161 million of debt with remaining terms of up to ten years that are subject to these increased cost provisions in several financing transactions involving loans or leases from nonus entities with remaining terms of up to nine years and an aggregate balance of 28   billion consisting of united’s 21 billion and continental’s 744 million balance we bear the risk of any change in tax laws that would subject loan or lease payments thereunder to nonus entities to withholding taxes subject to customary exclusions 

  

fuel consortia the company participates in numerous fuel consortia with other carriers at major airports to reduce the costs of fuel distribution and storage interline agreements govern the rights and responsibilities of the consortia members and provide for the allocation of the overall costs to operate the consortia based on usage the consortia and in limited cases the participating carriers have entered into longterm agreements to lease certain airport fuel storage and distribution facilities that are typically financed through taxexempt bonds either special facilities lease revenue bonds or general airport revenue bonds issued by various local municipalities in general each consortium lease agreement requires the consortium to make lease payments in amounts sufficient to pay the maturing principal and interest payments on the bonds as of december 31 2012 approximately 13 billion principal amount of such bonds were secured by significant fuel facility leases in which ual participates as to which ual and each of the signatory airlines have provided indirect guarantees of the debt as of december 31 2012 ual’s contingent exposure was approximately 259 million principal amount of such bonds based on its recent consortia participation as of december 31 2012 united’s and continental’s contingent exposure related to these bonds based on its recent consortia participation was approximately 198 million and 61 million respectively the company’s contingent exposure could increase if the participation of other air carriers decreases the guarantees will expire when the taxexempt bonds are paid in full which range from 2014 to 2041 the company did not record a liability at the time these indirect guarantees were made

fees charged in association with changes or extensions to nonrefundable tickets are recorded as other revenue at the time the fee is collected the fare on the changed ticket including any additional collection is deferred and recognized in accordance with our transportation revenue recognition policy at the time the transportation is provided change fees related to nonrefundable tickets are considered a separate transaction from the air transportation because they represent a charge for the company’s additional service to modify a previous sale therefore the pricing of the change fee and the initial customer reservation are separately determined and represent distinct earnings processes refundable tickets expire after one year 

the company records an estimate of breakage revenue for tickets that will expire in twelve months without usage these estimates are based on the evaluation of actual historical results the company recognizes cargo and other revenue as service is provided see separate discussion in frequent flyer accounting below 

frequent flyer accounting 

frequent flyer accounting the company has a frequent flyer program that is designed to increase customer loyalty program participants earn mileage credits “miles” by flying on united or continental and certain other participating airlines program participants can also earn miles through purchases from other nonairline partners that participate in the company’s loyalty program we sell miles to these partners which include credit card issuers retail merchants hotels car rental companies and our participating airline partners miles can be redeemed for free discounted or upgraded air travel and nontravel awards the company records its obligation for future award redemptions using a deferred revenue model 

miles earned in conjunction with flights in the case of the sale of air services the company recognizes a portion of the ticket sales as revenue when the air transportation occurs and defers a portion of the ticket sale representing the value of the related miles 

in accordance with asu 200913 the company determines the estimated selling price of the air transportation and miles as if each element is sold on a separate basis the total consideration from each ticket sale is then allocated to each of these elements individually on a pro rata basis the company revised the estimated selling price of miles as a prospective change in estimate effective january 1 2012 and it is based on the price we sell miles to star alliance partners in our reciprocal frequent flyer agreements as the best estimate of selling price for these miles any changes to the composition of star alliance airline partners may result in the existing estimated selling price of air transportation miles no longer being representative of the best estimate of selling price and could result in a change to the amount and method we use to determine the estimated selling price on february 14 2013 us airways announced an agreement to merge with amr corporation and its intent to exit star alliance as a result of such merger we are currently unable to estimate the timing or amount of any changes to estimated selling price as a result of this merger 

  

cobranded credit card partner mileage sales united also has a significant contract to sell frequent flyer miles to its cobranded credit card partner chase in june 2011 this contract was modified and the company entered into the cobrand agreement with chase the company identified five revenue elements in the cobrand agreement the air transportation element represented by the value of the mile generally resulting from its redemption for future air transportation use of the united brand and access to frequent flyer member lists advertising baggage services and airport lounge usage together excluding “the air transportation element” the “marketingrelated deliverables” 

the fair value of the elements is determined using management’s estimated selling price of each element the objective of using the estimated selling price based methodology is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis accordingly we determine our best estimate of selling price by considering multiple inputs and methods including but not limited to discounted cash flows brand value volume discounts published selling prices number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed the company estimated the selling prices and volumes over the term of the cobrand agreement in order to determine the allocation of proceeds to each of the multiple elements to be delivered 

the estimated selling price of miles calculated is generally consistent with the methodology as described above in miles earned in conjunction with flights  united calculates its estimated selling price for miles based on the rate at which we sell miles to our star alliance partners participating in reciprocal frequent flyer programs as the estimated selling price for miles management prospectively applied this change in estimate effective january 1 2012 the financial impact of this change in estimate in 2012 was substantially offset by the company’s change in estimate of its breakage for a portion of its miles which were previously not subject to an expiration policy ual accounts for miles sold and awarded that will never be redeemed by program members which we referred to as “breakage” using the redemption method ual reviews its breakage estimates annually based upon the latest available information regarding redemption and expiration patterns the revised estimates to breakage in 2012 increased the estimate of miles in the population that are expected to ultimately expire 

the company’s estimate of the expected expiration of miles requires significant management judgment current and future changes to expiration assumptions or to the expiration policy or to program rules and program redemption opportunities may result in material changes to the deferred revenue balance as well as recognized revenues from the programs 

the company records passenger revenue related to the air transportation element when the transportation is delivered the other elements are generally recognized as other operating revenue when earned 

the annual impact of adopting asu 200913 on operating revenue will decrease over time our ability to project the annual decline for each year is significantly impacted by credit card sales volumes frequent flyer redemption patterns and other factors 

the following table summarizes information related to ual’s and united’s frequent flyer deferred revenue liability 

 

 goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually as of october 1 or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired longlived assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever an indicator of impairment exists 

goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of continental’s assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the merger all goodwill and other purchase accounting adjustments have been pushed down to continental’s financial statements 

  

goodwill is measured for impairment by initially comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value a second step is performed to determine the implied fair value of goodwill if the implied fair value of goodwill is lower than its carrying value an impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded 

the company has one consolidated reporting unit in 2012 the company estimated the fair value of the consolidated reporting unit using both an income and a market approach the income approach computes fair value by discounting future cash flows of the business and is dependent on a number of critical management assumptions including estimates of future capacity passenger yield traffic operating costs including fuel prices appropriate discount rates and other relevant assumptions the market approach computes fair value by adding a control premium to the company’s market capitalization the company’s fair value exceeded its carrying value under both approaches and no goodwill impairment was recorded in 2012 

the company is also required to assess the goodwill recorded on the separate financial statements of continental for impairment the fair value of continental was determined by allocating a percentage of the fair value of the consolidated company as determined and described in the paragraph above the percentage of the consolidated fair value allocated to continental was based on a number of measures including revenue share available seat mile share revenue passenger mile share and passenger share based on these criteria this resulted in a fair value allocation of such assets to united and continental of 54 and 46 respectively the fair value of continental exceeded its carrying value and no goodwill impairment was recorded as of december 31 2012 

the company’s indefinitelived intangible assets include certain international route authorities takeoff and landing slots at various airports airline partner alliances and the ual trade name and logo the fair values of the assets for purposes of the annual impairment test were determined using the market and income approaches the fair value measurements were primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market we utilized the market approach to value certain intangible assets such as airport takeoff and landing slots when sufficient market information was available the income approach was primarily used to value the international route authorities airline partner alliances the ual trade name and logo and certain airport takeoff and landing slots the income approach indicates value for a subject asset based on the present value of cash flows projected to be generated by the asset projected cash flows are discounted at a required market rate of return that reflects the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money 

in most cases these indefinitelived assets are separately associated with and directly assignable to each separate subsidiary any impairment charges resulting from the testing of the fair values of these indefinitelived intangible assets are also assigned to the applicable separate subsidiary 

ual recorded impairment charges for indefinitelived intangible assets of 30 million 4 million and 29 million during the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively during 2012 and 2011 continental recorded impairment charges of 30 million and 4 million respectively on certain intangible assets related to european takeoff and landing slots to reflect the estimated fair value of these assets as part of its annual impairment test of indefinitelived intangible assets in 2010 ual recorded a 29 million impairment of its brazil routes primarily due to the open skies agreement between the united states and brazil which may result in a decrease in revenue from these routes 

longlived assets the net book value of operating property and equipment for ual was 173 billion and 164 billion at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively the assets’ recorded value is impacted by a number of accounting policy elections including the estimation of useful lives and residual values and when necessary the recognition of asset impairment charges 

the company records assets acquired including aircraft at acquisition cost depreciable life is determined through economic analysis such as reviewing existing fleet plans obtaining appraisals and comparing estimated lives to other airlines that operate similar fleets as aircraft technology has improved useful life has increased and the company has generally estimated the lives of those aircraft to be 30 years residual values are estimated based on historical experience with regard to the sale of both aircraft and spare parts and are established in 

  

conjunction with the estimated useful lives of the related fleets residual values are based on when the aircraft are acquired and typically reflect asset values that have not reached the end of their physical life both depreciable lives and residual values are revised periodically as facts and circumstances arise to recognize changes in the company’s fleet plan and other relevant information a oneyear increase in the average depreciable life of ual’s flight equipment would reduce annual depreciation expense on flight equipment by approximately 50 million 

the company evaluates the carrying value of longlived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist for purposes of this testing the company has generally identified the aircraft fleet type as the lowest level of identifiable cash flows for purposes of testing aircraft for impairment an impairment charge is recognized when the asset’s carrying value exceeds its net undiscounted future cash flows and its fair market value the amount of the charge is the difference between the asset’s carrying value and fair market value 

defined benefit plan accounting we sponsor defined benefit pension plans for eligible employees and retirees the most critical assumptions impacting our defined benefit pension plan obligations and expenses are the weighted average discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on the plan assets 

ual’s pension plans’ underfunded status was 24 billion at december 31 2012 nearly all of which is attributable to continental’s plans funding requirements for taxqualified defined benefit pension plans are determined by government regulations we estimate that our minimum funding requirements for the continental plans during 2012 is approximately 200 million the fair value of the plans’ assets was 22 billion at december 31 2012 of which 19 billion is attributed to assets of continental’s plans 

the following discussion relates only to the continental plans as the united plans are not material 

when calculating pension expense for 2013 continental assumed that its plans’ assets would generate a longterm rate of return of 775 the expected longterm rate of return assumption was developed based on historical experience and input from the trustee managing the plans’ assets   the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of assets which is based on a goal of earning the highest rate of return while maintaining risk at acceptable levels our projected longterm rate of return is slightly higher than some market indices due to the active management of our plans’ assets and is supported by the historical returns on our plans’ assets the plans strive to have assets sufficiently diversified so that adverse or unexpected results from one security class will not have an unduly detrimental impact on the entire portfolio we regularly review actual asset allocation and the pension plans’ investments are periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 

the defined benefit pension plans’ assets consist of return generating investments and risk mitigating investments which are held through direct ownership or through interests in common collective trusts return generating investments include primarily equity securities fixedincome securities and alternative investments eg private equity and hedge funds risk mitigating investments include primarily us government and investment grade corporate fixedincome securities the allocation of assets was as follows at december 31 2012 

 

 pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases lowering the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets by 50 basis points from 775 to 725 would increase estimated 2013 pension expense by approximately 10 million 

  

future pension obligations for the continental plans were discounted using a weighted average rate of 425 at december 31 2012 ual selected the 2012 discount rate for each of its plans by using a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds at december 31 2012 that would provide the necessary cash flows to match the projected benefit payments 

the pension liability and future pension expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points from 425 to 375 would increase the pension liability at december 31 2012 by approximately 457   million and increase the estimated 2013 pension expense by approximately 55 million 

future changes in plan asset returns plan provisions assumed discount rates pension funding law and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future 

actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions under the applicable accounting standards for defined benefit pension plans those gains and losses are not required to be recognized currently as pension benefit expense but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into expense over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees all gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are amortized to expense over the remaining years of service of the covered active employees at december 31 2012 and 2011 ual had unrecognized actuarial losses for pension benefit plans of 826 million and 231 million respectively recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 

other postretirement benefit plan accounting united’s postretirement plan provides certain health care benefits primarily in the us to retirees and eligible dependents as well as certain life insurance benefits to certain retirees reflected as “other benefits” continental’s retiree medical programs permit retirees who meet certain age and service requirements to continue medical coverage between retirement and medicare eligibility eligible employees are required to pay a portion of the costs of their retiree medical benefits which in some cases may be offset by accumulated unused sick time at the time of their retirement plan benefits are subject to copayments deductibles and other limits as described in the plans 

the company accounts for other postretirement benefits by recognizing the difference between plan assets and obligations or the plan’s funded status in its financial statements other postretirement benefit expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees’ approximate service periods and is generally calculated independently of funding decisions or requirements the company has not been required to prefund its plan obligations which has resulted in a significant net obligation as discussed below 

ual’s benefit obligation was 27 billion and 25 billion for the other postretirement benefit plans at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively the yearoveryear increase is due to changes in the assumptions used to value the obligation for ual’s plan such as the decrease in the discount rate 

the calculation of other postretirement benefit expense and obligations requires the use of a number of assumptions including the assumed discount rate for measuring future payment obligations and the health care cost trend rate ual determines the appropriate discount rate for each of its plans based on current rates on high quality corporate bonds that would generate the cash flow necessary to pay plan benefits when due united’s weighted average discount rate to determine its benefit obligations as of december 31 2012 was 413 as compared to 493 for december 31 2011 continental’s weighted average discount rate to determine its benefit obligations as of december 31 2012 was 397 as compared to 478 for december 31 2011 the health care cost trend rate assumed by united and continental for 2012 was 7 as compared to assumed trend rate for 2013 of 68 declining to 5 in 2020 a 1 increase in assumed health care trend rates would increase ual’s total service and interest cost for the year ended december 31 2012 by 22 million whereas a 1 decrease in assumed health care trend rates would decrease ual’s total service and interest cost for the year ended december 31 2012 by 18 million respectively a one percentage point decrease in the weighted average discount rate would increase ual’s postretirement benefit liability by approximately 336 million and increase the estimated 2012 benefits expense by approximately 23 million 

  

actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions under the applicable accounting standards for postretirement welfare benefit plans those gains and losses are not required to be recognized currently as other postretirement expense but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into expense over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees all gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are amortized to expense over the remaining years of service of the covered active employees at december 31 2012 and 2011 ual had unrecognized actuarial gainslosses for postretirement welfare benefit plans of 79 million and 33 million respectively recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 

income taxes 

the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income including the reversals of deferred tax liabilities during the periods in which those deferred tax assets will become deductible the company’s management assesses available positive and negative evidence regarding the realizability of its deferred tax assets and records a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized to form a conclusion management considers positive evidence in the form of reversing temporary differences projections of future taxable income and tax planning strategies and negative evidence such as recent history of losses although the company was no longer in a threeyear cumulative loss position at the end of 2012 management determined that the loss in 2012 the overall modest level of cumulative pretax income in the three years ended december 31 2012 of 04 of total revenues in that period and the uncertainty associated with projecting future taxable income supported the conclusion that the valuation allowance was still necessary on net deferred assets as a result of the loss sustained in 2012 and the need to complete final integration activities that produce synergies and overcome cost increases from new labor agreements management’s position is that sufficient positive evidence to support a reversal of the remaining valuation allowance does not exist and has retained a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets management will continue to evaluate future financial performance as well as the impacts of special charges on such performance to determine whether such performance provides sufficient evidence to support reversal of the valuation allowance

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend interest rates our net income loss is affected by fluctuations in interest rates eg interest expense on variablerate debt and interest income earned on shortterm investments the company’s policy is to manage interest rate risk through a combination of fixed and variable rate debt the following table summarizes information related to the company’s interest rate market risk at december 31 in millions 

 

 a change in market interest rates would also impact interest income earned on our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments assuming our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments remain at their average 2012 levels a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a corresponding increase in ual united and continental interest income of approximately 74 million 43 million and 31 million respectively during 2013 

  

commodity price risk aircraft fuel the availability and price of aircraft fuel significantly affects the company’s operations results of operations financial position and liquidity 

to protect against increases in the prices of aircraft fuel the company routinely hedges a portion of its future fuel requirements the company generally uses financial hedge instruments including fixed price swaps purchased call options and commonly used combinations using put and call options including collars sold put option combined with purchased call option and threeways sold put option combined with purchased call option and a higher strike sold call option these hedge instruments are generally based on aircraft fuel or closely related commodities including heating oil diesel fuel and crude oil 

some financial hedge contracts may result in losses if the underlying commodity prices drop below specified floor prices however the negative impact of these losses may be outweighed by the benefit of lower aircraft fuel cost since the company typically hedges only a portion of its future fuel requirements the company does not enter into hedge instruments for trading purposes 

if fuel prices decline significantly from the levels existing at the time we enter into a hedge contract we may be required to post collateral margin with our hedge counterparties the company frequently monitors this margin risk and assesses the potential of posting collateral with each of its counterparties at times when the fair market value of the company’s hedge contracts is net positive to the company it is exposed to the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to the hedge contract the company periodically monitors the credit worthiness of its counterparties and limits its exposure to any single counterparty 

the company may adjust its hedging program based on changes in market conditions the following table summarizes information related to the company’s cost of fuel and hedging in millions except percentages 

 

  

a includes related taxes and excludes hedging impacts and special charges in 2011 ual’s united’s and continental’s fuel cost was 37 37 and 36 of total operating expenses respectively 

b based on 2013 projected fuel consumption does not include the impact of fuel hedges 

c as of december 31 2011 the net fair value of ual’s united’s and continental’s fuel hedges was 73 million 44 million and 29 million respectively 

d based on fuel hedge positions at december 31 2012 

e assumes instantaneous change in prices and includes margin related to some hedge positions beyond december 31 2013 approximately 2 for 2014 

as of december 31 2012 the company had hedged approximately 31 and 2 of its projected fuel requirements 12 billion and 63 million gallons respectively for 2013 and 2014 respectively with commonly used financial hedge instruments based on aircraft fuel or closely related commodities such as heating oil diesel fuel and crude oil 

  

the fuel hedge portfolio is comprised of many individual hedge contracts primarily option contracts on multiple underlying commodities and entered into at various points in time resulting in a wide range of strike prices with several hedge counterparties the table below provides a view of the economic impact of the hedge portfolio on the company’s 2013 fuel costs given significant moves up to 20 in market fuel prices from december 31 2012 in millions 

 

  foreign currency the company generates revenues and incurs expenses in numerous foreign currencies changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the company’s results of operations through changes in the dollar value of foreign currencydenominated operating revenues and expenses some of the company’s more significant foreign currency exposures include the canadian dollar chinese renminbi european euro and japanese yen at times the company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency the company does not enter into derivative instruments for nonrisk management purposes 

the result of a uniform 10 percent strengthening in the value of the us dollar from december 31 2012 levels relative to each of the currencies in which the company has foreign currency exposure would result in a decrease in pretax income of approximately 291 million for the year ending december 31 2013 this sensitivity analysis was prepared based upon projected 2013 foreign currencydenominated revenues and expenses as of december 31 2012

 the company will incur substantial expenses in connection with the merger the company incurred approximately 450 million of integrationrelated cash costs in 2011 and expects to incur a similar amount in 2012 in categories generally consistent with 2011 there are many factors that could affect the total amount or the timing of those expenses and many of the expenses that will be incurred are by their nature difficult to estimate accurately see notes 1 and 21 to the financial statements included in item 8 of this report and item 1a risk factors for additional information on the merger 

operations 

network the company transports people and cargo through its mainline operations which utilize jet aircraft with at least 110 seats and its regional operations see item 2 properties for a description of the company’s mainline and regional aircraft 

with key global air rights in the us asiapacific europe middle east africa and latin america ual has the world’s most comprehensive global route network ual through united and continental and their regional carriers operates more than 5600 flights a day to more than 370 us domestic and international destinations from the company’s hubs at newark liberty international airport “newark liberty” chicago o’hare international airport “chicago o’hare” denver international airport “denver” george bush intercontinental airport “houston bush” hopkins international airport “cleveland hopkins” los angeles international airport “lax” ab won pat international airport “guam” san francisco international airport “sfo” and washington dulles international airport “washington dulles” including its regional operations united operates approximately 3200 flights a day to more than 235 us domestic and international destinations based on its annual flight schedule as of january 1 2012 including its regional operations continental operates approximately 2400 flights a day to more than 280 us domestic and international destinations based on its annual flight schedule as of january 1 2012 

  

all of the company’s domestic hubs are located in large business and population centers contributing to a large amount of “origin and destination” traffic our hub and spoke system allows us to transport passengers between a large number of destinations with substantially more frequent service than if each route were served directly our hub system also allows us to add service to a new destination from a large number of cities using only one or a limited number of aircraft as discussed under alliances below united is a member of star alliance the world’s largest airline network 

regional the company has contractual relationships with various regional carriers to provide regional jet and turboprop service branded as united express continental express and continental connection in the future the company’s regional operations will be branded as united express these regional operations are an extension of the company’s mainline network this regional service complements our operations by carrying traffic that connects to our mainline service and allows flights to smaller cities that cannot be provided economically with mainline jet aircraft chautauqua airlines colgan airlines “colgan” commutair airlines expressjet airlines gojet airlines mesa airlines shuttle america skywest airlines “skywest” and trans states airlines “trans states” are all regional carriers which operate most of their capacity under capacity purchase agreements with united andor continental under these capacity purchase agreements the company pays the regional carriers contractuallyagreed fees carriercontrolled costs for operating these flights plus a variable reimbursement incentive payment for superior operational performance based on agreed performance metrics the carriercontrolled costs are based on specific rates for various operating expenses of the regional carriers such as crew expenses maintenance and aircraft ownership some of which are multiplied by specific operating statistics eg block hours departures while others are fixed monthly amounts under these capacity purchase agreements the company is responsible for all fuel costs incurred as well as landing fees facilities rent and other costs which are passed through without any markup in return the regional carriers operate this capacity exclusively for united andor continental on schedules determined by the company the company also determines pricing and revenue management and assumes the inventory and distribution risk for the available seats 

while the regional carriers operating under capacity purchase agreements comprise more than 95 of all regional flights the company also has prorate agreements with hyannis air service inc “cape air” colgan gulfstream international airlines “gulfstream” skywest and trans states under these commercial flying agreements the company and its regional carriers agree to divide revenue collected from each passenger according to a formula while both the company and its regional carriers are individually responsible for their own costs of operations unlike capacity purchase agreements under a prorate agreement the regional carrier retains the control and risk of scheduling and in most cases market selection local seat pricing and inventory for its flights although the company and its regional carriers may coordinate schedules to maximize connections 

financial information on the company’s operating revenues by geographic regions as reported to the us department of transportation the “dot” can be found in note 10 to the financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

alliances united and continental have a number of bilateral and multilateral alliances with other airlines which enhance travel options for customers by providing greater time of day coverage to common destinations additional mileage accrual and redemption opportunities and access to markets that united and continental do not serve directly these marketing alliances typically include one or more of the following features loyalty program reciprocity codesharing of flight operations whereby seats on one carrier’s selected flights can be marketed under the brand name of another carrier coordination of reservations ticketing passenger checkin baggage handling and flight schedules and other resourcesharing activities 

united is a member of star alliance a global integrated airline network cofounded by united in 1997 and the most comprehensive airline alliance in the world as of january 1 2012 star alliance carriers served 1290 airports in 189 countries with over 21000 daily flights current star alliance members in addition to united and continental are adria airways aegean airlines air canada air china air new zealand all nippon airways 

  

asiana airlines austrian airlines blue1 bmi brussels airlines croatia airlines egyptair ethiopian airlines lot polish airlines lufthansa scandinavian airlines singapore airlines south african airways swiss international air lines tam tap portugal thai turkish airlines and us airways shenzhen airlines avianca taca “taca” and copa airlines “copa” have been announced as future star alliance members 

in 2010 united continental and air canada entered into a memorandum of understanding to establish a revenue sharing transborder joint venture a joint venture agreement was subsequently drafted based on the transatlantic joint venture agreement among united continental air canada and lufthansa while the parties already have us antitrust immunity the canadian competition bureau objected to the joint venture in june 2011 and the parties are currently involved in litigation before the canadian competition tribunal which may affect the implementation or the scope of the joint venture 

in 2010 pursuant to antitrust immunity approval granted by the dot united continental air canada and lufthansa entered into a joint venture agreement as full participants covering transatlantic routes between march 2011 and july 2011 austrian airlines bmi and swiss international air lines began participation in the joint venture as part of the lufthansa group in november 2011 the dot confirmed brussels airlines is covered as a lufthansa group affiliate within the existing antitrustimmunized alliance brussels airlines is expected to be integrated into the transatlantic joint venture during 2012 as a part of the lufthansa group lufthansa recently announced an agreement to sell bmi and upon conclusion of that sale bmi will no longer participate in the joint venture the european commission which has been conducting a standard review of the competitive effects of the joint venture has not yet completed its review the joint venture which enables the carriers to integrate the services they operate between the united states and europe and to capture revenue synergies delivers highly competitive flight schedules fares and service the joint venture has a revenuesharing structure that results in payments among full participants based on a formula that compares current period unit revenue performance on transatlantic routes to a historic period or “baseline” which is reset annually the payments are calculated on a quarterly basis and subject to a cap see industry regulation below 

in november 2010 united continental and all nippon airways received antitrust immunity approval from the japanese government and the dot enabling the carriers to establish a transpacific joint venture to integrate the services they operate between the united states and japan and other destinations in asia and to derive potentially significant benefits from coordinated scheduling pricing sales and inventory management the integration of services will also allow the carriers to offer passengers highly competitive flight schedules fares and services we expect to fully implement the joint venture in 2012 

during 2011 united and continental maintained independent marketing agreements with other air carriers including aeromar aer lingus avianca cape air colgan copa emirates eva air great lakes airlines gulfstream hawaiian airlines island air jet airways qatar airways skywest taca trans states and virgin atlantic airways in addition continental offers a traintoplane alliance with amtrak from newark liberty to select regional destinations 

fuel aircraft fuel has been the company’s single largest operating expense for the last several years the table below summarizes ual’s fuel cost data during the last three years 

 

  

    

the availability and price of aircraft fuel significantly affects the company’s operations results of operations and financial position to ensure adequate supplies of fuel and to obtain a measure of control over prices in the short term the company arranges to have fuel shipped on major pipelines and stored close to its major hub locations to protect against increases in the prices of fuel the company routinely hedges a portion of its future fuel requirements the company uses fixed price swaps purchased call options collars or other such commonly used financial hedge instruments based on aircraft fuel or closely related commodities including heating oil diesel fuel and crude oil the company strives to maintain fuel hedging levels and exposure such that the company’s fuel cost is not disproportionate to the fuel costs of its major competitors 

loyalty program united’s mileage plus and continental’s onepass “onepass” programs build customer loyalty by offering awards and services to program participants members in these programs earn mileage credit for flights on united united express continental continental express continental connection airlines in star alliance and certain other airlines that participate in the program miles can also be earned by purchasing the goods and services of our network of nonairline partners such as credit card issuers retail merchants hotels and car rental companies mileage credits can be redeemed for free discounted or upgraded travel and nontravel awards 

in 2011 the company announced that mileageplus will be the loyalty program for the company beginning in 2012 onepass is expected to end in the first quarter 2012 at which point united will automatically enroll onepass members in mileageplus and deposit into those mileageplus accounts award miles equal to their onepass award miles balance 

the company’s loyalty program has the consolidated amended and restated cobranded card marketing services agreement dated june 9 2011 the “cobrand agreement” with chase bank usa na “chase” under this agreement loyalty program members accrue frequent flyer miles for making purchases using cobranded credit cards issued by chase the cobrand agreement provides for joint marketing of the credit card programs and provides chase with other benefits such as permission to market to the company’s customer database 

in 2011 25 million mileage plus travel awards were used on united these awards represented 82 of united’s total revenue passenger miles in 2011 also in 2011 19 million onepass travel awards were used on continental these awards represented 56 of continental’s total revenue passenger miles in 2011 

in addition mileage plus members redeemed miles for approximately 13 million nonunited travel awards in 2011 as compared to 975000 in 2010 nonunited travel awards include united club memberships car and hotel awards merchandise and travel solely on another air carrier among others also in 2011 onepass members redeemed miles for approximately 489000 noncontinental travel awards as compared to 381000 in 2010 the increase in the number of nonunited and noncontinental travel awards redeemed in 2011 was due primarily to an increase in car and hotel redemptions total miles redeemed for travel on united and continental in 2011 including classofservice upgrades represented 83 of the total miles redeemed 

distribution channels the majority of the company’s airline seat inventory continues to be distributed through the traditional channels of travel agencies and global distribution systems “gds” the growing use of direct sales websites such as unitedcom and continentalcom and alternative distribution systems provides the company with an opportunity to decommoditize its services better control its content make more targeted offerings retain its customers enhance its brand and lower its ticket distribution costs to encourage customer use of lowercost channels and capitalize on these costsaving opportunities the company will continue to expand the capabilities of its websites and explore alternative distribution channels 

industry conditions 

domestic competition the domestic airline industry is highly competitive and dynamic new and existing us carriers are generally free to initiate service between any two points within the united states the company’s competitors consist primarily of other airlines and to a lesser extent other forms of transportation and 

  

technological substitutes such as videoconferencing competition can be direct in the form of another carrier flying the exact nonstop route or indirect where a carrier serves the same two cities nonstop from an alternative airport in that city or via an itinerary requiring a connection at another airport 

air carriers’ cost structures are not uniform among the numerous factors influencing a carrier’s cost structure are the carrier’s chosen businessservice model and any reorganization undertaken pursuant to chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code carriers with lower costs may deliver lower fares to passengers which could have a potential negative impact on the company’s revenues in addition future airline mergers or acquisitions may enable airlines to improve their revenue and cost performance relative to peers and thus enhance their competitive position within the industry 

decisions on domestic pricing are based on intense competitive pressure exerted on the company by other us airlines in order to remain competitive and to maintain passenger traffic levels we often find it necessary to match competitors’ discounted fares because we compete in a dynamic marketplace attempts to generate additional revenue through increased fares oftentimes fail 

international competition internationally the company competes not only with us airlines but also with foreign carriers international competition has increased and may increase in the future as a result of airline mergers and acquisitions joint ventures restructurings liberalization of aviation bilateral agreements and new or increased service by competitors competition on international routes is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation the company’s ability to compete successfully with nonus carriers on international routes depends in part on its ability to generate traffic to and from the entire united states via its integrated domestic route network and its ability to overcome business and operational challenges across its network worldwide foreign carriers currently are prohibited by us law from carrying local passengers between two points in the united states and the company experiences comparable restrictions in foreign countries in addition in the absence of open skies and fifth freedom rights us carriers are constrained from carrying passengers to points beyond designated international gateway cities due to limitations in air service agreements and restrictions imposed unilaterally by foreign governments to compensate partially for these structural limitations us and foreign carriers have entered into alliances and marketing arrangements that enable these carriers to exchange traffic between each other’s flights and route networks see alliances above for further information 

seasonality the air travel business is subject to seasonal fluctuations historically demand for air travel is higher in the second and third quarters driving higher revenues than in the first and fourth quarters which are periods of lower travel demand 

industry regulation 

domestic regulation 

general all carriers engaged in air transportation in the united states are subject to regulation by the dot absent an exemption no air carrier may provide air transportation of passengers or property without first being issued a dot certificate of public convenience and necessity the dot also grants international route authority approves international codeshare arrangements and regulates methods of competition in recent years the dot has proposed and implemented a variety of farreaching and expensive consumer protection regulations dealing with advertising denied boarding compensation tarmac delays and baggage liability 

airlines are also regulated by the faa an agency within the dot primarily in the areas of flight safety air carrier operations and aircraft maintenance and airworthiness the faa issues air carrier operating certificates and aircraft airworthiness certificates prescribes maintenance procedures oversees airport operations and regulates pilot and other employee training from time to time the faa issues directives that require air carriers to inspect or modify aircraft and other equipment potentially causing the company to incur substantial unplanned expenses the airline industry is also subject to various other federal laws and regulations the us 

  

department of homeland security “dhs” has jurisdiction over virtually every aspect of civil aviation security see legislation  below the antitrust division of the us department of justice “doj” has jurisdiction over certain airline competition matters the us postal service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail labor relations in the airline industry are generally governed by the railway labor act “rla” the company is also subject to investigation inquiries by the dot faa doj and other us and international regulatory bodies 

airport access access to landing and takeoff rights or “slots” at several major us airports and many foreign airports served by the company are or recently have been subject to government regulation federally mandated domestic slot restrictions currently apply at reagan national airport in washington dc “washington reagan” john f kennedy international airport “jfk” laguardia airport “laguardia” and newark liberty in addition to address concerns about airport congestion the faa has designated certain airports including newark liberty jfk and laguardia as “high density traffic airports” and has imposed operating restrictions at these three airports which may include capacity reductions additional restrictions on airline routes and takeoff and landing slots may be proposed in the future that could affect the company’s rights of ownership and transfer 

legislation the airline industry is subject to legislative activity that may have an impact on operations and costs in addition to significant federal state and local taxes and fees that the company is currently subject to proposed taxes and fees are currently pending that may increase the company’s operating costs if imposed on the company congress is currently attempting to pass comprehensive reauthorization legislation to impose a new funding structure and make other changes to faa operations past aviation reauthorization bills have affected a wide range of areas of interest to the industry including air traffic control operations capacity control airline competition aircraft and airport technology requirements safety and taxes fees and other funding sources congress may also pass other legislation that could increase labor and operating costs climate change legislation is also likely to be a significant area of legislative and regulatory focus and could adversely impact the company’s costs see environmental regulation  below 

in december 2009 the dot issued a final rule intended to enhance airline passenger protections the final rule included regulations requiring certain air carriers including united and continental to adopt detailed contingency plans applicable to tarmac delays exceeding three hours for domestic flights and four hours for international flights subject to exceptions for safety and security a carrier’s failure to meet certain service performance criteria under the rule could subject it to substantial civil penalties in april 2011 the dot issued a second set of consumer protection regulations in the form of a final rule this second initiative mandated the amount of compensation carriers must provide passengers when they are denied boarding imposed regulations requiring carriers to charge the same baggage fee throughout a passenger’s entire journey even if on multiple carriers and expanded the tarmac delay rule to foreign carriers operating to and from the united states additionally since september 11 2001 aviation security has been and continues to be a subject of frequent legislative and regulatory action requiring changes to the company’s security processes and frequently increasing the cost of its security procedures 

in december 2011 the faa issued a final rule amending the existing flight duty and rest regulations applicable to us air carriers operating under part 121 of the federal aviation regulations the provisions under the 2011 final rule may require us to make changes to our flight operations that could materially increase our costs 

international regulation 

general international air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation in connection with the company’s international services the company is regulated by both the us government and the governments of the foreign countries the company serves in addition the availability of international routes to us carriers is regulated by aviation agreements between the us and foreign governments and in some cases fares and schedules require the approval of the dot andor the relevant foreign governments 

  

airport access historically access to foreign markets has been tightly controlled through bilateral agreements between the us and each foreign country involved these agreements regulate the markets served the number of carriers allowed to serve each market and the frequency of carriers’ flights since the early 1990s the us has pursued a policy of “open skies” meaning all usflag carriers have access to the destination under which the us government has negotiated a number of bilateral agreements allowing unrestricted access between us and foreign markets currently there are more than 100 open skies agreements in effect however many of the airports that united and continental serve in europe asia and latin america maintain slot controls a large number of these are restrictive due to congestion at these airports london heathrow international airport “london heathrow” frankfurt rheinmain airport shanghai pudong international airport beijing capital international airport sao paulo guarhulos international airport tokyo narita international airport and haneda international airport are among the most restrictive foreign airports due to capacity limitations 

the company’s ability to serve some foreign markets and expand into certain others is limited by the absence of aviation agreements between the us government and the relevant foreign governments shifts in us or foreign government aviation policies may lead to the alteration or termination of air service agreements depending on the nature of any such change the value of the company’s international route authorities and slot rights may be materially enhanced or diminished 

the useu open skies agreement provides us and eu carriers with expansive rights including the right to operate between any point in the united states and the eu the agreement has no direct impact on airport slot rights or airport facilities nor does it provide for a reallocation of existing slots or facilities including those at london heathrow because of the diverse nature of potential impacts on the company’s business the overall future impact of the useu agreement on the company’s business cannot be predicted with certainty 

in october 2010 the open skies agreement between the united states and japan became effective enabling us or japanese carriers to fly between any point in the united states and any point in japan and in the case of us carriers beyond japan to points in other countries the carrier is authorized to serve the agreement eliminates the restrictions on the number of frequencies carriers can operate and requires governments in both the united states and japan to concur before taking action to regulate a carrier’s fares or rates however under the terms of the bilateral agreement certain points in japan remain slot restricted and only four slot pairs at tokyo haneda international airport are available to us air carriers at this time none of which is held by united and continental 

environmental regulation 

general the airline industry is subject to increasingly stringent federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations concerning emissions to the air discharges to surface and subsurface waters safe drinking water aircraft noise and the management of hazardous substances oils and waste materials areas of either proposed regulations or implementation of new regulations include regulations surrounding the emission of greenhouse gases discussed further below state of california regulations regarding air emissions from ground support equipment a federal rulemaking concerning the discharge of deicing fluid and a federal rulemaking seeking to regulate airport fuel hydrant systems 

climate change there are certain laws and regulations relating to climate change that apply to the company including the eu emissions trading scheme “ets” which is subject to international dispute environmental taxes for certain international flights including the united kingdom’s air passenger duty and germany’s departure ticket tax limited greenhouse gas reporting requirements and the state of california’s cap and trade regulations which impacts united’s san francisco maintenance center in addition there are landbased planning laws that could apply to airport expansion projects requiring a review of greenhouse gas emissions and could affect airlines in certain circumstances 

in 2009 the eu issued a directive to member states to include aviation in its greenhouse gas ets in december 2009 the air transportation association joined by united continental and american airlines filed a lawsuit in 

  

the united kingdom challenging regulations that transpose into uk law the eu ets as applied to us carriers the united kingdom being the specific “implementing country” designated to implement the eu ets requirements as they apply to these carriers the case was referred to the court of justice of the european union “cjeu” and on december 21 2011 the cjeu issued an opinion that upheld the eu ets more than forty noneu countries have gone on record opposing the scheme and based upon this significant international dispute it is unclear whether or not the inclusion of aviation in the eu ets will be sustained if the scheme continues it will increase the cost of carriers operating in the eu by requiring the purchase of carbon credits although the precise cost to the company is difficult to calculate with certainty due to a number of variables including the company’s future carbon emissions with respect to flights to and from the eu and the price of carbon credits management continues to evaluate what the impact would be for the company in 2012 

while the eu ets is being disputed the company has met and continues to meet its compliance obligations under the scheme including implementation in 2010 of detailed requirements for monitoring and reporting of emissions of carbon dioxide as of january 1 2012 the eu ets required the company to ensure that by each compliance date it has obtained sufficient emission allowances equal to the amount of carbon dioxide emissions with respect to flights to and from eu member states in the preceding calendar year such allowances are to be surrendered on an annual basis to the relevant government with an initial compliance date of april 30 2013 for emissions subject to the eu ets in 2012 for 2012 the company estimates it will receive from the united kingdom allowances equal to approximately 80 of the company’s carbon emissions relative to the 2010 base year leaving a remaining amount that will need to be purchased by the company the amount of such allowances provided by the united kingdom is expected to decrease in future years potentially leaving a greater amount of allowances that may be required to be purchased additionally any increase in the amount of such carbon emissions would require the purchase of additional carbon allowances by the company 

the international civil aviation organization “icao” is in the process of developing a regulatory program for international aviation greenhouse gas emissions with the intent to reach international agreement that the icao program would replace regional schemes such as the eu ets without an international agreement there could be other regulatory actions taken in the future by the us government state governments within the us or foreign governments to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry which could result in multiple schemes applying to the same emissions the precise nature of any such requirements and their applicability to the company are difficult to predict but the financial impact to the company and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant including the potential for increased fuel costs carbon taxes or fees or a requirement to purchase carbon credits 

the company is taking various actions to reduce its carbon emissions through fleet renewal aircraft retrofits and actions that are establishing the foundation for the commercialization of aviation biofuels 

other environmental matters some us and foreign airports have established airport restrictions to limit noise including restrictions on aircraft types to be used and limits on the number and scheduling of hourly or daily operations in some instances these restrictions have caused curtailments in services or increased operating costs and could limit our ability to expand our operations at the affected airports 

the airline industry is also subject to other environmental laws and regulations that require the company to remediate soil or groundwater to meet certain objectives and which may require significant expenditures under the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as “superfund” and similar environmental cleanup laws generators of waste materials and owners or operators of facilities can be subject to liability for investigation and remediation costs at locations that have been identified as requiring response actions the company also conducts voluntary environmental assessment and remediation actions environmental cleanup obligations can arise from among other circumstances the operation of aircraft fueling facilities and primarily involve airport sites future costs associated with these activities are currently not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

  

employees 

as of december 31 2011 ual including its subsidiaries had approximately 87000 active employees as of december 31 2011 united had approximately 47000 active employees and continental had approximately 40000 active employees approximately 72 of the combined company’s employees were represented by various us labor organizations as of december 31 2011 

collective bargaining agreements between the company and its represented employee groups are negotiated under the rla which governs labor relations in the air transportation industry such agreements typically do not contain an expiration date and instead specify an amendable date upon which the contract is considered “open for amendment” the process for integrating the represented employee groups of united and continental is governed by a combination of the rla the mccaskillbond amendment and where applicable the existing provisions of united’s and continental’s collective bargaining agreements and union policies under the rla the national mediation board “nmb” has exclusive authority to resolve union representation disputes arising out of airline mergers under the mccaskillbond amendment “fair and equitable” integration of seniority lists is required including arbitration where the interested parties cannot reach a consensual agreement consistent with the process set forth in the alleghenymohawk labor protective provisions or internal union merger policies if applicable pending operational integration the company will apply the terms of the existing collective bargaining agreements unless other terms have been negotiated 

the following table reflects the company’s represented employee groups number of employees per represented group union for each of united’s and continental’s employee groups where applicable amendable date for each employee group’s collective bargaining agreement and whether the group is engaged in negotiations for a joint collective bargaining agreement 

 

   

 the company cannot predict the outcome of negotiations with its unionized employee groups although significant increases in the pay and benefits resulting from new collective bargaining agreements could have an adverse financial impact on the company 

 

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend the following risk factors should be read carefully when evaluating the company’s business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this report and other statements the company or its representatives make from time to time any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect the company’s business operating results financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this report 

the merger may present certain material risks to the company’s business and operations 

the merger described in item 1 business may present certain risks to the company’s business and operations including among other things risks that 

 

  

  

  

   

  

  

 accordingly there can be no assurance that the merger will result in the realization of the full benefits of synergies innovation and operational efficiencies that we currently expect that these benefits will be achieved within the anticipated timeframe or that we will be able to fully and accurately measure any such synergies 

continued periods of historically high fuel costs or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a material adverse impact on the company’s operating results financial position and liquidity 

aircraft fuel has been the company’s single largest operating expense for the last several years the availability and price of aircraft fuel significantly affects the company’s operations results of operations financial position and liquidity while the company arranges to have fuel shipped on major pipelines and stored close to its major hub locations to ensure supply continuity in the short term the company cannot predict the continued future availability of aircraft fuel 

at times due to the highly competitive nature of the airline industry the company has not been able to increase its fares or other fees sufficiently to offset increased fuel costs continued volatility in fuel prices may negatively impact the company’s liquidity in the future the company may not be able to increase its fares or other fees if fuel prices rise in the future and any such fare or fee increases may not be sustainable in the highly competitive airline industry in addition any increases in fares or other fees may not sufficiently offset the fuel price increase and may reduce the demand for air travel 

the company enters into hedging arrangements to protect against rising fuel costs however the company’s hedging programs may use significant amounts of cash due to posting of cash collateral in some circumstances may not be successful in controlling fuel costs and may be limited due to market conditions and other factors in addition significant declines in fuel prices may increase the costs associated with the company’s fuel hedging arrangements to the extent it has entered into swaps or collars swaps and sold put options as part of a collar may obligate us to make payments to the counterparty upon settlement of the contracts if the price of the commodity hedged falls below the agreed upon amount declining crude and related prices may result in the company posting significant amounts of collateral to cover potential amounts owed beyond certain creditbased thresholds with respect to swap and collar contracts that have not yet settled also lower fuel prices may result in increased industry capacity and lower fares especially to the extent that reduced fuel costs justify increased utilization by airlines of less fuel efficient aircraft 

there can be no assurance that the company’s hedging arrangements will provide any particular level of protection against increases or declines in fuel costs or that its counterparties will be able to perform under the company’s hedging arrangements additionally deterioration in the company’s financial condition could negatively affect its ability to enter into new hedge contracts in the future and may potentially require the company to post increased amounts of collateral under its fuel hedging agreements 

see note 13 to the financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information on the company’s hedging programs 

economic and industry conditions constantly change and unfavorable global economic conditions may have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations 

the company’s business and results of operations are significantly impacted by general economic and industry conditions the airline industry is highly cyclical and the level of demand for air travel is correlated to the 

  

strength of the us and global economies robust demand for our air transportation services depends largely on favorable economic conditions including the strength of the domestic and foreign economies low unemployment levels strong consumer confidence levels and the availability of consumer and business credit 

air transportation is often a discretionary purchase that leisure travelers may limit or eliminate during difficult economic times in addition during periods of unfavorable economic conditions business travelers usually reduce the volume of their travel either due to costsaving initiatives or as a result of decreased business activity requiring travel during the global recession in 2008 and 2009 the company’s business and results of operations were adversely affected due to significant declines in industry passenger demand particularly with respect to the company’s business and premium cabin travelers and a reduction in fare levels in addition to its effect on demand for the company’s services the recession severely disrupted the global capital markets resulting in a diminished availability of financing and a higher cost for financing that was obtainable 

while some economic indicators that may reflect an economic recovery have exhibited growth other economic indicators such as unemployment may not improve materially for an extended period of time stagnant or worsening global economic conditions either in the united states or in other geographic regions and continued volatility in us and global financial and credit markets may have a material adverse effect on the company’s revenues results of operations and liquidity if such economic conditions were to disrupt capital markets in the future the company may be unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all to refinance certain maturing debt and to satisfy future capital commitments 

the company is subject to economic and political instability and other risks of doing business globally 

the company is a global business with operations outside of the united states from which it derives approximately onethird of its operating revenues as measured and reported to the dot the company’s operations in asia europe latin america africa and the middle east are a vital part of its worldwide airline network volatile economic political and market conditions in these international regions may have a negative impact on the company’s operating results and its ability to achieve its business objectives in addition significant or volatile changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies and the imposition of exchange controls or other currency restrictions may have a material adverse impact upon the company’s liquidity revenues costs and operating results 

the company may not be able to maintain adequate liquidity 

the company has a significant amount of financial leverage from fixed obligations including aircraft lease and debt financings leases of airport property and other facilities and other material cash obligations in addition the company has substantial noncancelable commitments for capital expenditures including the acquisition of new aircraft and related spare engines 

although the company’s cash flows from operations and its available capital including the proceeds from financing transactions have been sufficient to meet these obligations and commitments to date the company’s future liquidity could be negatively impacted by the risk factors discussed in this item 1a including but not limited to substantial volatility in the price of fuel adverse economic conditions disruptions in the global capital markets and catastrophic external events 

if the company’s liquidity is constrained due to the various risk factors noted in this item 1a or otherwise the company’s failure to comply with certain financial covenants under its financing and credit card processing agreements timely pay its debts or comply with other material provisions of its contractual obligations could result in a variety of adverse consequences including the acceleration of the company’s indebtedness increase of required reserves under credit card processing agreements the withholding of credit card sale proceeds by its credit card service providers and the exercise of other remedies by its creditors and equipment lessors that could result in material adverse effects on the company’s financial position and results of operations furthermore 

  

constrained liquidity may limit the company’s ability to withstand competitive pressures and limit its flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions including increased competition and demand for new services placing the company at a disadvantage when compared to its competitors that have less debt and making the company more vulnerable than its competitors who have less debt to a downturn in the business industry or the economy in general 

the company’s substantial level of indebtedness and noninvestment grade credit rating as well as market conditions and the availability of assets as collateral for loans or other indebtedness may make it difficult to raise additional capital to meet its liquidity needs on acceptable terms or at all 

see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further information regarding the company’s liquidity 

certain of the company’s financing agreements have covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on the company and its subsidiaries 

certain of the company’s credit facilities and indentures governing its secured notes impose certain operating and financial covenants on the company on united and its material subsidiaries or on continental and its subsidiaries such covenants require the company united or continental as applicable to maintain depending on the particular agreement minimum fixed charge coverage ratios minimum liquidity andor minimum collateral coverage ratios a decline in the value of collateral could result in a situation where the company united or continental as applicable may not be able to maintain the required collateral coverage ratio in addition the credit facilities and indentures contain other negative covenants customary for such financings 

the company’s ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond its control including the overall industry revenue environment and the level of fuel costs and the company may be required to seek waivers or amendments of covenants repay all or a portion of the debt or find alternative sources of financing the company cannot provide assurance that such waivers amendments or alternative financing could be obtained or if obtained would be on terms acceptable to the company if the company fails to comply with these covenants and is unable to obtain a waiver or amendment an event of default would result which would allow the lenders among other things to declare outstanding amounts due and payable the company cannot provide assurance that it would have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance such amounts if they were to become due in addition an event of default or declaration of acceleration under any of the credit facilities or indentures could also result in an event of default under certain of the company’s other financing agreements due to crossdefault and crossacceleration provisions 

extensive government regulation could increase the company’s operating costs and restrict its ability to conduct its business 

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal oversight compliance with us and international regulations imposes significant costs and may have adverse effects on the company laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges both domestically and internationally have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce airline revenue the company cannot provide any assurance that current laws and regulations or laws or regulations enacted in the future will not adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations 

each of united and continental provides air transportation under certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by the dot if the dot altered amended modified suspended or revoked these certificates it could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business the dot is also responsible for promulgating consumer protection and other regulations that may impose significant compliance costs on the company the faa regulates the safety of united’s and continental’s operations united and continental operate pursuant to a single air carrier operating certificate issued by the faa from time to time the faa also issues orders airworthiness 

  

directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require material expenditures or operational restrictions by the company these faa orders and directives could include the temporary grounding of an entire aircraft type if the faa identifies design manufacturing maintenance or other issues requiring immediate corrective action faa requirements cover among other things retirement of older aircraft security measures collision avoidance systems airborne windshear avoidance systems noise abatement and other environmental concerns aircraft operation and safety and increased inspections and maintenance procedures to be conducted on older aircraft these faa directives or requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company 

in addition the company’s operations may be adversely impacted due to the existing antiquated air traffic control “atc” system utilized by the us government during peak travel periods in certain markets the current atc system’s inability to handle existing travel demand has led to shortterm capacity constraints imposed by government agencies and resulted in delays and disruptions of air traffic in addition the current system will not be able to effectively handle projected future air traffic growth imposition of these atc constraints on a longterm basis may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations failure to update the atc system in a timely manner and the substantial funding requirements of a modernized atc system that may be imposed on air carriers may have an adverse impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

the airline industry is subject to extensive federal state and local taxes and fees that increase the cost of the company’s operations in addition to taxes and fees that the company is currently subject to proposed taxes and fees are currently pending and if imposed would increase the company’s operating expenses 

access to landing and takeoff rights or “slots” at several major us airports and many foreign airports served by the company are or recently have been subject to government regulation certain of the company’s major hubs are among increasingly congested airports in the united states and have been or could be the subject of regulatory action that might limit the number of flights andor increase costs of operations at certain times or throughout the day the faa may limit the company’s airport access by limiting the number of departure and arrival slots at high density traffic airports which could affect the company’s ownership and transfer rights and local airport authorities may have the ability to control access to certain facilities or the cost of access to its facilities which could have an adverse effect on the company’s business in addition in 2008 the faa planned to withdraw and auction a certain number of slots held by airlines at the three primary new york area airports which the airlines challenged and the faa terminated in 2009 if the faa were to plan another auction that survived legal challenge by the airlines the company could incur substantial costs to obtain such slots further the company’s operating costs at airports at which it operates including the company’s major hubs may increase significantly because of capital improvements at such airports that the company may be required to fund directly or indirectly in some circumstances such costs could be imposed by the relevant airport authority without the company’s approval and may have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition 

the ability of us carriers to operate international routes is subject to change because the applicable arrangements between the united states and foreign governments may be amended from time to time or because appropriate slots or facilities may not be made available the company currently operates on a number of international routes under government arrangements that limit the number of carriers permitted to operate on the route the capacity of the carriers providing services on the route or the number of carriers allowed access to particular airports if an open skies policy were to be adopted for any of these routes such an event could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial position and results of operations and could result in the impairment of material amounts of related tangible and intangible assets in addition competition from revenuesharing joint ventures and other alliance arrangements by and among other airlines could impair the value of the company’s business and assets on the open skies routes 

the company’s plans to enter into or expand us antitrust immunized alliances and joint ventures on various international routes are subject to receipt of approvals from applicable us federal authorities and obtaining 

  

other applicable foreign government clearances or satisfying the necessary applicable regulatory requirements there can be no assurance that such approvals and clearances will be granted or continued in effect upon further regulatory review or that changes in regulatory requirements or standards can be satisfied 

many aspects of the company’s operations are also subject to increasingly stringent federal state local and international laws protecting the environment future environmental regulatory developments such as climate change regulations in the united states and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in the airline industry there are certain climate change laws and regulations that have already gone into effect and that apply to the company including the european union emissions trading scheme subject to international dispute the state of california’s cap and trade regulations environmental taxes for certain international flights limited greenhouse gas reporting requirements and landuse planning laws which could apply to airports and could affect airlines in certain circumstances in addition there is the potential for additional regulatory actions in regard to the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry the precise nature of future requirements and their applicability to the company are difficult to predict but the financial impact to the company and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant 

see item 1 business—industry regulation  above for further information on government regulation impacting the company 

the company relies heavily on technology and automated systems to operate its business and any significant failure or disruption of the technology or these systems could materially harm its business 

the company depends on automated systems and technology to operate its business including computerized airline reservation systems flight operations systems telecommunication systems and commercial websites including wwwunitedcom and wwwcontinentalcom united’s and continental’s websites and other automated systems must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic and deliver important flight and schedule information as well as process critical financial transactions these systems could suffer substantial or repeated disruptions due to events beyond the company’s control including natural disasters power failures terrorist attacks equipment or software failures computer viruses or cyber security attacks substantial or repeated website reservations systems or telecommunication systems failures or disruptions including failures or disruptions related to the company’s integration of technology systems could reduce the attractiveness of the company’s services versus its competitors materially impair its ability to market its services and operate its flights result in the unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and result in increased costs lost revenue and the loss or compromise of important data 

the company’s business relies extensively on thirdparty service providers failure of these parties to perform as expected or interruptions in the company’s relationships with these providers or their provision of services to the company could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the company has engaged an increasing number of thirdparty service providers to perform a large number of functions that are integral to its business including regional operations operation of customer service call centers distribution and sale of airline seat inventory provision of information technology infrastructure and services provision of aircraft maintenance and repairs provision of various utilities and performance of aircraft fueling operations among other vital functions and services the company does not directly control these thirdparty service providers although it does enter into agreements with many of them that define expected service performance any of these thirdparty service providers however may materially fail to meet their service performance commitments to the company or agreements with such providers may be terminated for example flight reservations booked by customers and travel agencies via thirdparty gdss may be adversely affected by disruptions in the business relationships between the company and gds operators such disruptions including a failure to agree upon acceptable contract terms when contracts expire or otherwise become subject to renegotiation may cause the carriers’ flight information to be limited or unavailable for display significantly increase fees for both the company and gds users and impair the company’s relationships with its customers 

  

and travel agencies the failure of any of the company’s thirdparty service providers to adequately perform their service obligations or other interruptions of services may reduce the company’s revenues and increase its expenses or prevent the company from operating its flights and providing other services to its customers in addition the company’s business and financial performance could be materially harmed if its customers believe that its services are unreliable or unsatisfactory 

ual’s obligations for funding continental’s defined benefit pension plans are affected by factors beyond ual’s control 

continental has defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its us employees other than the employees of its chelsea food services division and continental micronesia inc the timing and amount of ual’s funding requirements under continental’s plans depend upon a number of factors including labor negotiations with the applicable employee groups and changes to pension plan benefits as well as factors outside of ual’s control such as the number of applicable retiring employees asset returns interest rates and changes in pension laws changes to these and other factors that can significantly increase ual’s funding requirements such as its liquidity requirements could have a material adverse effect on ual’s financial condition 

union disputes employee strikes or slowdowns and other laborrelated disruptions as well as the integration of the united and continental workforces in connection with the merger present the potential for a delay in achieving expected merger synergies or increased labor costs that could adversely affect the company’s operations and impair its financial performance 

united and continental are both highly unionized companies as of december 31 2011 the company and its subsidiaries had approximately 87000 active employees of whom approximately 72 were represented by various us labor organizations 

the successful integration of united and continental and achievement of the anticipated benefits of the combined company depend in part on integrating united and continental employee groups and maintaining productive employee relations in order to fully integrate the premerger represented employee groups the company must negotiate a joint collective bargaining agreement covering each combined group the process for integrating the labor groups of united and continental is governed by a combination of the rla the mccaskillbond amendment and where applicable the existing provisions of each company’s collective bargaining agreements and union policy a delay in or failure to integrate the united and continental employee groups presents the potential for delays in achieving expected merger synergies increased labor costs and labor disputes that could adversely affect our operations 

the company can provide no assurance that a successful or timely resolution of labor negotiations for all amendable collective bargaining agreements will be achieved there is a risk that unions or individual employees might pursue judicial or arbitral claims arising out of changes implemented as a result of the merger employee dissatisfaction with the results of the seniority integration may lead to litigation that in some cases can delay implementation of the integrated seniority list there is also a possibility that employees or unions could engage in job actions such as slowdowns worktorule campaigns sickouts or other actions designed to disrupt united’s and continental’s normal operations in an attempt to pressure the companies in collective bargaining negotiations although the rla makes such actions unlawful until the parties have been lawfully released to selfhelp and united and continental can seek injunctive relief against premature selfhelp such actions can cause significant harm even if ultimately enjoined 

the airline industry is highly competitive and susceptible to price discounting and changes in capacity which could have a material adverse effect on the company 

the us airline industry is characterized by substantial price competition in recent years the market share held by lowcost carriers has increased significantly and is expected to continue to increase the increased market 

  

presence of lowcost carriers which engage in substantial price discounting has diminished the ability of large network carriers to achieve sustained profitability in domestic markets 

airlines also compete for market share by increasing or decreasing their capacity including route systems and the number of markets served several of the company’s domestic competitors have increased their international capacity by including service to some destinations that the company currently serves causing overlap in destinations served and therefore increasing competition for those destinations in addition the company and certain of its competitors have implemented significant capacity reductions in recent years in response to the global recession further certain of the company’s competitors may not reduce capacity or may increase capacity thereby diminishing the expected benefit to the company from capacity reductions this increased competition in both domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

the airline industry may undergo further bankruptcy restructuring industry consolidation or the creation or modification of alliances or joint ventures any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company 

the company faces and may to continue to face strong competition from other carriers due to bankruptcy restructuring industry consolidation and the creation and modification of alliances and joint ventures a number of carriers have filed for bankruptcy protection in recent years and other domestic and international carriers could restructure in bankruptcy or threaten to do so in the future to reduce their costs most recently amr corporation the parent company of american airlines filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in november 2011 carriers operating under bankruptcy protection can operate in a manner that could be adverse to the company and could emerge from bankruptcy as more vigorous competitors 

both the us and international airline industries have experienced consolidation through a number of mergers and acquisitions the company is also facing stronger competition from expanded airline alliances and joint ventures carriers entering into and participating in airline alliances slot swaps andor joint ventures may also become strong competitors as they are able to coordinate routes pool revenues and costs and enjoy other mutual benefits achieving many of the benefits of consolidation “open skies” agreements including the agreements between the united states and the eu and between the united states and japan may also give rise to additional consolidation or better integration opportunities among international carriers 

there is ongoing speculation that further airline industry consolidations or reorganizations could occur in the future the company routinely engages in analysis and discussions regarding its own strategic position including alliances asset acquisitions and divestitures and may have future discussions with other airlines regarding strategic activities if other airlines participate in such activities those airlines may significantly improve their cost structures or revenue generation capabilities thereby potentially making them stronger competitors of the company and potentially impairing the company’s ability to realize expected benefits from its own strategic relationships 

increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage may materially and adversely impact the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

following the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 the company’s insurance costs increased significantly and the availability of thirdparty war risk terrorism insurance decreased significantly the company has obtained thirdparty war risk terrorism insurance through a special program administered by the faa should the government discontinue this coverage obtaining comparable coverage from commercial underwriters could result in substantially higher premiums and more restrictive terms if such coverage is available at all if the company is unable to obtain adequate thirdparty war risk terrorism insurance its business could be materially and adversely affected 

if any of the company’s aircraft were to be involved in an accident or if the company’s property or operations were to be affected by a significant natural catastrophe or other event the company could be exposed to 

  

significant liability or loss if the company is unable to obtain sufficient insurance including aviation hull and liability insurance and property and business interruption coverage to cover such liabilities or losses whether due to insurance market conditions or otherwise its results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

the company could experience adverse publicity harm to its brand reduced travel demand and potential tort liability as a result of an accident or other catastrophe involving its aircraft the aircraft of its regional carriers or the aircraft of its codeshare partners which may result in a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial position 

an accident or catastrophe involving an aircraft that the company operates or an aircraft that is operated by a codeshare partner or one of the company’s regional carriers could have a material adverse effect on the company if such accident created a public perception that the company’s operations or the operations of its codeshare partners or regional carriers are less safe or reliable than other airlines such public perception could in turn cause harm to the company’s brand and reduce travel demand on the company’s flights or the flights of its codeshare partners or regional carriers 

in addition any such accident could expose the company to significant tort liability although the company currently maintains liability insurance in amounts and of the type the company believes to be consistent with industry practice to cover damages arising from any such accident and the company’s codeshare partners and regional carriers carry similar insurance and generally indemnify the company for their operations if the company’s liability exceeds the applicable policy limits or the ability of another carrier to indemnify it the company could incur substantial losses from an accident which may result in a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial position 

the company’s results of operations fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors associated with the airline industry 

due to greater demand for air travel during the spring and summer months revenues in the airline industry in the second and third quarters of the year are generally stronger than revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year which are periods of lower travel demand the company’s results of operations generally reflect this seasonality but have also been impacted by numerous other factors that are not necessarily seasonal including among others the imposition of excise and similar taxes extreme or severe weather air traffic control congestion geological events natural disasters changes in the competitive environment due to industry consolidation and other factors and general economic conditions as a result the company’s quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year and historical operating results in a quarterly or annual period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 

terrorist attacks or international hostilities or the fear of terrorist attacks or hostilities even if not made directly on the airline industry could negatively affect the company and the airline industry 

the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 involving commercial aircraft severely and adversely impacted each of united’s and continental’s financial condition and results of operations as well as the prospects for the airline industry among the effects experienced from the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks were substantial flight disruption costs caused by the faaimposed temporary grounding of the us airline industry’s fleet significantly increased security costs and associated passenger inconvenience increased insurance costs substantially higher ticket refunds and significantly decreased traffic and passenger revenue 

additional terrorist attacks even if not made directly on the airline industry or the fear of or the precautions taken in anticipation of such attacks including elevated national threat warnings or selective cancellation or redirection of flights could materially and adversely affect the company and the airline industry wars and other international hostilities could also have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition liquidity 

  

and results of operations the company’s financial resources may not be sufficient to absorb the adverse effects of any future terrorist attacks or other international hostilities 

an outbreak of a disease or similar public health threat could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business financial position and results of operations 

an outbreak of a disease that affects travel demand or travel behavior such as severe acute respiratory syndrome avian flu or h1n1 virus or other illness or travel restrictions or reduction in the demand for air travel caused by similar public health threats in the future could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

the company may never realize the full value of its intangible assets or its longlived assets causing it to record impairments that may negatively affect its financial position and results of operations 

in accordance with applicable accounting standards the company is required to test its indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis on october 1 of each year or more frequently if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred in addition the company is required to test certain of its other assets for impairment if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred 

during the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 the company performed impairment tests of certain intangible assets and certain longlived assets principally aircraft related spare engines and spare parts the interim impairment tests were due to events and changes in circumstances that indicated an impairment might have occurred certain of the factors deemed by management to have indicated that impairments may have occurred include a significant decrease in actual and forecasted revenues record high fuel prices significant losses a weak us economy and changes in the planned use of assets as a result of the impairment testing the company recorded significant impairment charges as described in note 21 to the financial statements included in item 8 of this report the company may be required to recognize additional impairments in the future due to among other factors extreme fuel price volatility tight credit markets a decline in the fair value of certain tangible or intangible assets unfavorable trends in historical or forecasted results of operations and cash flows and an uncertain economic environment as well as other uncertainties the company can provide no assurance that a material impairment charge of tangible or intangible assets will not occur in a future period the value of our aircraft could be impacted in future periods by changes in supply and demand for these aircraft such changes in supply and demand for certain aircraft types could result from grounding of aircraft by the company or other carriers an impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the company’s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for us federal income tax purposes may be significantly limited due to various circumstances including certain possible future transactions involving the sale or issuance of ual common stock or if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels 

as of december 31 2011 ual reported consolidated federal net operating loss “nol” carryforwards of approximately 100 billion 

the company’s ability to use its nol carryforwards may be limited if it experiences an “ownership change” as defined in section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended “section 382” an ownership change generally occurs if certain stockholders increase their aggregate percentage ownership of a corporation’s stock by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest percentage ownership at any time during the testing period which is generally the threeyear period preceding any potential ownership change 

there is no assurance that the company will not experience a future ownership change under section 382 that may significantly limit or possibly eliminate its ability to use its nol carryforwards potential future transactions 

  

involving the sale or issuance of ual common stock including the exercise of conversion options under the terms of the company’s convertible debt repurchase of such debt with ual common stock issuance of ual common stock for cash and the acquisition or disposition of such stock by a stockholder owning 5 or more of ual common stock or a combination of such transactions may increase the possibility that the company will experience a future ownership change under section 382 

under section 382 a future ownership change would subject the company to additional annual limitations that apply to the amount of preownership change nols that may be used to offset postownership change taxable income this limitation is generally determined by multiplying the value of a corporation’s stock immediately before the ownership change by the applicable longterm taxexempt rate any unused annual limitation may subject to certain limits be carried over to later years and the limitation may under certain circumstances be increased by builtin gains in the assets held by such corporation at the time of the ownership change this limitation could cause the company’s us federal income taxes to be greater or to be paid earlier than they otherwise would be and could cause all or a portion of the company’s nol carryforwards to expire unused similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes the company’s ability to use its nol carryforwards will also depend on the amount of taxable income it generates in future periods its nol carryforwards may expire before the company can generate sufficient taxable income to use them in full 

ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation limits certain transfers of its stock which could have an effect on the market price of ual common stock 

to reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect on the company’s ability to use its nol carryforwards for federal income tax purposes ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains a 5 ownership limitation this limitation generally remains effective until february 1 2014 or until such later date as may be approved by the ual board of directors the “board of directors” in its sole discretion the limitation prohibits i an acquisition by a single stockholder of shares that results in that stockholder owning 5 or more of ual common stock and ii any acquisition or disposition of common stock by a stockholder that already owns 5 or more of ual common stock unless prior written approval is granted by the board of directors 

any transfer of common stock in violation of these restrictions will be void and will be treated as if such transfer never occurred this provision of ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation may impair or prevent a sale of common stock by a stockholder and adversely affect the price at which a stockholder can sell ual common stock in addition this limitation may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the company creating a perception that a change in control cannot occur or otherwise discouraging takeover attempts that some stockholders may consider beneficial which could also adversely affect the market price of the ual common stock the company cannot predict the effect that this provision in ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation may have on the market price of the ual common stock for additional information regarding the 5 ownership limitation please refer to ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation available on the company’s website 

certain provisions of ual’s governance documents could discourage or delay changes of control or changes to the board of directors 

certain provisions of ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws together the “governance documents” may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the board of directors and may discourage takeover attempts that some of its stockholders may consider beneficial 

certain provisions of the governance documents may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if the board of directors determines that such changes in control are not in the best interests of ual and its stockholders these provisions of the governance documents are not intended to prevent a takeover but are intended to protect and maximize the value of ual’s stockholders’ interests while these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of ual to negotiate with the board of directors they 

  

could enable the board of directors to prevent a transaction that some or a majority of its stockholders might believe to be in their best interests or they could prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

the issuance of additional shares of ual’s capital stock including the issuance of common stock upon conversion of convertible notes and upon a noteholder’s exercise of its option to require ual to repurchase convertible notes could cause dilution to the interests of its existing stockholders 

ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes up to one billion shares of common stock in certain circumstances ual can issue shares of common stock without stockholder approval in addition the board of directors is authorized to issue up to 250 million shares of preferred stock without par value without any action on the part of ual’s stockholders the board of directors also has the power without stockholder approval to set the terms of any series of shares of preferred stock that may be issued including voting rights conversion rights dividend rights preferences over ual’s common stock with respect to dividends or if ual liquidates dissolves or winds up its business and other terms if ual issues preferred stock in the future that has a preference over its common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon its liquidation dissolution or winding up or if ual issues preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of its common stock the rights of holders of its common stock or the market price of its common stock could be adversely affected 

the company is also authorized to issue without stockholder approval other securities convertible into either preferred stock or in certain circumstances common stock as of december 31 2011 ual had 1 billion of convertible debt outstanding holders of these securities may convert them into shares of ual common stock according to their terms in addition certain of ual’s notes include noteholder early redemption options if a noteholder exercises such option ual may elect to pay the repurchase price in cash shares of its common stock or a combination thereof see note 14 to the financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information related to these convertible notes the number of shares issued could be significant and such an issuance could cause significant dilution to the interests of its existing stockholders in addition if ual elects to pay the repurchase price in cash its liquidity could be adversely affected 

in the future ual may decide to raise additional capital through offerings of ual common stock securities convertible into ual common stock or exercise rights to acquire these securities or its common stock the issuance of additional shares of common stock including upon the conversion or repurchase of convertible debt could result in significant dilution of existing stockholders’ equity interests in ual issuances of substantial amounts of its common stock or the perception that such issuances could occur may adversely affect prevailing market prices for ual’s common stock and ual cannot predict the effect this dilution may have on the price of its common stock

2011 financial highlights 

 

  

 2011 operational highlights 

 

  

  

  

 outlook 

set forth below is a discussion of the principal matters that we believe could impact our financial and operating performance and cause our results of operations in future periods to differ materially from our historical 

  

operating results andor from our anticipated results of operations described in our forwardlooking statements in this report see item 1a risk factors  for further discussion of these and other factors that could affect us 

merger integration during 2011 the company received a single operating certificate from the federal aviation administration the “faa” marking a significant achievement in the integration of united and continental the certificate gives the faa a single point of oversight for our combined operations it also allows all maintenance and operating activities to be considered as “united” by the faa 

in 2011 the company announced that mileageplus will be the loyalty program for the company beginning in 2012 

the company has colocated checkin ticket counter and gate facilities at 66 airports since closing the merger and now has a single area for checkin at 291 airports systemwide more than 800 aircraft are now rebranded in the new united livery 

some key initiatives for the company in 2012 include converting to a single passenger service system harmonizing other information technology systems moving to a single website making substantial fleet reallocations around the system and working to integrate certain employee groups we currently expect to migrate to a single passenger service system in early march 2012 allowing the company to operate using a single carrier code flight schedule inventory website and departure control system 

ual expects the merger to deliver 10 billion to 12 billion in net annual synergies on a runrate basis in 2013 including between 800 million and 900 million of annual revenue synergies in large part from expanded customer options resulting from the greater scope and scale of the network fleet optimization and additional international service enabled by the broader network of the company and between 200 million and 300 million of net cost synergies the company has realized an estimated 400 million of synergies in 2011 comprised of 250 million of revenue synergies and 150 million of net cost synergies 

the company will incur substantial expenses in connection with the merger the company incurred approximately 450 million of integrationrelated cash costs in 2011 and expects to incur a similar amount in 2012 in categories generally consistent with 2011 there are many factors that could affect the total amount or the timing of those expenses and many of the expenses that will be incurred are by their nature difficult to estimate accurately see notes 1 and 21 to the financial statements included in item 8 of this report and item 1a risk factors for additional information on the merger 

economic conditions the severe global economic recession in 2008 and 2009 significantly diminished the demand for air travel resulting in a difficult financial environment for us network carriers ual’s financial performance improved significantly in 2010 and 2011 as a result of improving global economic conditions the merger increasing passenger unit revenue and industry capacity discipline although we continue to see indications that the airline industry is experiencing a recovery including stronger demand increasing passenger unit revenue and improving revenue we cannot predict whether the demand for air travel will continue to improve or the rate of such improvement worsening economic conditions such as continued european sovereign debt uncertainty political and socioeconomic tensions in regions such as the middle east and africa may result in diminished demand for air travel and may impair our ability to sustain the profitability we achieved in 2011 going into 2012 

capacity over the past year ual leveraged the flexibility of its combined fleet to better match market demand and added new routes from its hubs on the east and west coasts to international destinations such as lagos nigeria guadalajara mexico montreal canada port au prince haiti providenciales turks and caicos shanghai china and stuttgart germany along with new intraasia routes between its tokyo hub and hong kong and between its guam hub and okinawa japan in addition for 2012 ual expects to add new routes from its hubs to manchester uk buenos aires argentina dublin ireland and durango mexico subject to government approval we expect capacity for 2012 to be relatively flat compared to 2011 should fuel prices increase significantly we would likely adjust our capacity plans downward 

  

additional revenuegenerating and cost saving measures we offer and intend to offer additional goods and services relating to air travel a portion of which will come from “unbundling” our current product and a portion of which will come from goods and services that we do not presently offer the revenues that we derive from these products and services which are generally referred to as ancillary revenues typically have higher margins than that of our core transportation services and are an important element of our strategy to sustain the profitability that we achieved in 2011 and 2010 the “unbundling” of our current products and services as well as our additional valueadded products offer customers flexibility and choice in selecting the products and services they are willing to purchase additionally we expect to continue to invest in technology that is designed to both assist customers with selfservice efficiently and allow us to make better operational decisions while lowering our operating costs 

fuel costs fuel prices continued to be volatile in 2011 ual’s average aircraft fuel price per gallon including related taxes was 306 in 2011 as compared to 239 in 2010 if fuel prices rise significantly from their current levels we may be unable to raise fares or other fees sufficiently to fully offset our increased costs in addition high fuel prices may impair our ability to sustain the profitability we achieved in 2011 and 2010 based on projected fuel consumption in 2012 a one dollar change in the price of a barrel of crude oil would change ual’s annual fuel expense by approximately 95 million to protect against increases in the prices of fuel the company routinely hedges a portion of its future fuel requirements 

labor costs as of december 31 2011 the company had approximately 72 of employees represented by unions we are in the process of negotiating amended collective bargaining agreements with our employee groups the company cannot predict the outcome of negotiations with its unionized employee groups although significant increases in the pay and benefits resulting from new collective bargaining agreements could have an adverse financial impact on the company 

results of operations 

in this section we compare ual’s results of operations for the year ended december 31 2011 with ual’s results on a combined basis for the year ended december 31 2010 ual’s results of operations for 2010 on a combined basis consist of 1 ual’s results of operations for 2010 which includes continental’s results from october 1 to december 31 2010 and 2 continental’s results from january 1 to september 30 2010 given the significant level of integration activity in 2011 we believe this presentation of the 2010 financial results provides a more meaningful basis for comparing ual’s financial performance in 2011 and 2010 this presentation differs from the comparison of 2010 and 2009 results which compares ual’s financial performance yearoveryear excluding the merger impact in 2010 represented by continental successor results in the fourth quarter of 2010 nongaap financial measures are presented because they provide management and investors with the ability to measure and monitor ual’s performance on a consistent basis 

  

2011 compared to 2010 

operating revenue 

 

the table below illustrates the yearoveryear percentage change in ual’s operating revenues for the years ended december 31 in millions except percentage changes 

 

 the table below presents ual’s passenger revenues and operating data based on geographic region 

 

  

 on a combined basis consolidated passenger revenue in 2011 increased approximately 28 billion or 93 as compared to 2010 these increases were due to increases of 122 and 109 in average fare per passenger and yield respectively over the same period as a result of improved pricing primarily from industry capacity discipline the reduced traffic from both business and leisure passengers in 2011 was offset by higher fares which drove improvements in both average fare per passenger and yield the average fare per passenger also increased in the 2011 period as compared to the 2010 period due to a number of fare increases implemented in response to higher fuel prices 

passenger revenue also increased in 2011 as a result of certain accounting changes as described in note 2 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report in conjunction with these changes the company recorded a special adjustment in 2011 to decrease frequent flyer deferred revenue and increase revenue by 107 million in connection with a modification to its cobrand agreement 

cargo revenue increased by 7 million or 06 on a combined basis in 2011 as compared to 2010 reduced cargo volume in 2011 was offset by higher yields ual’s freight ton miles decreased 137 in 2011 as compared to 2010 while mail ton miles improved slightly by 22 during the same period for a composite cargo traffic 

  

decline of 119 freight yields in 2011 increased 18 compared to 2010 due to higher fuel surcharges and processing fees mail yields decreased nearly 10 in 2011 as compared to 2010 in all geographic regions except for latin america 

on a combined basis other operating revenue was up 111 million or 35 in 2011 as compared to 2010 which was primarily due to growth in ancillary passengerrelated charges 

operating expense 

 

the table below includes data related to ual’s operating expense for the year ended december 31 in millions except percentage changes 

 

 the significant increase in aircraft fuel expense was primarily attributable to increased fuel prices as shown in the table below which reflects the significant changes in aircraft fuel cost per gallon for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to the year ended december 31 2010 in millions see note 13 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional details regarding gains and losses from settled fuel hedge positions and unrealized gains and losses at the end of the periods 

 

 salaries and related costs increased 123 million or 16 in 2011 as compared to 2010 the increase was due to several factors including a slight increase in the number of average fulltime employees yearoveryear higher pay rates primarily driven by new collective bargaining agreements increase in seniority levels a onetime signing bonus for certain employee groups and increased accruals in profit sharing and related payroll tax payments in 2011 as compared to 2010 

expenses related to aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs increased by 230 million or 152 in 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily due to increased rates on aircraft engine maintenance 

  

depreciation and amortization increased by 88 million or 6 in 2011 as compared to 2010 due to increased expense associated with the increase in basis from recording continental’s assets at fair value in connection with the merger including the frequent flyer database and the increased capitalization of new projects including those related to united’s international premium travel products which are the products used on our international service 

aircraft rent expense decreased by 180 million or 151 in 2011 as compared to 2010 primarily due to the amortization of a lease fair value adjustment which was recorded as part of acquisition accounting 

the table below presents integration and mergerrelated costs and special items incurred by ual during the years ended december 31 in millions 

 

 integration and mergerrelated costs include compensation costs related to systems integration and training costs to repaint aircraft in the new livery and other branding activities costs to writeoff or accelerate depreciation on systems and facilities that are no longer used or planned to be used for significantly shorter periods severance primarily associated with administrative headcount reductions and a charge related to the company’s obligation to issue 8 contingent senior unsecured notes the “8 notes” see notes 1 and 21 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information related to special items 

nonoperating income expense 

 

the following table illustrates the yearoveryear dollar and percentage changes in ual’s nonoperating income expense in millions except percentage changes 

 

 the decrease in interest expense of 137 million or 126 in 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily due to a decrease in outstanding debt 

in 2011 miscellaneous net included fuel hedge ineffectiveness of 59 million primarily resulting from a decrease in fuel hedge values in excess of the decrease in aircraft fuel prices the ineffectiveness is primarily 

  

related to the company’s portfolio of crude oil derivative contracts in 2010 miscellaneous net included a gain of 21 million from the distribution to united of the remaining united series 20011 enhanced equipment trust certificate “eetc” trust assets upon repayment of the note obligations 

2010 compared to 2009 

operating revenue 

 

to provide a more meaningful comparison of ual’s 2010 financial performance to 2009 we quantified the increases relating to our operating results that are due to continental’s results after the merger closing date the increases due to the merger presented in the tables below represent actual continental successor results for the fourth quarter of 2010 the discussion of ual’s results excludes the impact of continental successor results in the fourth quarter of 2010 

the table below illustrates the yearoveryear percentage change in ual’s operating revenues for the years ended december 31 in millions except percentage changes 

 

 the table below presents selected ual passenger revenue and selected operating data based on geographic region 

 

 excluding the impact of the merger consolidated passenger revenue in 2010 increased approximately 29 billion or 202 as compared to 2009 these increases were due to increases of 186 and 157 in average fare per passenger and yield respectively over the same period as a result of strengthening economic conditions and industry capacity discipline an increase in volume in 2010 as measured by passenger volume also contributed to the increase in revenues in 2010 as compared to 2009 the revenue improvement in 2010 was also driven by the return of business and international premium cabin passengers whose higher ticket prices combined to increase average fare per passenger and yields the international regions in particular had the largest increases in demand with international passenger unit revenue per asm increasing 294 on a 18 increase in capacity passenger revenue in 2010 included approximately 250 million of additional revenue due to changes in the company’s estimate and methodology related to loyalty program accounting as noted in critical accounting policies below 

  

excluding the impact of the merger cargo revenue increased by 177 million or 33 in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to improved economic conditions resulting in improved traffic and yield ual’s freight ton miles improved by 221 in 2010 as compared to 2009 while mail ton miles dropped approximately 88 during the same period for a composite cargo traffic gain of 183 freight yields in 2010 were 15 better than in 2009 due to stronger freight traffic reduced industry capacity and numerous tactical rate recovery initiatives particularly in ual’s pacific markets on a composite basis cargo yield in 2010 increased 126 as compared to 2009 

excluding the impact of the merger other operating revenue was up 235 in 2010 as compared to 2009 which was primarily due to growth in ancillary passengerrelated charges such as baggage fees 

operating expense 

the table below includes data related to ual’s operating expense for the year ended december 31 in millions except percentage changes 

 

 the increase in aircraft fuel expense was primarily attributable to increased market prices for fuel as shown in the table below which reflects the significant changes in aircraft fuel cost per gallon for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to the year ended december 31 2009 the 2010 amounts presented in the table below exclude the impact of continental successor after the closing date of the merger see note 13 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional details regarding gains and losses from settled positions and unrealized gains and losses at the end of the period 

 

 excluding the impact of the merger salaries and related costs increased 297 million or 76 in 2010 as compared to 2009 the increase was primarily due to increased accruals for profit sharing and other annual incentive plans in 2010 ual’s accrual for profit sharing was 166 million expense for the plan was not accrued in 2009 as the profit sharing and other incentive plan payouts were not earned based on ual’s adjusted pretax losses 

  

excluding the impact of the merger regional capacity purchase expense increased 87 million or 57 in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in capacity in the same period 

excluding the impact of the merger distribution expenses increased 86 million or 128 in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in passenger revenue on higher traffic and yields driving increases in commissions credit card fees and gds fees 

excluding the impact of the merger aircraft rent expense decreased by 20 million or 58 in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily as a result of united’s retirement of its entire fleet of boeing 737 aircraft some of which were financed through operating leases this fleet retirement was completed during 2009 

during the fourth quarter of 2010 ual recorded 130 million to other operating expenses 65 million each for united and continental due to revenue sharing obligations related to the transatlantic joint venture with lufthansa and air canada this expense relates to ual’s retroactive payments for the first nine months of 2010 prior to execution of the joint venture agreement 

the table below presents mergerrelated costs and special items incurred by ual during the years ended december 31 in millions 

 

 see note 21 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information related to special items 

mergerrelated costs include costs related to the planning and execution of the merger including costs for items such as financial advisor legal and other advisory fees also included in mergerrelated costs are salary and severance related costs that are primarily associated with administrative headcount reductions and compensation costs related to the merger mergerrelated costs also include integration costs costs to terminate certain service contracts that will not be used by the company costs to writeoff system assets that are no longer used or planned to be used by the company and payments to thirdparty consultants to assist with integration planning and organization design see notes 1 and 21 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information 

the aircraft impairments in 2010 and 2009 are primarily related to a decrease in the estimated market value of ual’s nonoperating boeing 737 and 747 aircraft in 2010 ual recorded a 29 million impairment 18 million net of taxes of its indefinitelived brazil routes due to an estimated decrease in the value of these routes as a result of the open skies agreement between the united states and brazil 

during 2010 ual determined it overstated its deferred tax liabilities by approximately 64 million when it applied fresh start accounting upon its exit from bankruptcy in 2006 under applicable standards in 2008 this error would have been corrected with a decrease to goodwill which would have resulted in a decrease in the amount of ual’s 2008 goodwill impairment charge therefore ual corrected this overstatement in the fourth quarter of 2010 by reducing its deferred tax liabilities and recorded it as a goodwill impairment credit in its statement of consolidated operations the adjustment was not made to prior periods as ual does not believe the correction is material to the 2010 or any prior period 

  

in 2009 ual recorded a 150 million intangible asset impairment 95 million net of taxes to decrease the value of united’s tradename which was primarily due to a decrease in estimated future revenues resulting from the weak economic environment and united’s capacity reductions among other factors 

in 2009 ual recorded special charges of 27 million related to the final settlement of the lax municipal bond litigation and 104 million primarily related to boeing 737 aircraft lease terminations 

nonoperating income expense 

the following table illustrates the yearoveryear dollar and percentage changes in ual’s nonoperating income expense in millions except percentage changes 

 

 the increase in interest expense in 2010 as compared to 2009 excluding the merger impact was primarily due to higher interest rates on average debt outstanding in 2010 as compared to comparable rates on average debt outstanding in 2009 as certain of the company’s financings have terms with higher interest rates as compared to debt that has been repaid the higher interest rates were due to distressed capital markets and the company’s credit and liquidity outlook at the time of the financings 

in 2010 miscellaneous net included a gain of 21 million from the distribution to united of the remaining united series 20011 eetc assets upon repayment of the note obligations in addition miscellaneous net included 10 million of hedge ineffectiveness gains in 2010 on fuel hedge contracts that were designated as cash flow hedges as compared to 31 million of fuel hedge gains in 2009 the fuel hedge gains in 2009 resulted from hedge contracts that were not designated as cash flow hedges  

united and continental—results of operations—2011 compared to 2010 

united and continental’s management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations have been abbreviated pursuant to general instructions i2a of form 10k 

  

united 

the following table presents information related to united’s results of operations in millions except percentage changes 

 

 united had net income of 281 million in 2011 as compared to net income of 399 million in 2010 as compared to 2010 united’s consolidated revenue increased 14 billion or 7 to 212 billion during 2011 these increases were primarily due to yearoveryear capacity discipline which in turn resulted in improved pricing and higher average fares as discussed in ual’s results of operations above united’s traffic and capacity decreased approximately 22 and 19 respectively while passenger revenue per available seat mile increased approximately 80 average fares were also higher due to fare increases implemented in response to higher fuel prices 

united’s passenger revenue also increased in 2011 as a result of certain accounting changes as described in note 2 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report in conjunction with these changes the company recorded a special adjustment to decrease frequent flyer deferred revenue and increase revenue by 88 million in connection with a modification to its chase cobrand agreement in 2011 

united’s operating expenses increased approximately 15 billion or 8 in 2011 as compared to 2010 which was primarily due to the following 

 

  

  

 united’s nonoperating expense decreased 28 million or 44 in 2011 as compared to 2010 which was primarily due to the pay down of debt obligations in 2011 

  

continental 

the table below presents the continental successor and predecessor periods in 2010 the combined presentation for the year ended december 31 2010 does not represent a gaap presentation management believes that the combined nongaap results for 2010 provide a more meaningful comparison to the full year 2011 continental’s operating income and net income in the 2011 period were 950 million and 569 million respectively as compared to operating and net income of 698 million and 346 million respectively in the combined 2010 period these improvements were largely due to yearoveryear capacity discipline 

 

 total revenues increased 127 in 2011 as compared to the combined 2010 period primarily due to higher passenger fares driven by improving global economic conditions and an increased demand for air travel continental’s capacity increased approximately 19 while its traffic remained flat prasm increased approximately 117 continental’s yearoveryear improvement in yield of approximately 131 is driven primarily by increases in its domestic and latin markets additionally the company recorded a special adjustment in 2011 to decrease frequent flyer deferred revenue and increase revenue by 19 million in connection with a modification to its chase cobrand agreement 

aircraft fuel expense increased 372 in 2011 as compared to the combined 2010 period primarily due to an increase in the prices of aircraft fuel continental had fuel hedge gains of 86 million in 2011 as compared to fuel hedge losses of 9 million in 2010 continental’s fuel purchase cost without hedge impacts increased approximately 398 in 2011 as compared to 2010 which is relatively consistent with ual’s unhedged cost of fuel summarized in the tables above 

aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs increased by 61 million or 114 in 2011 as compared to the combined 2010 period primarily due to increased rates on aircraft engine maintenance and the expiration of warranty coverage on certain aircraft parts 

continental’s depreciation and amortization expense increased by 69 million or 124 in 2011 as compared to the combined 2010 period primarily due to increased expense associated with recording continental’s assets at fair value as of the merger closing date 

  

aircraft rent decreased 177 million or 205 in 2011 as compared to the combined 2010 period primarily due to the amortization of a lease fair value adjustment which was recorded as part of acquisition accounting 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2011 ual had 78 billion in unrestricted cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments which is 918 million lower than at december 31 2010 the company also has a 500 million undrawn credit and guaranty agreement the “revolving credit facility” as of december 31 2011 at december 31 2011 ual also had 569 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents which is primarily collateral for performance bonds letters of credit credit card processing agreements and estimated future workers’ compensation claims we may be required to post significant additional cash collateral to provide security for obligations that are not currently backed by cash restricted cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2010 totaled 387 million as of december 31 2011 united had cash collateralized 194 million of letters of credit most of which had previously been issued and collateralized under the amended credit facility as of december 31 2011 the company had all of its commitment capacity under its new 500 million revolving credit facility available for letters of credit or borrowings 

as is the case with many of our principal competitors we have a high proportion of debt compared to capital we have a significant amount of fixed obligations including debt aircraft leases and financings leases of airport property and other facilities and pension funding obligations at december 31 2011 ual had approximately 127 billion of debt and capital lease obligations including 13 billion that are due within the next 12 months in addition we have substantial noncancelable commitments for capital expenditures including the acquisition of new aircraft and related spare engines the company reduced debt and capital lease obligations by 26 billion in 2011 

as of december 31 2011 united had firm commitments to purchase 50 new aircraft 25 boeing 787 aircraft and 25 airbus a350xwb aircraft scheduled for delivery from 2016 through 2019 united also has options to purchase 42 airbus a319 and a320 aircraft and purchase rights for 50 boeing 787 aircraft and 50 airbus a350xwb aircraft united has secured considerable backstop financing commitments from its aircraft and engine manufacturers subject to certain customary conditions however united can provide no assurance that backstop financing or any other financing not already in place for aircraft and engine deliveries will be available to united on acceptable terms when necessary or at all 

as of december 31 2011 continental had firm commitments to purchase 82 new aircraft 57 boeing 737 aircraft and 25 boeing 787 aircraft scheduled for delivery from 2012 through 2016 continental expects to place into service 19 boeing 737 aircraft of which two have been delivered prior to the filing of this report and five boeing 787 aircraft in 2012 continental also has options to purchase 89 additional boeing 737 and 787 aircraft continental does not have backstop financing or any other financing currently in place for the boeing aircraft on order financing will be necessary to satisfy continental’s capital commitments for its firm order aircraft and other related capital expenditures continental can provide no assurance that backstop financing or any other financing not already in place for aircraft and engine deliveries will be available to continental on acceptable terms when necessary or at all 

the company is currently in discussions with boeing over potential compensation related to delays in the 787 aircraft deliveries the company is not able to estimate the ultimate success amount of nature or timing of any potential recoveries from boeing over such delays 

as of december 31 2011 a substantial portion of ual’s assets principally aircraft spare engines aircraft spare parts route authorities and certain other intangible assets was pledged under various loan and other agreements see note 14 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information on assets provided as collateral by the company 

although access to the capital markets improved in 2011 and 2010 as evidenced by our financing transactions in both years we cannot give any assurances that we will be able to obtain additional financing or otherwise access 

  

the capital markets in the future on acceptable terms or at all we must sustain our profitability andor access the capital markets to meet our significant longterm debt and capital lease obligations and future commitments for capital expenditures including the acquisition of aircraft and related spare engines 

the following is a discussion of ual’s sources and uses of cash from 2009 to 2011 as ual applied the acquisition method of accounting to the merger ual’s cash activities discussed below include continental’s activities only after october 1 2010 

cash flows from operating activities 

2011 compared to 2010 

ual’s cash from operating activities increased by 501 million in 2011 as compared to 2010 cash from operations improved due to the company’s improved operational performance in 2011 the company’s increased revenues were offset in part by higher cash operating expenses resulting from the merger including fuel and aircraft maintenance expense 

2010 compared to 2009 

ual’s cash from operating activities increased by 941 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 this yearoveryear increase was primarily due to increased cash from passenger and cargo services higher cash operating expenses including fuel distribution costs and interest expense partially offset the benefit from increased revenues operating cash flows in the 2009 period included the receipt of 160 million related to the relocation of ual’s o’hare cargo facility 

cash flows from investing activities 

2011 compared to 2010 

ual’s capital expenditures were 700 million and 371 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively approximately half of the capital expenditures in 2011 related to aircraft upgrades across the company’s fleet for its international premium travel product as well as various facility and ground equipment projects some of these capital expenditures relate to improvements to assets as a result of the merger also in 2011 the company had purchased nine aircraft that were operated under leases for 88 million and were immediately sold to third parties upon acquisition for proceeds of 72 million 

in december 2011 united cash collateralized 194 million of its letters of credit that had previously been issued and collateralized under the amended credit facility resulting in an increase in restricted cash as discussed in liquidity and capital resources above 

ual increased its shortterm investments net of proceeds by 898 million in 2011 as compared to 2010 this was primarily due to the placement of additional funds with outside money managers and movement of liquid assets from cash to shortterm investments united’s shortterm investments net of proceeds increased by 269 million while continental’s shortterm investments net of proceeds increased by 629 million in 2011 as compared to 2010 

2010 compared to 2009 

ual’s capital expenditures were 371 million and 317 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively included in ual’s 2010 capital expenditures are continental’s capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2010 in addition to cash capital expenditures ual’s asset additions include continental’s acquisition of three boeing 737 aircraft in the fourth quarter of 2010 the proceeds of continental’s eetc financing in the fourth quarter of 2010 described below were directly issued to the aircraft manufacturers therefore these proceeds are not presented as capital expenditures and financing proceeds in the statements of consolidated cash flows ual limited its spending in both 2010 and 2009 by focusing its capital resources only on its highestvalue projects 

  

in 2009 united received 175 million from three saleleaseback agreements these transactions were accounted for as capital leases resulting in an increase to capital lease assets and capital lease obligations during 2009 

cash flows from financing activities 

significant financing events in 2011 were as follows 

 

  

  

 significant financing events in 2010 were as follows 

 

  

  

  

 significant financing events in 2009 for ual and united were as follows 

 

  

   

  

 the proceeds from these transactions were partially offset by 984 million used for scheduled longterm debt and capital lease payments during 2009 as well as 49 million used for payment of various costs associated with such transactions 

for additional information regarding these matters and other liquidity events see notes 5 14 and 15 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report 

credit ratings as of the filing date of this report ual united and continental had the following corporate credit ratings 

 

 these credit ratings are below investment grade levels downgrades from these rating levels among other things could restrict the availability andor increase the cost of future financing for the company 

other liquidity matters 

below is a summary of additional liquidity matters see the indicated notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 of this report for additional details related to these and other matters affecting our liquidity and commitments 

 

 debt covenants certain of the company’s financing agreements have covenants that impose certain operating and financial restrictions as applicable on the company on united and its material subsidiaries or on continental and its subsidiaries among other covenants the amended credit facility requires ual united and certain of united’s material subsidiaries who are guarantors under the amended credit facility to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash balance as defined in the amended credit facility of 10 billion at all times a minimum ratio of collateral value to debt obligations that may increase if a specified dollar value of the route collateral is released and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 15 to 10 for twelve month periods measured at the end of each calendar quarter the revolving credit facility requires the company to maintain at least 30 billion of unrestricted liquidity at all times which includes unrestricted cash short term investments and any undrawn amounts under any revolving credit facility and to maintain a minimum ratio of appraised value of collateral to the outstanding obligations under the revolving credit facility of 167 to 10 among other covenants the indentures governing the senior notes require the issuer to maintain a minimum ratio of collateral value to debt obligations as of certain reference periods if the value of the collateral underlying that issuer’s senior notes declines such that the issuer no longer maintains the minimum required ratio of collateral value to 

  

debt obligations the issuer may be required to pay additional interest at the rate of 2 per annum provide additional collateral to secure the noteholders’ lien or repay a portion of the senior notes a breach of certain of the covenants or restrictions contained in the amended credit facility the revolving credit facility or the indentures governing the senior notes could result in a default and a subsequent acceleration of the applicable debt obligations the indentures governing the united senior notes contain a crossacceleration provision pursuant to which a default resulting in the acceleration of indebtedness under the amended credit facility would result in a default under such indentures the revolving credit facility includes events of default customary for similar financings in addition the amended credit facility and the revolving credit facility contain crossdefault andor crossacceleration provisions pursuant to which default andor acceleration of certain other material indebtedness of the company could result in a default under the amended credit facility the revolving credit facility or both 

capital commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements the company’s business is capital intensive requiring significant amounts of capital to fund the acquisition of assets particularly aircraft in the past the company has funded the acquisition of aircraft through outright purchase by issuing debt by entering into capital or operating leases or through vendor financings the company also often enters into longterm lease commitments with airports to ensure access to terminal cargo maintenance and other required facilities 

the table below provides a summary of ual’s material contractual obligations as of december 31 2011 in millions 

 

  

        

contingencies 

contingent senior unsecured notes 

ual is obligated under an indenture to issue to the pension benefit guaranty corporation “pbgc” up to 500 million aggregate principal amount of 8 notes in up to eight equal tranches of 625 million if a triggering event occurs with each tranche issued no later than 45 days following the end of any applicable fiscal year a triggering event occurs when ual’s ebitdar as defined in the 8 notes indenture exceeds 35 billion over the prior 12 months ending june 30 or december 31 of any applicable fiscal year the 12 month measurement periods began with the fiscal year ended december 31 2009 and will end with the fiscal year ending december 31 2017 if any 8 notes are issued the company will not receive any cash 

financial triggering events under the 8 notes indenture occurred at june 30 2011 and december 31 2011 and as a result ual issued two tranches of 625 million of the 8 notes to the pbgc in january 2012 these tranches will mature 15 years from their respective triggering dates with interest accruing from the triggering date at a rate of 8 per annum the notes are payable in cash in semiannual installments starting june 30 2012 and will be callable at ual’s option at any time at par plus accrued and unpaid interest 

these are the first two such occurrences of ual’s obligation to issue the 8 notes since the issuance of subsequent tranches of the 8 notes is based upon future operating results ual cannot predict whether future issuances will occur or the timing of any such issuances any future issuances of the 8 notes could adversely impact the company’s results of operations because of increased charges to earnings for the then fair value of the principal amount of the notes issued and increased interest expense related to the 8 notes issuance of such notes could adversely impact the company’s liquidity due to increased cash required to meet interest and principal payments 

legal and environmental the company has certain contingencies resulting from litigation and claims incident to the ordinary course of business management believes after considering a number of factors including but not limited to the information currently available the views of legal counsel the nature of contingencies to which the company is subject and prior experience that the ultimate disposition of the litigation and claims will not materially affect the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations the company records liabilities for legal and environmental claims when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable 

other contingencies many aspects of the company’s operations are subject to increasingly stringent federal state and local and international laws protecting the environment future environmental regulatory developments such as climate change regulations in the us and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in the airline industry there are certain laws and regulations relating to climate change that apply to the company including the eu ets which is subject to international dispute environmental taxes for certain international flights including the united kingdom’s air passenger duty and germany’s departure ticket tax limited greenhouse gas reporting requirements and the state of california’s cap and trade regulations which impacts united’s san francisco maintenance center in addition there are landbased planning laws that could apply to airport expansion projects requiring a review of greenhouse gas emissions and could affect airlines in certain circumstances 

as of january 1 2012 the eu ets required the company to ensure that by each compliance date it has obtained sufficient emission allowances equal to the amount of carbon dioxide emissions with respect to flights to and from eu member states in the preceding calendar year such allowances are to be surrendered on an annual basis to the relevant government with an initial compliance date of april 30 2013 for emissions subject to the eu ets in 2012 for 2012 the company estimates it will receive from the united kingdom allowances equal to approximately 80 of the company’s carbon emissions relative to the 2010 base year leaving a remaining amount that will need to be purchased by the company the amount of such allowances provided by the united kingdom is expected to decrease in the future potentially leaving a greater amount of allowances that may be required to be purchased additionally any increase in emissions would require the purchase of additional carbon 

  

allowances by the company as the scheme continues to be the subject of international dispute it is unclear whether or not the inclusion of aviation in the eu ets will be sustained management continues to evaluate what the impact would be for the company in 2012 

offbalance sheet arrangements an offbalance sheet arrangement is any transaction agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has 1 made guarantees 2 a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets 3 an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or 4 any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support or that engages in leasing hedging or research and development arrangements the company’s primary offbalance sheet arrangements include operating leases which are summarized in the contractual obligations table in capital commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements above and certain municipal bond obligations as discussed below as of december 31 2011 the company had cash collateralized 194 million of letters of credit most of which had previously been issued and collateralized under the amended credit facility and 163 million of performance bonds continental had letters of credit and performance bonds relating to various real estate customs and aircraft financing obligations at december 31 2011 in the amount of 71 million most of the united and continental letters of credit have evergreen clauses and are expected to be renewed on an annual basis and the bonds have expiration dates through 2015 

as of december 31 2011 united and continental are the guarantors of approximately 270 million and 16 billion respectively in aggregate principal amount of taxexempt special facilities revenue bonds and interest thereon excluding the us airways contingent liability described below these bonds issued by various airport municipalities are payable solely from rentals paid under longterm agreements with the respective governing bodies the leasing arrangements associated with a majority of these obligations are accounted for as operating leases and are not recorded in united’s and continental’s financial statements the leasing arrangements associated with a minority of these obligations are accounted for as capital leases the annual lease payments for those obligations accounted for as operating leases are included in the operating lease payments in the contractual obligations table in capital commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements above 

continental is contingently liable for us airways’ obligations under a lease agreement between us airways and the port authority of new york and new jersey related to the east end terminal at laguardia which lease agreement was assigned by us airways to delta air lines inc “delta” these obligations include the payment of ground rentals to the port authority and the payment of other rentals in respect of the full amounts owed on special facilities revenue bonds issued by the port authority having an outstanding par amount of 79 million at december 31 2011 and a final scheduled maturity in 2015 if both us airways and delta default on these obligations continental would be obligated to cure the default and would have the right to occupy the terminal after us airways’ and delta’s interest in the lease had been terminated 

increased cost provisions in the company’s financing transactions that include loans the company typically agrees to reimburse lenders for any reduced returns with respect to the loans due to any change in capital requirements and in the case of loans in which the interest rate is based on libor for certain other increased costs that the lenders incur in carrying these loans as a result of any change in law subject in most cases to certain mitigation obligations of the lenders at december 31 2011 ual had 29 billion of floating rate debt consisting of united’s 21 billion and continental’s 820 million of debt and 405 million of fixed rate debt consisting of united’s 205 million and continental’s 200 million of debt with remaining terms of up to ten years that are subject to these increased cost provisions in several financing transactions involving loans or leases from nonus entities with remaining terms of up to ten years and an aggregate balance of 33   billion consisting of united’s 23 billion and continental’s 964 million balance we bear the risk of any change in tax laws that would subject loan or lease payments thereunder to nonus entities to withholding taxes subject to customary exclusions 

fuel consortia the company participates in numerous fuel consortia with other carriers at major airports to reduce the costs of fuel distribution and storage interline agreements govern the rights and responsibilities of the 

  

consortia members and provide for the allocation of the overall costs to operate the consortia based on usage the consortia and in limited cases the participating carriers have entered into longterm agreements to lease certain airport fuel storage and distribution facilities that are typically financed through taxexempt bonds either special facilities revenue bonds or general airport revenue bonds issued by various local municipalities in general each consortium lease agreement requires the consortium to make lease payments in amounts sufficient to pay the maturing principal and interest payments on the bonds as of december 31 2011 approximately 14 billion principal amount of such bonds were secured by significant fuel facility leases in which ual participates as to which ual and each of the signatory airlines have provided indirect guarantees of the debt as of december 31 2011 ual’s contingent exposure was approximately 271 million principal amount of such bonds based on its recent consortia participation as of december 31 2011 united’s and continental’s contingent exposure related to these bonds based on its recent consortia participation was approximately 214 million and 57 million respectively the company’s contingent exposure could increase if the participation of other carriers decreases the guarantees will expire when the taxexempt bonds are paid in full which range from 2011 to 2041 the company did not record a liability at the time these indirect guarantees were made 

united and continental—cash flows activities—2011 compared to 2010 

united 

operating activities 

united’s cash from operating activities decreased by 379 million in 2011 as compared to 2010 this yearoveryear decrease was primarily due to a decrease in frequent flyer deferred revenue and advanced purchase of miles united’s net income in 2011 was 118 million lower than 2010 

investing activities 

united’s capital expenditures were 464 million and 318 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively consistent with ual’s investing activities discussed above united’s capital expenditures in 2011 related to aircraft upgrades across the company’s fleet for its international premium travel product as well as various facility and ground equipment projects 

in 2011 purchases of shortterm investments net of proceeds was 269 million united did not have any shortterm investments in 2010 this yearoveryear increase was primarily due to the placement of additional funds with outside money managers and movement of liquid assets from cash to shortterm investments 

also as of december 31 2011 united had cash collateralized 194 million of letters of credit most of which had previously been issued and collateralized under the amended credit facility resulting in an increase in restricted cash as discussed in liquidity and capital resources above 

financing activities 

united’s significant financing activities in 2011 and 2010 are described in the above discussion of ual’s financing activities in liquidity and capital resources and note 14 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report 

continental 

operating activities 

continental’s cash from operating activities decreased by 411 million in 2011 as compared to the combined 2010 period this yearoveryear decrease was primarily due to a decrease in frequent flyer deferred revenue and advanced purchase of miles a decrease in receivables and a decrease in advance ticket sales 

  

investing activities 

continental’s capital expenditures were 236 million and 300 million in 2011 and 2010 respectively in addition continental acquired aircraft in both 2011 and 2010 with proceeds from financings that were delivered directly to the manufacturer see note 18 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report for information related to these noncash financing and investing activities 

in 2011 purchases of shortterm investments net of proceeds was 629 million as compared to 273 million in 2010 this yearoveryear variance was primarily due to investment of higher cash balances and more funds being placed with outside money managers and moving liquid assets from cash to shortterm investments 

financing activities 

continental’s significant financing activities in 2011 and 2010 are described in the above discussion of ual’s financing activities in liquidity and capital resources and note 14 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report 

critical accounting policies 

critical accounting policies are defined as those that are affected by significant judgments and uncertainties which potentially could result in materially different accounting under different assumptions and conditions the company has prepared the financial statements in conformity with gaap which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions the company has identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of the financial statements 

passenger revenue recognition the value of unused passenger tickets is included in current liabilities as advance ticket sales the company records passenger ticket sales and tickets sold by other airlines for use on united and continental as passenger revenues when the transportation is provided or upon estimated breakage tickets sold by other airlines are recorded at the estimated values to be billed to the other airlines nonrefundable tickets generally expire on the date of the intended flight unless the date is extended by notification from the customer on or before the intended flight date fees charged in association with changes or extensions to nonrefundable tickets are recorded as other revenue at the time the fee is collected the fare on the changed ticket including any additional collection is deferred and recognized in accordance with our transportation revenue recognition policy at the time the transportation is provided change fees related to nonrefundable tickets are considered a separate transaction from the air transportation because they represent a charge for the company’s additional service to modify a previous sale therefore the pricing of the change fee and the initial customer reservation are separately determined and represent distinct earnings processes refundable tickets expire after one year the company records an estimate of breakage revenue for tickets that will expire in twelve months without usage these estimates are based on the evaluation of actual historical results the company recognizes cargo and other revenue as service is provided see separate discussion in frequent flyer accounting below 

frequent flyer accounting united and continental have frequent flyer programs that are designed to increase customer loyalty program participants earn mileage credits “miles” by flying on united continental and certain other participating airlines program participants can also earn miles through purchases from other nonairline partners that participate in the company’s loyalty programs we sell miles to these partners which include credit card issuers retail merchants hotels car rental companies and our participating airline partners miles can be redeemed for free discounted or upgraded air travel and nontravel awards the company records its obligation for future award redemptions using a deferred revenue model 

  

  

in the case of the sale of air services the company recognizes a portion of the ticket sales as revenue when the air transportation occurs and defers a portion of the ticket sale representing the value of the related miles the adoption of accounting standards update 200913 multipledeliverable revenue arrangements—a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force “asu 200913” resulted in the revision of this accounting effective january 1 2011 

under the company’s prior accounting policy the company estimated the weighted average equivalent ticket value by assigning a fair value to the miles that were issued in connection with the sale of air transportation the equivalent ticket value is a weighted average ticket value of each outstanding mile based upon projected redemption patterns for available award choices when such miles are consumed the fair value of the miles was deferred and the residual amount of ticket proceeds was recognized as passenger revenue at the time the air transportation was provided 

the company began applying the new guidance in 2011 and determines the estimated selling price of the air transportation and miles as if each element is sold on a separate basis the total consideration from each ticket sale is then allocated to each of these elements individually on a pro rata basis the estimated selling price of miles is computed using an estimated weighted average equivalent ticket value that is adjusted by a sales discount that considers a number of factors including ultimate fulfillment expectations associated with miles sold in flight transactions to various customer groups 

generally as compared to the historical accounting policy the new accounting policy decreases the value of miles that the company records as deferred revenue and increases the passenger revenue recorded at the time air transportation is provided the application of the new accounting method to passenger ticket transactions resulted in the following estimated increases to revenue in millions except per share amounts 

 

 united and continental also each had significant contracts to sell frequent flyer miles to their cobranded credit card partner chase in june 2011 these contracts were modified and the company entered into the consolidated amended and restated cobranded card marketing services agreement dated june 9 2011 the “cobrand agreement” with chase 

the company historically had two primary revenue elements marketing and air transportation in the case of miles sold to non airline third parties the company applied the material modification provisions of asu 200913 to the cobrand agreement in june 2011 when the contract was amended after the adoption of asu 200913 the company identified five revenue elements in the cobrand agreement the air transportation element represented by the value of the mile generally resulting from its redemption for future air transportation use of the united brand and access to frequent flyer member lists advertising baggage services and airport lounge usage together excluding “the air transportation element” the “marketingrelated deliverables” 

the fair value of the elements is determined using management’s estimated selling price of each element the objective of using the estimated selling price based methodology is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a standalone basis accordingly we determine our best estimate of selling price by considering multiple inputs and methods including but not limited to discounted cash flows brand value volume discounts published selling prices number of miles awarded and number of miles redeemed the company estimated the selling prices and volumes over the term of the cobrand agreement in order to determine the allocation of proceeds to each of the multiple elements to be delivered 

  

  

the estimated selling price of miles calculated is generally consistent with the methodology as described above in passenger revenue recognition 

under accounting prior to the adoption of asu 200913 the company used an equivalent ticket value to determine the fair value of miles the new guidance changed the allocation of arrangement consideration to the number of units of accounting however the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for those units did not change the company records passenger revenue related to the air transportation element when the transportation is delivered the other elements are generally recognized as other operating revenue when earned pending new or materially modified contracts after january 1 2011 certain other nonairline partners who participate in the loyalty programs and to which we sell miles remain subject to our historical residual accounting method 

the application of the new accounting standard decreases the value of the air transportation deliverable related to the cobrand agreement that the company records as deferred revenue and ultimately passenger revenue when redeemed awards are flown and increases the value primarily of the marketingrelated deliverables recorded in other revenue at the time these marketingrelated deliverables are provided the annual impact of this accounting change on operating revenue will decrease over time our ability to project the annual decline for each year is significantly impacted by credit card sales volumes frequent flyer redemption patterns and other factors excluding the effects disclosed in the “special revenue item” section below the impact of adoption of asu 200913 resulted in the following estimated increases to revenue in millions except per share amounts 

 

 effective january 1 2012 ual updated its estimated selling price for miles to the rate at which we sell miles to our star alliance partners participating in reciprocal frequent flyer programs as the estimated selling price for miles management believes this change is a change in estimate and as such the change will be applied as a prospective change effective january 1 2012 the estimated impact of this change is to reduce 2012 consolidated revenue by approximately 100 million 

ual accounts for miles sold and awarded that will never be redeemed by program members which we referred to as “breakage” using the redemption method ual reviews its breakage estimates annually based upon the latest available information regarding redemption and expiration patterns during the first quarter of 2010 ual obtained additional historical data previously unavailable which enabled it to refine its estimate of the amount of breakage in its population of miles increasing the estimate of miles in the population expected to expire both the change in estimate and methodology have been applied prospectively effective january 1 2010 ual and united estimate these changes increased passenger revenue by approximately 250 million or 121 per ual basic share 099 per ual diluted share in the year ended december 31 2010 

the company’s estimate of the expected expiration of miles requires significant management judgment current and future changes to expiration assumptions or to the expiration policy or to program rules and program redemption opportunities may result in material changes to the deferred revenue balance as well as recognized revenues from the programs 

  

the following table summarizes information related to the company’s frequent flyer deferred revenue 

 

 in 2011 the company announced that mileageplus will be the loyalty program for the company beginning in 2012 moving to a single loyalty program will be a significant milestone in the integration of the two airlines continental’s onepass program will formally end in the first quarter of 2012 at which point united will automatically enroll onepass members in mileageplus and deposit into those mileageplus accounts award miles equal to their onepass award miles balance the company currently does not expect a material impact in redemptions from merging its two loyalty programs 

asset impairments goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually as of october 1 or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired longlived assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever an indicator of impairment exists 

goodwill as of december 31 2011 represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of continental’s assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the merger all goodwill and other purchase accounting adjustments have been pushed down to continental’s financial statements 

goodwill is measured for impairment by initially comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value a second step is performed to determine the implied fair value of goodwill if the implied fair value of goodwill is lower than its carrying value an impairment charge equal to the difference is recorded 

the company has one consolidated reporting unit in 2011 the company estimated the fair value of the consolidated reporting unit using both an income and a market approach the income approach computes fair value by discounting future cash flows of the business and is dependent on a number of critical management assumptions including estimates of future capacity passenger yield traffic operating costs including fuel prices appropriate discount rates and other relevant assumptions the market approach computes fair value by adding a control premium to the company’s market capitalization the company’s fair value exceeded its carrying value under both approaches and no goodwill impairment was recorded in 2011 

the company is also required to assess the goodwill recorded on the separate financial statements of continental for impairment the fair value of continental was determined by allocating a percentage of the fair value of the consolidated company as determined and described in the paragraph above the percentage of the consolidated fair value allocated to continental was based on a number of measures including revenue share operating earnings share available seat mile share revenue passenger mile share and passenger share based on these criteria this resulted in a fair value allocation of such assets to continental and united of 44 and 56 respectively the fair value of continental exceeded its carrying value and no goodwill impairment was recorded as of december 31 2011 

the company’s indefinitelived intangible assets include certain international route authorities takeoff and landing slots at various airports airline partner alliances the ual trade name and logo the fair values of the assets for purposes of the annual impairment test were determined using the market and income approaches the fair value measurements were primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market we utilized the market approach to value certain intangible assets such as airport takeoff and landing slots when sufficient market information was available the income approach was primarily used to value the international 

  

route authorities airline partner alliances the ual logo and trade name and certain airport takeoff and landing slots the income approach indicates value for a subject asset based on the present value of cash flows projected to be generated by the asset projected cash flows are discounted at a required market rate of return that reflects the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money 

in most cases these indefinitelived assets are separately associated with and directly assignable to each separate subsidiary in cases where the asset is shared between separate subsidiaries the fair value was allocated using the same method as described above for the goodwill impairment test any impairment charges resulting from the testing of the fair values of these indefinitelived intangible assets are also assigned to the applicable separate subsidiary 

ual recorded impairment charges for indefinitelived intangible assets of 4 million and 29 million during the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively in 2011 continental recorded a 4 million impairment of certain intangible assets related to foreign takeoff and landing slots due to a change in our slot allocation times in 2010 ual recorded a 29 million impairment of its brazil routes primarily due to the open skies agreement between the united states and brazil which may result in a decrease in revenue from these routes the valuation of the brazil routes is based on an income methodology using estimated future cash flows from operation of the routes 

in 2009 using an income methodology which was based on estimated future cash flows united recorded impairment charges of 150 million to decrease the carrying value of its tradename the most significant impact on the estimated fair value was a significant decrease in actual and forecasted revenues due to poor global economic conditions 

accounting for longlived assets the net book value of operating property and equipment for ual was 164 billion and 169 billion at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively the assets’ recorded value is impacted by a number of accounting policy elections including the estimation of useful lives and residual values and when necessary the recognition of asset impairment charges 

the company records assets acquired including aircraft at acquisition cost depreciable life is determined through economic analysis such as reviewing existing fleet plans obtaining appraisals and comparing estimated lives to other airlines that operate similar fleets older generation aircraft are assigned lives that are generally consistent with the experience of united and continental and the practice of other airlines as aircraft technology has improved useful life has increased and the company has generally estimated the lives of those aircraft to be 30 years residual values are estimated based on historical experience with regard to the sale of both aircraft and spare parts and are established in conjunction with the estimated useful lives of the related fleets residual values are based on current dollars when the aircraft are acquired and typically reflect asset values that have not reached the end of their physical life both depreciable lives and residual values are revised periodically as facts and circumstances arise to recognize changes in the company’s fleet plan and other relevant information a one year increase in the average depreciable life of ual’s flight equipment would reduce annual depreciation expense on flight equipment by approximately 45 million 

united’s aircraft impairments during 2010 and 2009 were due to aircraft that were grounded or planned to be grounded or certain aircraft that were not operated by united the aircraft impairments primarily related to united’s boeing 737 fleet which united removed from service and five boeing 747 aircraft which it removed from service as part of united’s capacity reduction plans that were initiated in 2008 fair value was estimated using the market approach asset appraisals published aircraft pricing guides and recent transactions for similar aircraft were considered by united in its market value determination several impairments of the boeing 737 and 747 aircraft occurred from 2008 to 2010 due to the weak economy and reduced demand for these particular aircraft among other factors 

in addition to the boeing 737 and 747 aircraft in 2009 ual tested five of its owned regional jets which were leased to a third party for impairment due to a weak market for these aircraft and a remaining lease term of 

  

approximately one year as a result of this testing ual recorded impairment charges of 19 million to record the regional aircraft at estimated fair value as of december 31 2009 

benefit accounting ual’s pension plans’ underfunded status was 18 billion at december 31 2011 nearly all of which is attributable to continental’s plans funding requirements for taxqualified defined benefit pension plans are determined by government regulations we estimate that our minimum funding requirements for the continental plans during calendar year 2012 is approximately 184 million the fair value of the plans’ assets was 19 billion at december 31 2011 of which 17 billion is attributed to assets of continental’s plans 

the following discussion relates only to the continental plans as the united plans are not material 

when calculating pension expense for 2012 continental assumed that its plans’ assets would generate a longterm rate of return of 775 the expected longterm rate of return assumption was developed based on historical experience and input from the trustee managing the plans’ assets   the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of assets which is based on a goal of earning the highest rate of return while maintaining risk at acceptable levels our projected longterm rate of return is slightly higher than some market indices due to the active management of our plans’ assets and is supported by the historical returns on our plans’ assets the plans strive to have assets sufficiently diversified so that adverse or unexpected results from one security class will not have an unduly detrimental impact on the entire portfolio we regularly review actual asset allocation and the pension plans’ investments are periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 

the combined ual defined benefit pension plans’ assets consist of return generating investments and risk mitigating investments which are held through direct ownership or through interests in common collective trusts return generating investments include primarily equity securities fixedincome securities and alternative investments eg private equity and hedge funds risk mitigating investments include primarily us government and investment grade corporate fixedincome securities the allocation of assets was as follows at december 31 2011 

 

 pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases when calculating pension expense for 2012 we assume that our plans’ assets will generate a weightedaverage longterm rate of return of 775 lowering the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets by an additional 50 basis points from 775 to 725 would increase estimated 2012 pension expense by approximately 8 million 

future pension obligations for the continental plans were discounted using a weighted average rate of 513 at december 31 2011 ual selected the 2011 discount rate for each of its plans by using a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds at december 31 2011 that would provide the necessary cash flows to match the projected benefit payments 

ual selected the 2011 discount rate for each of its plans by using a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds at december 31 2011 that would provide the necessary cash flows to match projected benefit payments prior to 2011 the discount rate was selected using a cash flow matching technique where projected benefit payments were matched to a yield curve based on high quality bond yields as of the measurement date this change increased the discount rate which lowered the present value of the liability by approximately 325 million 

  

this approach can result in different discount rates for different plans depending on each plan’s projected benefit payments the pension liability and future pension expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points from 513 to 463 would increase the pension liability at december 31 2011 by approximately 325   million and increase the estimated 2012 pension expense by approximately 41 million 

future changes in plan asset returns plan provisions assumed discount rates pension funding law and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future 

other postretirement benefit accounting united’s postretirement plan provides certain health care benefits primarily in the us to retirees and eligible dependents as well as certain life insurance benefits to certain retirees reflected as “other benefits” continental’s retiree medical programs permit retirees who meet certain age and service requirements to continue medical coverage between retirement and medicare eligibility eligible employees are required to pay a portion of the costs of their retiree medical benefits which in some cases may be offset by accumulated unused sick time at the time of their retirement plan benefits are subject to copayments deductibles and other limits as described in the plans 

the company accounts for other postretirement benefits by recognizing the difference between plan assets and obligations or the plan’s funded status in its financial statements other postretirement benefit expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees’ approximate service periods and is generally calculated independently of funding decisions or requirements the company has not been required to prefund its current and future plan obligations which has resulted in a significant net obligation as discussed below 

ual’s benefit obligation was 254 billion and 249 billion for the other postretirement benefit plans at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively the yearoveryear increase is due to changes in the assumptions used to value the obligation for ual’s plan such as the decrease in the discount rate 

the calculation of other postretirement benefit expense and obligations requires the use of a number of assumptions including the assumed discount rate for measuring future payment obligations and the health care cost trend rate ual determines the appropriate discount rate for each of its plans based on current rates on high quality corporate bonds that would generate the cash flow necessary to pay plan benefits when due united’s weighted average discount rate to determine its benefit obligations as of december 31 2011 was 493 as compared to 515 for december 31 2010 continental’s weighted average discount rate to determine its benefit obligations as of december 31 2011 was 478 as compared to 497 for december 31 2010 the health care cost trend rate assumed by united and continental for 2011 was 8 and 75 respectively as compared to assumed trend rate for 2012 of 7 a 10 increase decrease in assumed health care trend rates would increase decrease ual’s total service and interest cost for the year ended december 31 2011 by 21 million and 18 million respectively a one percentage point decrease in the weighted average discount rate would increase ual’s postretirement benefit liability by approximately 308 million and increase the estimated 2011 benefits expense by approximately 21 million 

ual selected the 2011 discount rate for each of its plans by using a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds at december 31 2011 that would provide the necessary cash flows to match the projected benefit payments prior to 2011 the discount rate was selected using a cash flow matching technique where projected benefit payments were matched to a yield curve based on high quality bond yields as of the measurement date this change increased the discount rate which lowered the present value of the liability by approximately 200 million 

detailed information regarding the company’s other postretirement plans including key assumptions is included in note 9 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report 

actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions under the applicable accounting standards for postretirement welfare benefit plans those gains and 

  

losses are not required to be recognized currently as other postretirement expense but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into expense over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees the company’s accounting policy for postretirement welfare benefit plans is to not apply the corridor approach available under applicable gaap with respect to amortization of amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income under the corridor approach amortization of any gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income is required only if at the beginning of the year the accumulated gain or loss exceeds 10 of the greater of the benefit obligation or the fair value of assets if amortization is required the minimum amount outside the corridor divided by the average remaining service period of active employees is recognized as expense the corridor approach is intended to reduce volatility of amounts recorded in postretirement welfare benefit plan expense each year since the company has elected not to apply the corridor approach all gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are amortized to expense over the remaining years of service of the covered active employees at december 31 2011 and 2010 ual had unrecognized actuarial gains for postretirement welfare benefit plans of 33 million and 24 million respectively recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 

income taxes 

the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income including the reversals of deferred tax liabilities during the periods in which those deferred tax assets will become deductible the company’s management assesses available positive and negative evidence regarding the realizability of its deferred tax assets and records a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized to form a conclusion management considers positive evidence in the form of reversing temporary differences projections of future taxable income and tax planning strategies and negative evidence such as recent history of losses prior to 2011 the company was in a cumulative threeyear loss position which we weighted as a significant source of negative evidence indicating the need for a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets although the company was no longer in a threeyear cumulative loss position at the end of 2011 management determined that the size and frequency of financial losses in recent years and the uncertainty associated with projecting future taxable income supported the conclusion that the valuation allowance was still needed on net deferred assets if ual achieves significant profitability in 2012 then management will evaluate whether its recent history of profitability constitutes sufficient positive evidence to support a reversal of a portion or all of the remaining valuation allowance

 a change in market interest rates would also impact interest income earned on our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments assuming our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments remain at their average 2011 levels a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a corresponding increase in ual united and continental interest income of approximately 63 million 37 million and 26 million respectively during 2012 

commodity price risk aircraft fuel our results of operations and liquidity are significantly impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel 

  

to protect against increases in the prices of aircraft fuel the company routinely hedges a portion of its future fuel requirements the company uses fixed price swaps purchased call options collars or other such commonly used financial hedge instruments these hedge instruments are based directly on aircraft fuel or closely related commodities like heating oil diesel fuel and crude oil the company strives to maintain fuel hedging levels and exposure such that the company’s fuel cost is not disproportionate to the fuel costs of its major competitors 

some hedge instruments may result in losses if the underlying commodity prices drop below specified floors or swap prices however the negative impact of these losses may be outweighed by the benefit of lower aircraft fuel cost since the company typically hedges a portion of its future fuel requirements and uses swaps or sold puts as a part of a collar on only a portion of the fuel requirement that it does hedge the company does not enter into hedge instruments for trading purposes 

the company may adjust its hedging program based on changes in market conditions the following table summarizes information related to the company’s cost of fuel and hedging in millions except percentages 

 

  

    as of december 31 2011 our projected fuel requirements for 2012 were hedged as follows 

 

  

 foreign currency the company generates revenues and incurs expenses in numerous foreign currencies changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the company’s results of operations through changes in the dollar value of foreign currencydenominated operating revenues and expenses some of the company’s more significant foreign currency exposures include the canadian dollar chinese renminbi european euro and 

  

japanese yen at times the company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency the company does not enter into derivative instruments for nonrisk management purposes 

the result of a uniform 10 percent strengthening in the value of the us dollar from december 31 2011 levels relative to each of the currencies in which the company has foreign currency exposure would result in a decrease in pretax income of approximately 235 million for the year ending december 31 2012 this sensitivity analysis was prepared based upon projected 2012 foreign currencydenominated revenues and expenses as of december 31 2011

operations 

united and continental transport people and cargo through their mainline operations which utilize fullsized jet aircraft and regional operations which utilize smaller aircraft that are operated under contract by united express continental express and continental connection carriers see item 2 properties  for a description of the company’s mainline and regional aircraft 

with key global air rights in the us pacific region europe middle east africa and latin america ual has the world’s most comprehensive global route network ual through united and continental and their regional carriers operates approximately 5800 flights a day to more than 375 us domestic and international destinations from the company’s hubs at ab won pat international airport “guam” chicago o’hare international airport “chicago o’hare” denver international airport “denver” george bush intercontinental airport “houston bush” hopkins international airport “cleveland hopkins” los angeles international airport “lax” newark liberty international airport “new york liberty” san francisco international airport “sfo” and washington dulles international airport “washington dulles” including its regional operations united operates approximately 3350 flights a day to more than 235 us domestic and international destinations based on its annual flight schedule as of january 1 2011 including its regional operations continental operates approximately 2500 flights a day to more than 280 us domestic and international destinations based on its annual flight schedule as of january 1 2011 

all of the company’s domestic hubs are located in large business and population centers contributing to a large amount of “origin and destination” traffic our hub and spoke system allows us to transport passengers between a large number of destinations with substantially more frequent service than if each route were served directly our hub system also allows us to add service to a new destination from a large number of cities using only one or a limited number of aircraft as discussed under alliances below united and continental are both members of star alliance the world’s largest airline network 

  

the company offers a different set of services to target distinct customer groups this strategy of market and product segmentation is intended to optimize margins and costs and is focused on delivering an improved experience for all customers and a bestinclass experience for premium customers some of these services include

united 

 

  

  

  

 continental 

 

  

  

  

 regional carriers  the company has contractual relationships with various regional carriers to provide regional jet and turboprop service branded as united express continental express and continental connection these regional operations are an extension of the company’s mainline network this regional service complements our operations by carrying traffic that connects to our mainline service and allows more frequent flights to smaller cities than could be provided economically with full sized mainline jet aircraft atlantic southeast airlines chautauqua airlines colgan airlines “colgan” commutair airlines expressjet airlines gojet airlines mesa airlines shuttle america skywest airlines “skywest” and trans states airlines 

  

“trans states” are all regional carriers most of which operate under capacity purchase agreements with united andor continental under these agreements the company pays the regional carriers contractuallyagreed fees carriercontrolled costs for operating these flights plus a variable reimbursement incentive payment for superior operational performance based on agreed performance metrics the carriercontrolled costs are based on specific rates for various operating expenses of the regional carriers such as crew expenses maintenance and aircraft ownership some of which are multiplied by specific operating statistics eg block hours departures while others are fixed monthly amounts under these capacity purchase agreements the company is responsible for all fuel costs incurred as well as landing fees facilities rent and other costs which are passed through without any markup in return the regional carriers operate this capacity on schedules determined by the company the company also determines pricing revenues and inventory levels and assumes the inventory and distribution risk for the available seats 

while the regional carriers operating under capacity purchase agreements comprise more than 95 of all regional flights the company also has prorate agreements with hyannis air service inc “cape air” colgan gulfstream international airlines “gulfstream” skywest and trans states under prorate agreements the company and its prorate partners agree to divide revenue collected from each passenger according to a formula while both the company and the prorate partners are individually responsible for their own costs of operations unlike capacity purchase agreements under a prorate agreement the regional carrier retains the control and risk of scheduling market selection local seat pricing and inventory for its flights although the carriers may coordinate schedules to maximize connections 

financial information on the company’s operating revenues by geographic regions as reported to the us department of transportation the “dot” can be found in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and note 10 to the financial statements included in item 8 of this report 

alliances united and continental have a number of bilateral and multilateral alliances with other airlines which enhance travel options for customers seeking access to markets that united and continental do not serve directly these marketing alliances typically include one or more of the following features joint loyalty program participation codesharing of flight operations whereby seats on one carrier’s selected flights can be marketed under the brand name of another carrier coordination of reservations ticketing passenger checkin baggage handling and flight schedules and other resourcesharing activities 

united and continental are members of star alliance a global integrated airline network cofounded by united in 1997 and the most comprehensive airline alliance in the world as of january 1 2011 star alliance carriers served 1160 airports in 181 countries with 21000 daily flights current star alliance partners in addition to united and continental are adria airways aegean airlines air canada air china air new zealand all nippon airways asiana airlines austrian airlines blue1 bmi brussels airlines croatia airlines egyptair lot polish airlines lufthansa scandinavian airlines singapore airlines south african airways spanair swiss international air lines tam tap portugal thai turkish airlines and us airways air india aviancataca and copa airlines have been announced as future star alliance members 

in september 2010 united continental and air canada entered into a memorandum of understanding to establish a revenuesharing transborder joint venture subject to the execution of a definitive joint venture agreement completion of necessary filings receipt of regulatory approvals and finalization of documentation united continental and air canada have antitrust immunity from the dot for transborder coordination the joint venture is currently under review by the canadian competition bureau 

in november 2010 united continental and all nippon airways received antitrust immunity approval from the japanese government and the dot enabling the carriers to establish a transpacific joint venture to integrate the services they operate between the united states and japan and other destinations in asia and to derive potentially significant benefits from coordinated scheduling pricing sales and inventory management the integration of services will also allow the three carriers to offer passengers highly competitive flight schedules fares and services we expect this joint venture to commence in the second quarter of 2011 

  

in december 2010 pursuant to antitrust immunity approval granted by the dot united continental air canada and lufthansa executed a joint venture agreement covering transatlantic routes the joint venture is expected to deliver highly competitive flight schedules fares and service the european commission which has been conducting a parallel review of the competitive effects of the joint venture similar to the dot’s review has not yet completed its review the joint venture has a revenuesharing structure that results in payments among participants based on a formula that compares current period unit revenue performance on transatlantic routes to an historic period or “baseline” which is reset annually the payments are calculated on a quarterly basis and subject to a cap the revenue sharing aspects of this joint venture were retroactive to january 2010 see industry regulation below 

united and continental have independent marketing agreements with other air carriers including aer lingus cape air colgan copa airlines emirates eva airways corporation great lakes aviation gulfstream hawaiian airlines island air qatar airways taca group and virgin atlantic airways in addition continental has a traintoplane alliance with amtrak 

fuel aircraft fuel has been the company’s single largest operating expense for the last several years the table below summarizes ual’s fuel cost data excluding hedge impacts during the last three years 

 

  

   the availability and price of aircraft fuel significantly affects the company’s operations results of operations and financial position to ensure adequate supplies of fuel and to obtain a measure of control over prices in the short term the company arranges to have fuel shipped on major pipelines and stored close to its major hub locations to protect against increases in the prices of fuel the company routinely hedges a portion of its future fuel requirements provided the hedges are expected to be cost effective the company uses fixed price swaps purchased call options collars or other such commonly used financial hedge instruments based on aircraft fuel or closely related commodities like heating oil and crude oil the company strives to maintain fuel hedging levels and exposure generally consistent with industry standards so that the company’s fuel cost is not disproportionate to the fuel costs of its major competitors 

loyalty programs united’s mileage plus program and continental’s onepass program build customer loyalty by offering awards and services to program participants members in these programs can earn mileage credit for flights on united united express continental continental express and continental connection members of star alliance and certain other airlines that participate in the programs miles can also be earned by purchasing the goods and services of our nonairline partners such as retail merchants hotels car rental companies and credit card issuers mileage credits can be redeemed for free discounted or upgraded travel and nontravel awards at december 31 2010 united and continental had more than 58 million and 41 million members respectively enrolled in their programs 

both of the company’s loyalty programs have cobrand agreements with chase bank usa na “chase” under these agreements loyalty program members accrue frequent flyer miles for making purchases using mileage plus and onepass credit cards issued by chase these cobrand agreements provide for joint marketing of the credit card programs and provide chase with other benefits such as permission to market to the company’s customer database 

  

in 2010 24 million mileage plus travel awards were used on united as compared to 21 million and 23 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively these awards represented 75 83 and 91 of united’s total revenue passenger miles in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively also in 2010 16 million onepass travel awards were used on continental as compared to 13 million and 16 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively these awards represented 57 59 and 84 of continental’s total revenue passenger miles in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

in addition mileage plus members redeemed miles for approximately 975000 nonunited travel awards in 2010 as compared to 885000 in 2009 nonunited travel awards include red carpet club memberships car and hotel awards merchandise and travel solely on another air carrier among others the increase in the number of nonunited travel awards redeemed in 2010 was due to the expansion of the merchandise programs and the launch of a new car and hotel award program in the fourth quarter of 2009 total miles redeemed for travel on united in 2010 including classofservice upgrades represented 86 of the total miles redeemed for both completed and future travel 

distribution channels the majority of the company’s airline seat inventory continues to be distributed through the traditional channels of travel agencies and global distribution systems “gds” the growing use of internal websites such as wwwunitedcom and wwwcontinentalcom alternative distribution systems and new gds entrants provides the company with an opportunity to decommoditize its services better control its content make more targeted offerings retain its customers enhance its brand and lower its ticket distribution costs to encourage customer use of lowercost channels and capitalize on these costsaving opportunities the company will continue to expand the capabilities of its websites and explore alternative distribution channels 

industry conditions 

economic conditions the company’s costs and revenues are highly correlated to the economic health and growth of the united states and the global markets the company serves the company’s financial performance improved significantly in 2010 consistent with the improvement in global economic conditions similarly the company’s results were adversely impacted in 2009 and 2008 as the global recession experienced over this period resulted in significant declines in industry passenger demand accompanied by a reduction in fare levels the drop in demand was greater among business and premium cabin travelers as corporations significantly reduced their spending on business travel as discussed further in item 1a risk factors  and in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations adverse economic conditions have had and in the future may have negative impacts on passenger demand and revenue 

domestic competition the domestic airline industry is highly competitive and dynamic in domestic markets new and existing us carriers are generally free to initiate service between any two points within the united states the company’s competitors consist primarily of other airlines and to a lesser extent other forms of transportation and emerging technological substitutes such as videoconferencing competition can be direct in the form of another carrier flying the exact nonstop route or indirect where a carrier serves the same two cities nonstop from an alternative airport in that city or via an itinerary requiring a connection at another airport 

carriers that operate as low cost carriers or that have lower cost structures achieved through reorganization may be more competitive with the rest of the industry resulting in lower fares for such carriers’ passengers with a potential negative impact on the company’s revenues in addition future airline mergers or acquisitions may enable airlines to improve their revenue and cost performance relative to peers and thus enhance their competitive position within the industry 

domestic pricing decisions are largely affected by the need to be competitive with other us airlines fare discounting by competitors has historically had a negative effect on our financial results because we often find it necessary to match competitors’ fares to maintain passenger traffic attempts by the company and other airlines to raise fares often fail due to a lack of competitive matching 

  

international competition in international markets the company competes not only with us airlines but also with foreign carriers competition on specified international routes is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulations the united states and european union “eu” agreement in 2008 to reduce restrictions on flight operations between the two regions has increased competition for united’s transatlantic network from both us and european airlines in our pacific operations competition is expected to increase as the governments of the united states and china recently approved additional us and chinese airlines to fly new routes between the two countries although the commencement of some new services to china was postponed due to the weak global economy competition in the pacific is also expected to increase as a result of the execution of the open skies agreement between the united states and japan in october 2010 see industry regulation  below competition in the pacific may also increase if japan airlines which filed for bankruptcy in january 2010 and received reorganization plan approval in november 2010 becomes a stronger competitor in the region as a result of its restructuring part of the company’s ability to compete successfully with nonus carriers on international routes is its ability to generate traffic from and to the entire us via its integrated domestic route network foreign carriers are currently prohibited by us law from carrying local passengers between two points in the us and the company experiences comparable restrictions in many foreign countries in addition us carriers are often constrained from carrying passengers to points beyond designated international gateway cities due to limitations in air service agreements and restrictions imposed unilaterally by foreign governments to compensate partially for these structural limitations us and foreign carriers have entered into alliances and marketing arrangements that allow these carriers to exchange traffic between each other’s flights and route networks see alliances above for further information 

seasonality the air travel business is subject to seasonal fluctuations historically second and third quarter revenues which reflect higher travel demand are better than first and fourth quarter revenues which reflect lower travel demand 

industry regulation 

domestic regulation 

general all carriers engaged in air transportation in the us are subject to regulation by the dot among its responsibilities the dot issues certificates of public convenience and necessity for domestic air transportation no air carrier unless exempted may provide air transportation without a dot certificate of public convenience and necessity the dot also grants international route authorities approves international codeshare arrangements regulates methods of competition and enforces certain consumer protection statutes and regulations such as those dealing with advertising denied boarding compensation and baggage liability 

airlines are also regulated by the federal aviation administration “faa” a division of the dot primarily in the areas of flight operations maintenance and other safety and technical matters the faa has authority to issue air carrier operating certificates and aircraft airworthiness certificates prescribe maintenance procedures and regulate pilot and other employee training among other responsibilities from time to time the faa issues rules that require air carriers to take certain actions such as the inspection or modification of aircraft and other equipment that may cause the company to incur substantial unplanned expenses the airline industry is also subject to various other federal laws and regulations the us department of homeland security “dhs” has jurisdiction over virtually all aspects of civil aviation security see legislation  below the us department of justice “doj” has jurisdiction over certain airline competition matters the us postal service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail labor relations in the airline industry are generally governed by the railway labor act “rla” the company is also subject to inquiries by the dot faa doj and other us and international regulatory bodies 

airport access access to landing and takeoff rights or “slots” at several major us airports and many foreign airports served by united and continental are or recently have been subject to government regulation federally mandated domestic slot restrictions currently apply at reagan national airport in washington dc 

  

“washington reagan” john f kennedy international airport “jfk” laguardia airport “laguardia” and new york liberty in addition to address concerns about airport congestion the faa has designated certain airports including new york liberty jfk and laguardia as “high density traffic airports” and has imposed operating restrictions at these three airports which may include capacity reductions additional restrictions on airline routes and takeoff and landing slots may be proposed in the future that could affect the company’s rights of ownership and transfer 

legislation the airline industry is subject to legislative activity that may have an impact on operations and costs in addition to federal state and local taxes and fees that the company is currently subject to proposed taxes and fees are currently pending that may increase the company’s operating costs if imposed on the company congress is currently attempting to pass comprehensive reauthorization legislation to impose a new funding structure and make other changes to faa operations past aviation reauthorization bills have affected a wide range of areas of interest to the industry including air traffic control operations capacity control issues airline competition issues aircraft and airport technology requirements safety issues taxes fees and other funding sources congress may also pass other legislation that could increase labor and operating costs climate change legislation which would regulate greenhouse gas emissions is also likely to be a significant area of legislative and regulatory focus and could adversely impact the company’s costs see environmental regulation  below 

in april 2010 the dot implemented a new rule requiring certain air carriers including united and continental to adopt contingency plans for tarmac delays exceeding three hours at most us airports a carrier’s failure to meet certain service performance criteria under the rule could subject it to substantial civil penalties the dot has also proceeded with other regulatory changes in this area including proposals regarding treatment of and payments to passengers involuntarily denied boarding domestic baggage liability and airline scheduling practices additionally since september 11 2001 aviation security has been and continues to be a subject of frequent legislative and regulatory action requiring changes to the company’s security processes and frequently increasing the cost of its security procedures 

in september 2010 the faa proposed changes to flight crew duty and rest requirements for all us airlines operating under part 121 of faa regulations these changes if adopted by the faa as initially proposed would likely require us to make changes to our flight operations that could materially increase our costs continental united and other airlines and trade associations have submitted comments to the faa to reduce these proposed burdens substantially but it is unclear at this time whether the faa will adopt them in its final rule 

international regulation 

general international air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation in connection with the company’s international services the company is regulated by both the us government and the governments of the foreign countries united and continental serve in addition the availability of international routes to us carriers is regulated by aviation agreements between the us and foreign governments and in some cases fares and schedules require the approval of the dot andor the relevant foreign governments 

airport access historically access to foreign markets has been tightly controlled through bilateral agreements between the us and each foreign country involved these agreements regulate the markets served the number of carriers allowed to serve each market and the frequency of carriers’ flights since the early 1990s the us has pursued a policy of “open skies” meaning all usflag carriers have access to the destination under which the us government has negotiated a number of bilateral agreements allowing unrestricted access between us and foreign markets currently there are more than 100 open skies agreements in effect additionally many of the airports that united and continental serve in europe asia and latin america maintain slot controls a large number of these are restrictive due to congestion at these airports london heathrow international airport “london heathrow” frankfurt rheinmain airport shanghai pudong 

  

international airport beijing capital international airport sao paulo guarhulos international airport and tokyo narita international airport are among the most restrictive airports due to capacity limitations united and continental have significant operations at these locations 

the company’s ability to serve some foreign markets and expand into certain others is limited by the absence of aviation agreements between the us government and the relevant foreign governments shifts in us or foreign government aviation policies may lead to the alteration or termination of air service agreements depending on the nature of any such change the value of the company’s international route authorities and slot rights may be materially enhanced or diminished 

the useu open skies agreement provides us and eu carriers with expansive rights including the right to operate between any point in the united states and the eu the agreement has no direct impact on airport slot rights or airport facilities nor does it provide for a reallocation of existing slots or facilities including those at london heathrow because of the diverse nature of potential impacts on the company’s business the overall future impact of the useu agreement on the company’s business cannot be predicted with certainty 

in october 2010 the open skies agreement between the united states and japan became effective enabling us or japanese carriers to fly between any point in the united states and any point in japan and in the case of us carriers beyond japan to points in other countries the carrier is authorized to serve the agreement eliminates the restrictions on the number of frequencies carriers can operate and requires governments in both the united states and japan to concur before taking action to regulate a carrier’s fares or rates 

environmental regulation 

general the airline industry is subject to increasingly stringent federal state local and international environmental laws and regulations concerning emissions to the air discharges to surface and subsurface waters safe drinking water aircraft noise and the management of hazardous substances oils and waste materials areas of developing regulations include new regulations surrounding the emission of greenhouse gases discussed further below state of california rulemakings regarding air emissions from ground support equipment and a federal rulemaking concerning the discharge of deicing fluid 

climate change there are certain laws and regulations relating to climate change that apply to the company including the eu emissions trading scheme “ets” which is subject to legal challenge environmental taxes for certain international flights including the united kingdom’s air passenger duty and germany’s departure ticket tax limited greenhouse gas reporting requirements and the state of california’s cap and trade regulations which impacts united’s san francisco maintenance center and colocated cogeneration plant in addition there are landuse planning laws that could apply to airport expansion projects requiring a review of greenhouse gas emissions and could affect airlines in certain circumstances 

in 2009 the eu issued a directive to member states to include aviation in its greenhouse gas ets which required the company to begin monitoring emissions of carbon dioxide effective january 1 2010 beginning in 2012 the ets would require the company to ensure it has obtained sufficient emission allowances equal to the amount of carbon dioxide emissions from flights to and from eu member states with such allowances then surrendered on an annual basis to the government in december 2009 the air transportation association joined by united continental and american airlines filed a lawsuit in the united kingdom challenging regulations that transpose into uk law the eu ets as applied to us carriers in addition noneu countries are considering filing a formal challenge before the united nations’ international civil aviation organization “icao” with respect to the eu’s inclusion of noneu carriers if the scheme is found to be valid it could significantly increase the cost of carriers operating in the eu by requiring the purchase of carbon credits although the precise cost to the company is difficult to calculate with certainty due to a number of variables those potential costs will depend among other things on the baseline carbon emissions yet to be determined by the eu the company’s future carbon emissions from flights to and from the eu and the price of carbon credits 

  

in addition to current regulatory programs there is also the potential for additional climate change regulation in 2010 the administrator of the us environmental protection agency “epa” found that current and projected concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare although legal challenges have been initiated and legislative proposals are expected that may invalidate this endangerment finding andor the epa’s assertion of authority under the clean air act the finding could result in epa regulation of commercial aircraft emissions 

further the icao recently signaled through an icao assembly resolution that it will be developing a regulatory scheme for aviation greenhouse gas emissions there could be other regulatory actions taken in the future by the us government state governments within the us foreign governments or through a separate united nations global climate change treaty to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry which could result in multiple schemes applying to the same emissions the precise nature of any such requirements and their applicability to the company are difficult to predict but the financial impact to the company and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant including the potential for increased fuel costs carbon taxes or fees or a requirement to purchase carbon credits 

other environmental matters in addition the dot allows local airport authorities to implement procedures designed to abate special noise problems provided those procedures do not unreasonably interfere with interstate or foreign commerce or the national transportation system and do not conflict with federal law some us and foreign airports including airports located in certain of our hub cities have established airport restrictions to limit noise including restrictions on aircraft types to be used and limits on the number and scheduling of hourly or daily operations in some instances these restrictions have caused curtailments in services or increased operating costs and could limit our ability to expand our operations at the affected airports 

the airline industry is also subject to other environmental laws and regulations that require the company to remediate soil or groundwater to meet certain objectives and which may require significant expenditures under the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as “superfund” and similar environmental cleanup laws generators of waste materials and owners or operators of facilities can be subject to liability for investigation and remediation costs at locations that have been identified as requiring response actions the company also conducts voluntary environmental assessment and remediation actions environmental cleanup obligations can arise from among other circumstances the operation of aircraft fueling facilities and primarily involve airport sites future costs associated with these activities are currently not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company’s business 

  

employees 

as of december 31 2010 ual including its subsidiaries had approximately 86000 active employees approximately 72 of ual’s employees were represented by various us labor organizations as of december 31 2010 as of december 31 2010 united had approximately 46000 active employees and continental had approximately 40000 active employees the following table reflects the company’s employee groups number of employees per employee group representative union for each of united’s and continental’s employee groups and amendable date for each employee group’s collective bargaining agreement 

 

 collective bargaining agreements are negotiated under the rla which governs labor relations in the air transportation industry such agreements typically do not contain an expiration date and instead specify an amendable date upon which the contract is considered “open for amendment” contracts remain in effect while new agreements are negotiated during the negotiation period both the company and the negotiating union are required to maintain the status quo 

the process for integrating the labor groups of united and continental is governed by a combination of the rla the mccaskillbond amendment and where applicable the existing provisions of united’s and continental’s collective bargaining agreements and union policies under the rla the national mediation board “nmb” has exclusive authority to resolve union representation disputes arising out of airline mergers under the mccaskillbond amendment “fair and equitable” integration of seniority lists is required including arbitration where the interested parties cannot reach a consensual agreement pending operational integration the company will apply the terms of the existing collective bargaining agreements unless other terms have been negotiated 

  

  

united has been in negotiations for amended collective bargaining agreements with all of its unions since 2009 consistent with commitments contained in its current labor contracts united filed for mediation assistance in conjunction with four of its six unions alpa afa iam and pafca while the labor contract with the teamsters also contemplates filing for mediation the parties agreed to continue in direct negotiations the current contract with the ifpte does not stipulate filing for mediation 

in march 2010 continental reached a tentative agreement on a new fouryear labor contract with the union that represents its dispatchers which was ratified in april 2010 in september 2010 continental reached a tentative agreement on a new labor contract with the union that represents its aircraft maintenance technicians and related employees which was ratified in november 2010 continental negotiated a collective bargaining agreement with the teamsters covering its fleet service employees in november 2010 which was ratified in december 2010 in january 2011 continental reached a tentative agreement on a new labor contract with the union that represents its flight attendants the agreement is scheduled for a ratification vote the results of which are expected to be announced on or around february 26 2011 

after the company’s may 2010 merger announcement alpa opted to suspend negotiations at both united and continental to focus on joint negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement that would apply to the combined company in july 2010 united and continental reached agreement with alpa on a transition and process agreement that provides a framework for conducting pilot operations for the two employee groups until the parties reach agreement on a joint collective bargaining agreement and the carriers obtain a single operating certificate in august 2010 united and continental began joint negotiations with alpa and those negotiations are presently ongoing in december 2010 alpa and the company jointly applied to the nmb for mediation assistance for pilots and flight instructors 

in january 2011 the iam filed an application seeking singlecarrier findings by the nmb for purposes of union representation covering fleet service employees at continental and ramp service employees at united also in january 2011 the afa announced that it had filed a similar request with the nmb for purposes of union representation for united and continental flight attendants the company anticipates that other applications will be filed by various unions covering smaller groups of employees if the nmb determines that united and continental are considered a single carrier the relevant employees may vote with respect to union representation until elections occur the incumbent unions will continue to represent those employee groups who are currently represented 

the outcome of these labor negotiations may materially impact the company’s future financial results however the company is unable at this time to assess the timing or magnitude of such impact if any 

 

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend the following risk factors should be read carefully when evaluating the company’s business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this report and other statements the company or its representatives make from time to time any of the following risks could materially adversely affect the company’s business operating results financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this report 

the merger may present certain material risks to the company’s business and operations 

the merger described in item 1 business may present certain risks to the company’s business and operations including among other things risks that 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 accordingly there can be no assurance that the merger will result in the realization of the full benefits of synergies innovation and operational efficiencies that we currently expect that these benefits will be achieved within the anticipated timeframe or that we will be able to fully and accurately measure any such synergies 

certain of the company’s financing agreements have covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on the company and its subsidiaries the company may be unable to continue to comply with the covenants in these agreements a failure to comply with these covenants could result in the accelerated maturity of debt obligations which could materially and adversely affect the company’s liquidity 

united’s amended and restated revolving credit term loan and guaranty agreement dated as of february 2 2007 the “amended credit facility” the indenture governing continental’s 675 senior secured notes due 2015 the “675 notes” and the indentures governing united’s 9875 senior secured notes due 2013 and 120 senior second lien notes due 2013 the “united senior notes” and together with the 675 notes the “senior notes” impose certain operating and financial covenants as applicable on the company on united and its material subsidiaries or on continental and its subsidiaries 

among other covenants the amended credit facility requires ual united and certain of united’s material subsidiaries who are guarantors under the amended credit facility to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash balance as defined in the amended credit facility of 10 billion at all times a minimum ratio of collateral value to debt obligations that may increase if a specified dollar value of the route collateral is released and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 15 to 10 for twelve month periods measured at the end of each calendar quarter 

among other covenants the indentures governing the senior notes require the issuer to maintain a minimum ratio of collateral value to debt obligations if the value of the collateral underlying that issuer’s senior notes declines such that the issuer no longer maintains the minimum required ratio of collateral value to debt obligations the issuer may be required to pay additional interest at the rate of 2 per annum provide additional collateral to secure the noteholders’ lien or repay a portion of the senior notes 

  

  

the company’s ability to comply with the covenants in the amended credit facility and the indentures governing the senior notes may be affected by events beyond its control including the overall industry revenue environment and the level of fuel costs and the company may be required to seek waivers or amendments of covenants repay all or a portion of the debt or find alternative sources of financing the company cannot provide assurance that such waivers amendments or alternative financing could be obtained or if obtained would be on terms acceptable to the company 

a breach of certain of the covenants or restrictions contained in the amended credit facility or indentures governing the senior notes could result in a default and a subsequent acceleration of the applicable debt obligations in addition the indentures governing the united senior notes contain a crossacceleration provision pursuant to which a default resulting in the acceleration of indebtedness under the amended credit facility would result in a default under such indentures a default under these indentures could allow holders of the united senior notes to accelerate the maturity of the obligations in these indentures 

see note 14 to the financial statements included in item 8 of this report for further discussion of our operating and financial covenants under certain of the company’s financing agreements 

the company may be unable to continue to comply with certain covenants in agreements with financial institutions that process customer credit card transactions which if not complied with could materially and adversely affect the company’s liquidity 

united and continental have agreements with financial institutions that process customer credit card transactions for the sale of air travel and other services under certain of united’s and continental’s credit card processing agreements the financial institutions either require or under certain circumstances have the right to require that united and continental maintain a reserve equal to a portion of advance ticket sales that have been processed by that financial institution but for which united and continental have not yet provided the air transportation referred to as “relevant advance ticket sales” 

united’s credit card processing agreement with paymentech and jpmorgan chase bank na “jpmorgan chase” contains a cash reserve requirement determined based on the amount of unrestricted cash held by united as defined under the amended credit facility if united’s unrestricted cash balance is at or more than 25 billion as of any calendar monthend measurement date its required reserve will remain at 25 million however if united’s unrestricted cash balance is less than 25 billion or certain lower minimum cash amounts its required reserve will increase to stated percentages of relevant advance ticket sales that could be significant based on united’s december 31 2010 unrestricted cash balance united was not required to provide cash collateral above the current 25 million reserve balance 

under united’s credit card processing agreement with american express in addition to certain other risk protections provided to american express united is required to provide reserves based primarily on its unrestricted cash balance and net current exposure as of any calendar monthend measurement date with united’s required reserves increasing to stated percentages of net current exposure that could be significant as united’s unrestricted cash balance falls below certain minimum cash amounts the agreement with american express permits united to provide certain replacement collateral in lieu of cash collateral as long as united’s unrestricted cash is above 135 billion such replacement collateral may be pledged for any amount of the required reserve up to the full amount thereof with the stated value of such collateral determined according to the agreement replacement collateral may be comprised of aircraft slots and routes real estate or other collateral as agreed between the parties based on united’s unrestricted cash balance at december 31 2010 united was not required to provide any reserves under this agreement 

continental’s credit card processing agreement with jpmorgan chase and affiliates of jpmorgan chase contains financial covenants that require among other things that continental post additional cash collateral if it fails to maintain 1 a minimum level of continental’s unrestricted cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 2 a minimum ratio of continental’s unrestricted cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments 

  

to current liabilities of 025 to 10 or 3 a minimum senior unsecured debt rating for continental of at least caa3 and ccc from moody’s and standard  poor’s respectively if a covenant trigger under the jpmorgan chase processing agreement results in continental’s posting additional collateral under that agreement continental will also be required to post additional collateral under its credit card processing agreement with american express that could be significant 

if continental’s unrestricted cash balance is at or more than 20 billion as of any calendar monthend measurement date its required reserve will remain at 25 million however if continental’s unrestricted cash balance is less than 20 billion or certain lower minimum cash amounts its required reserve will increase to stated percentages of relevant advance ticket sales that could be significant based on continental’s december 31 2010 unrestricted cash balance continental was not required to provide cash collateral above the current 25 million reserve balance 

an increase in the future reserve requirements and the posting of a significant amount of cash collateral as provided by the terms of any or all of united’s and continental’s material credit card processing agreements could materially reduce the company’s liquidity see note 17 to the financial statements included in item 8 of this report for a detailed discussion of our obligations under the company’s credit card processing agreements 

the company may not be able to maintain adequate liquidity 

the company has a significant amount of financial leverage from fixed obligations including aircraft lease and debt financings leases of airport property and other facilities and other material cash obligations in addition the company has substantial noncancelable commitments for capital expenditures including the acquisition of new aircraft and related spare engines while the company’s cash flows from operations and its available capital including the proceeds from financing transactions have been sufficient to meet these obligations and commitments to date the company’s future liquidity could be negatively impacted by the risk factors discussed in this item 1a including but not limited to substantial volatility in the price of fuel adverse economic conditions and disruptions in the global capital markets 

in the event that the company’s liquidity is constrained due to the factors noted above or otherwise the company’s failure to comply with certain financial covenants under its financing and credit card processing agreements timely pay its debts or comply with other material provisions of its contractual obligations could result in a variety of adverse consequences including the acceleration of the company’s indebtedness the increase of required reserves under credit card processing agreements the withholding of credit card sale proceeds by its credit card service providers and the exercise of other remedies by its creditors and equipment lessors that could result in material adverse effects on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

further certain of the company’s debt is secured by collateral and the company may have limited remaining assets available as collateral for loans or other indebtedness which may make it difficult to raise additional capital to meet its liquidity needs the company’s level of indebtedness noninvestment grade credit rating and the current market conditions may also make it difficult for the company to raise capital to meet its liquidity needs and may increase its cost of borrowing a higher cost of capital could negatively impact its results of operations financial position and liquidity 

see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further information regarding the company’s liquidity 

economic and industry conditions constantly change and unfavorable global economic conditions may have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations 

the company’s business and results of operations are significantly impacted by general economic and industry conditions the airline industry is highly cyclical and the level of demand for air travel is correlated to the strength of the us and global economies robust demand for our air transportation services depends largely 

  

on favorable general economic conditions including the strength of the global and local economies low unemployment levels strong consumer confidence levels and the availability of consumer and business credit for leisure travelers air transportation is often a discretionary purchase that those consumers can eliminate from their spending in difficult economic times in addition during periods of unfavorable economic conditions businesses usually reduce the volume of their business travel either due to costsavings initiatives or as a result of decreased business activity requiring travel 

the overall demand for air transportation in the united states significantly decreased in 2008 and 2009 due to the severe global economic recession and this decline in demand disproportionately reduced the volume of highyield traffic in the premium cabins on domestic and international flights as many business travelers either curtailed their travel or purchased lower yield economy tickets decreases in passenger and cargo demand that resulted in lower passenger volumes and lower ticket fares had a significant adverse impact on our results of operations in 2008 and 2009 while some economic indicators are beginning to exhibit growth other economic indicators that may reflect an economic recovery such as unemployment may not improve for an extended period of time in addition decreases in cargo revenues due to lower demand have a disproportionate impact on our operating results as our cargo revenues generally have higher margins as compared to our passenger revenues stagnant or worsening global economic conditions that contribute to reduced passenger and cargo revenues may have a material adverse effect on the company’s revenues results of operations and liquidity 

in addition to its effect on demand for our services the global economic recession severely disrupted the global capital markets resulting in a diminished availability of financing and a higher cost for financing that was obtainable although access to the capital markets has improved if economic conditions again worsen or these markets experience further disruptions we may be unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all to refinance certain maturing debt and to satisfy future capital commitments 

continued periods of historically high fuel costs or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a material adverse impact on the company’s operating results 

expenditures for aircraft fuel and related taxes represent one of the largest single costs of operating the company’s business the company’s financial condition and result of operations may be significantly impacted by the availability and price of aircraft fuel while the company arranges to have fuel shipped on major pipelines and stored close to its major hub locations to ensure supply continuity in the short term the company cannot predict the continued future availability of aircraft fuel 

at times due to the highly competitive nature of the airline industry the company has not been able to increase its fares or other fees sufficiently to offset increased fuel costs fuel prices continue to be volatile which may negatively impact the company’s liquidity in the future the company may not be able to increase its fares or other fees if fuel prices rise in the future and any such increases may not be sustainable in the highly competitive airline industry in addition any increases in fares or other fees may not sufficiently offset the fuel price increase and may reduce the demand for air travel 

the company enters into hedging arrangements to protect against rising fuel costs however the company’s hedging programs may use significant amounts of cash due to posting of cash collateral in some circumstances may not be successful in controlling fuel costs and may be limited due to market conditions and other factors in addition significant declines in fuel prices may increase the costs associated with the company’s fuel hedging arrangements to the extent it has entered into swaps or collars swaps and sold put options as part of a collar may obligate us to make payments to the counterparty upon settlement of the contracts if the price of the commodity hedged falls below the agreed upon amount declining crude and related oil prices may result in the company posting significant amounts of collateral to cover potential amounts owed beyond certain creditbased thresholds with respect to swap and collar contracts that have not yet settled also lower fuel prices may result in increased industry capacity and lower fares especially to the extent that reduced fuel costs justify increased utilization by airlines of less fuel efficient aircraft 

  

  

there can be no assurance that the company’s hedging arrangements will provide any particular level of protection against increases or declines in fuel costs or that its counterparties will be able to perform under the company’s hedging arrangements additionally deterioration in the company’s financial condition could negatively affect its ability to enter into new hedge contracts in the future and may potentially require the company to post increased amounts of collateral under its fuel hedging agreements 

see note 13 to the financial statements included in item 8 for additional information on the company’s hedging programs 

terrorist attacks or international hostilities or the fear of terrorist attacks or hostilities even if not made directly on the airline industry could negatively affect the company and the airline industry 

the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 involving commercial aircraft severely and adversely impacted each of united’s and continental’s financial condition and results of operations as well as the prospects for the airline industry among the effects experienced from the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks were substantial flight disruption costs caused by the faaimposed temporary grounding of the us airline industry’s fleet significantly increased security costs and associated passenger inconvenience increased insurance costs substantially higher ticket refunds and significantly decreased traffic and passenger revenue 

additional terrorist attacks even if not made directly on the airline industry or the fear of or the precautions taken in anticipation of such attacks including elevated national threat warnings or selective cancellation or redirection of flights could materially and adversely affect the company and the airline industry wars and other international hostilities could also have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition liquidity and results of operations the company’s financial resources might not be sufficient to absorb the adverse effects of any further terrorist attacks or other international hostilities involving the united states or us interests 

the airline industry is highly competitive and susceptible to price discounting and changes in capacity which could have a material adverse effect on the company 

the us airline industry is characterized by substantial price competition in recent years the market share held by lowcost carriers has increased significantly and is expected to continue to increase the increased market presence of lowcost carriers which engage in substantial price discounting has diminished the ability of large network carriers to exercise pricing power and maintain sufficient fare levels in domestic markets to achieve sustained profitability 

airlines also compete for market share by increasing or decreasing their capacity including route systems and the number of markets served several of the company’s domestic competitors have increased their international capacity by including service to some destinations that the company currently serves causing overlap in destinations served and therefore increasing competition for those destinations in addition the company and certain of its competitors have implemented significant capacity reductions in recent years in response to the global recession further certain of the company’s competitors may not reduce capacity or may increase capacity thereby diminishing the expected benefit to the company from capacity reductions this increased competition in both domestic and international markets may have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations financial condition or liquidity 

the airline industry may undergo further bankruptcy restructuring industry consolidation or the creation or modification of alliances or joint ventures any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company 

the company faces and may to continue to face strong competition from other carriers due to bankruptcy restructuring industry consolidation and the creation and modification of alliances and joint ventures a number of carriers have filed for bankruptcy protection in recent years and other domestic and international carriers could restructure in bankruptcy or threaten to do so in the future to reduce their costs carriers operating under 

  

bankruptcy protection can operate in a manner that could be adverse to the company and could emerge from bankruptcy as more vigorous competitors 

since 2008 the us airline industry has experienced consolidation through a number of mergers and acquisitions the company is also facing stronger competition from expanded airline alliances and joint ventures carriers entering into and participating in airline alliances andor joint ventures may also become strong competitors as they are able to coordinate routes pool revenues and costs and enjoy other mutual benefits achieving many of the benefits of consolidation “open skies” agreements including the agreements between the united states and the eu and between the united states and japan may also give rise to additional consolidation or better integration opportunities among international carriers 

there is ongoing speculation that further airline industry reorganizations or consolidations could occur in the future the company routinely engages in analysis and discussions regarding its own strategic position including alliances asset acquisitions and divestitures and business combinations and may have future discussions with other airlines regarding strategic activities if other airlines participate in such activities those airlines may significantly improve their cost structures or revenue generation capabilities thereby potentially making them stronger competitors of the company and potentially impairing the company’s ability to realize expected benefits from its own strategic relationships 

additional security requirements may increase the company’s costs and decrease its revenues and traffic 

since september 11 2001 the department of homeland security “dhs” and the transportation security administration have implemented numerous security measures that affect airline operations and costs including the presence of federal air marshals use of passenger data limitations on the content of carryon baggage expanded cargo and baggage screening and body scanning fingerprinting and photographing and are likely to implement additional measures in the future in addition foreign governments have also instituted additional security measures at foreign airports the company serves a substantial portion of the costs of these security measures is borne by the airlines and their passengers increasing the company’s costs andor reducing its revenue and traffic additional measures taken to enhance either passenger or cargo security procedures andor to recover associated costs in the future may increase the company’s costs andor decrease the demand for air travel and may result in related adverse effects on the company’s results of operations 

extensive government regulation could materially increase the company’s operating costs and restrict its ability to conduct its business 

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that result in significant costs and may have adverse effects laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges both domestically and internationally have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce airline revenue the company cannot provide any assurance that current laws and regulations or laws or regulations enacted in the future will not adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations 

each of united and continental operates under a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the dot if the dot altered amended modified suspended or revoked these certificates it could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business the faa from time to time also issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require material expenditures or operational restrictions by the company and which could include the temporary grounding of an entire aircraft type if the faa identifies design manufacturing maintenance or other issues requiring immediate corrective action faa requirements cover among other things retirement of older aircraft security measures collision avoidance systems airborne windshear avoidance systems noise abatement and other environmental concerns aircraft operation and safety and increased inspections and maintenance procedures to be conducted on older aircraft these faa directives or requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company 

  

  

in addition the company’s operations may be adversely impacted due to the existing antiquated air traffic control “atc” system utilized by the us government during peak travel periods in certain markets the current atc system’s inability to handle existing travel demand has led to shortterm capacity constraints imposed by government agencies and resulted in delays and disruptions of air traffic in addition the current system will not be able to effectively handle projected future air traffic growth imposition of these atc constraints on a longterm basis may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations failure to update the atc system in a timely manner and the substantial funding requirements of a modernized atc system that may be imposed on air carriers may have an adverse impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

the airline industry is subject to extensive federal state and local taxes and fees that increase the cost of the company’s operations in addition to taxes and fees that the company is currently subject to proposed taxes and fees are currently pending and if imposed would increase the company’s operating expenses 

access to landing and takeoff rights or “slots” at several major us airports and many foreign airports served by the company are or recently have been subject to government regulation certain of the company’s major hubs are among increasingly congested airports in the united states and have been or could be the subject of regulatory action that might limit the number of flights andor increase costs of operations at certain times or throughout the day the faa may limit the company’s airport access by limiting the number of departure and arrival slots at high density traffic airports which could affect the company’s ownership and transfer rights and local airport authorities may have the ability to control access to certain facilities or the cost of access to its facilities which could have an adverse effect on the company’s business in addition in 2008 the faa planned to withdraw and auction a certain number of slots held by airlines at the three primary new york area airports which the airlines challenged and the faa terminated in 2009 if the faa were to plan another auction that survived legal challenge by the airlines the company could incur substantial costs to obtain such slots further the company’s operating costs at airports at which it operates including the company’s major hubs may increase significantly because of capital improvements at such airports that the company may be required to fund directly or indirectly in some circumstances such costs could be imposed by the relevant airport authority without the company’s approval and may have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition 

the ability of us carriers to operate international routes is subject to change because the applicable arrangements between the united states and foreign governments may be amended from time to time or because appropriate slots or facilities may not be made available the company currently operates on a number of international routes under government arrangements that limit the number of carriers permitted to operate on the route the capacity of the carriers providing services on the route or the number of carriers allowed access to particular airports if an open skies policy were to be adopted for any of these routes such an event could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial position and results of operations and could result in the impairment of material amounts of related tangible and intangible assets in addition competition from revenuesharing joint ventures and other alliance arrangements by and among other airlines could impair the value of the company’s business and assets on the open skies routes 

the company’s plans to enter into or expand antitrust immunized joint ventures for various international regions are subject to receipt of approvals from applicable federal authorities or otherwise satisfying applicable regulatory requirements and there can be no assurance that such approvals will be granted or applicable regulatory requirements will be satisfied 

many aspects of the company’s operations are also subject to increasingly stringent federal state local and international laws protecting the environment future environmental regulatory developments such as climate change regulations in the united states and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in the airline industry there are certain climate change laws and regulations that have already gone into effect and that apply to the company including the eu ets subject to legal challenge the state of california’s cap 

  

and trade regulations environmental taxes for certain international flights limited greenhouse gas reporting requirements and landuse planning laws which could apply to airports and could affect airlines in certain circumstances in addition there is the potential for additional regulatory actions in regard to the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry the precise nature of future requirements and their applicability to the company are difficult to predict but the financial impact to the company and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant 

see item 1 business—industry regulation  above for further information on government regulation impacting the company 

the company’s results of operations fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors associated with the airline industry 

due to greater demand for air travel during the spring and summer months revenues in the airline industry in the second and third quarters of the year are generally stronger than revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year the company’s results of operations generally reflect this seasonality but have also been impacted by numerous other factors that are not necessarily seasonal including among others the imposition of excise and similar taxes extreme or severe weather air traffic control congestion geological events natural disasters changes in the competitive environment due to industry consolidation and other factors and general economic conditions as a result the company’s quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year and historical operating results in a quarterly or annual period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 

the company could experience adverse publicity harm to its brand reduced travel demand and potential tort liability as a result of an accident or other catastrophe involving its aircraft the aircraft of its regional carriers or the aircraft of its codeshare partners which may result in a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial position 

an accident or catastrophe involving an aircraft that the company operates or an aircraft that is operated by a codeshare partner or one of the company’s regional carriers could have a material adverse effect on the company if such accident created a public perception that the company’s operations or the operations of its codeshare partners or regional carriers are less safe or reliable than other airlines such public perception could in turn cause harm to the company’s brand and reduce travel demand on the company’s flights or the flights or its codeshare partners or regional carriers in addition any such accident could expose the company to significant tort liability although the company currently maintains liability insurance in amounts and of the type the company believes to be consistent with industry practice to cover damages arising from any such accident and the company’s codeshare partners and regional carriers carry similar insurance and generally indemnify the company for their operations if the company’s liability exceeds the applicable policy limits or the ability of another carrier to indemnify it the company could incur substantial losses from an accident which may result in a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial position 

ual’s obligations for funding continental’s defined benefit pension plans are affected by factors beyond ual’s control 

continental has defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its us employees other than the employees of its chelsea food services division and continental micronesia inc the timing and amount of ual’s funding requirements under continental’s plans depend upon a number of factors including labor negotiations with the applicable employee groups and changes to pension plan benefits as well as factors outside of ual’s control such as the number of applicable retiring employees asset returns interest rates and changes in pension laws changes to these and other factors that can significantly increase ual’s funding requirements such as its liquidity requirements could have a material adverse effect on ual’s financial condition 

  

the company may never realize the full value of its intangible assets or our longlived assets causing it to record impairments that may negatively affect its results of operations 

in accordance with applicable accounting standards the company is required to test its indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis on october 1 of each year or more frequently if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred in addition the company is required to test certain of its other assets for impairment if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred 

during the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 the company performed impairment tests of certain intangible assets and certain longlived assets principally aircraft related spare engines and spare parts the interim impairment tests were due to events and changes in circumstances that indicated an impairment might have occurred certain of the factors deemed by management to have indicated that impairments may have occurred include a significant decrease in actual and forecasted revenues record high fuel prices significant losses a weak us economy and changes in the planned use of assets as a result of the impairment testing the company recorded significant impairment charges as described in note 4 to the financial statements included in item 8 the company may be required to recognize additional impairments in the future due to among other factors extreme fuel price volatility tight credit markets a decline in the fair value of certain tangible or intangible assets unfavorable trends in historical or forecasted results of operations and cash flows and the uncertain economic environment as well as other uncertainties the company can provide no assurance that a material impairment charge of tangible or intangible assets will not occur in a future period the value of our aircraft could be impacted in future periods by changes in supply and demand for these aircraft such changes in supply and demand for certain aircraft types could result from grounding of aircraft by the company or other carriers an impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

union disputes employee strikes or slowdowns and other laborrelated disruptions as well as the integration of the united and continental workforces in connection with the merger present the potential for a delay in achieving expected merger synergies increased labor costs or additional labor disputes that could adversely affect the company’s operations and impair its financial performance 

united and continental are both highly unionized companies as of december 31 2010 ual and its subsidiaries had approximately 86000 active employees of whom approximately 72 were represented by various us labor organizations the successful integration of united and continental and achievement of the anticipated benefits of the combination depend in part on integrating united and continental employee groups and maintaining productive employee relations failure to do so presents the potential for delays in achieving expected merger synergies increased labor costs and labor disputes that could adversely affect our operations 

in order to fully integrate the premerger represented employee groups the company must negotiate a joint collective bargaining agreement covering each combined group the process for integrating the labor groups of united and continental is governed by a combination of the rla the mccaskillbond amendment and where applicable the existing provisions of each company’s collective bargaining agreements and union policy pending operational integration the company will apply the terms of the existing collective bargaining agreements unless other terms have been negotiated under the mccaskillbond amendment  seniority integration must be accomplished in a “fair and equitable” manner consistent with the process set forth in the alleghenymohawk labor protective provisions or internal union merger policies if applicable employee dissatisfaction with the results of the seniority integration may lead to litigation that in some cases can delay implementation of the integrated seniority list the national mediation board has exclusive authority to resolve representation disputes arising out of airline mergers 

following announcement of the merger alpa which represents pilots at both carriers opted to pursue negotiations with the company for a joint collective bargaining agreement “jcba” that would govern the combined pilot group in july 2010 united and continental reached agreement with alpa on a transition and process agreement that provides a framework for conducting pilot operations of the two groups until the parties 

  

reach agreement on a jcba and the carriers obtain a single operating certificate in august 2010 united and continental began joint negotiations with alpa and the negotiations are presently ongoing 

the company can provide no assurance that a successful or timely resolution of labor negotiations for all amendable agreements will be achieved there is a risk that unions or individual employees might pursue judicial or arbitral claims arising out of changes implemented as a result of the merger there is also a possibility that employees or unions could engage in job actions such as slowdowns worktorule campaigns sickouts or other actions designed to disrupt united’s and continental’s normal operations in an attempt to pressure the companies in collective bargaining negotiations although the rla makes such actions unlawful until the parties have been lawfully released to selfhelp and united and continental can seek injunctive relief against premature selfhelp such actions can cause significant harm even if ultimately enjoined in 2008 united obtained a preliminary injunction preventing united’s pilots from engaging in any actions designed to disrupt united’s normal operations as a result of an agreement between the parties the preliminary injunction will remain in place until united and alpa have negotiated a new collective bargaining agreement 

increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage may materially and adversely impact the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 led to a significant increase in insurance premiums and a decrease in the insurance coverage available to commercial airlines accordingly the company’s insurance costs increased significantly and its ability to continue to obtain certain types of insurance remains uncertain the company has obtained thirdparty war risk terrorism insurance through a special program administered by the faa resulting in lower premiums than if it had obtained this insurance in the commercial insurance market should the government discontinue this coverage obtaining comparable coverage from commercial underwriters could result in substantially higher premiums and more restrictive terms if it is available at all if the company is unable to obtain adequate war risk insurance its business could be materially and adversely affected 

if any of the company’s aircraft were to be involved in an accident or if the company’s property or operations were to be affected by a significant natural catastrophe or other event the company could be exposed to significant liability or loss if the company is unable to obtain sufficient insurance including aviation hull and liability insurance and property and business interruption coverage to cover such liabilities or losses whether due to insurance market conditions or otherwise its results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

the company relies heavily on technology and automated systems to operate its business and any significant failure or disruption of the technology or these systems could materially harm its business 

the company depends on automated systems and technology to operate its business including computerized airline reservation systems flight operations systems telecommunication systems and commercial websites including wwwunitedcom and wwwcontinentalcom united’s and continental’s websites and other automated systems must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic and deliver important flight and schedule information as well as process critical financial transactions these systems could suffer substantial or repeated disruptions due to events beyond the company’s control including natural disasters power failures terrorist attacks equipment or software failures computer viruses or hackers substantial or repeated website reservations systems or telecommunication systems failures could reduce the attractiveness of the company’s services versus its competitors materially impair its ability to market its services and operate its flights and could result in increased costs lost revenue and the loss or compromise of important data 

the company’s business relies extensively on thirdparty providers failure of these parties to perform as expected or interruptions in the company’s relationships with these providers or their provision of services to the company could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the company has engaged an increasing number of thirdparty service providers to perform a large number of functions that are integral to its business including regional operations operation of customer service call 

  

centers distribution and sale of airline seat inventory provision of information technology infrastructure and services provision of aircraft maintenance and repairs provision of various utilities and performance of aircraft fueling operations among other vital functions and services the company does not directly control these thirdparty providers although it does enter into agreements with many of them that define expected service performance any of these thirdparty providers however may materially fail to meet their service performance commitments to the company or agreements with such providers may be terminated for example flight reservations booked by customers and travel agents via thirdparty gdss may be affected by changes to the contract terms between the company and gds operators a failure to agree upon acceptable contract terms when these contracts expire or otherwise become subject to renegotiation which is scheduled to occur for some of these contracts later in 2011 or other disruptions in the business relationships between the company and gds operators may cause the carriers’ flight information to be limited or unavailable for display significantly increase fees for both the company and gds users and impair the company’s relationships with its customers and travel agents the failure of any of the company’s thirdparty service providers to adequately perform their service obligations or other interruptions of services may reduce the company’s revenues and increase its expenses or prevent the company from operating its flights and providing other services to its customers in addition the company’s business and financial performance could be materially harmed if its customers believe that its services are unreliable or unsatisfactory 

the company’s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income for us federal income tax purposes may be significantly limited due to various circumstances including certain possible future transactions involving the sale or issuance of ual common stock or if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels 

as of december 31 2010 ual reported consolidated federal net operating loss “nol” carryforwards of approximately 116 billion 

the company’s ability to use its nol carryforwards may be limited if it experiences an “ownership change” as defined in section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended “section 382” an ownership change generally occurs if certain stockholders increase their aggregate percentage ownership of a corporation’s stock by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest percentage ownership at any time during the testing period which is generally the threeyear period preceding any potential ownership change 

as of october 1 2010 ual corporation and continental each experienced an ownership change under section 382 in connection with the merger while these mergerrelated ownership changes are not expected to significantly limit the company’s use of its nol carryforwards in the carryforward period there is no assurance that the company will not experience a future ownership change under section 382 that may significantly limit or possibly eliminate its ability to use its nol carryforwards potential future transactions involving the sale or issuance of ual common stock including the exercise of conversion options under the terms of the company’s convertible debt repurchase of such debt with ual common stock issuance of ual common stock for cash and the acquisition or disposition of such stock by a stockholder owning 5 or more of ual common stock or a combination of such transactions may increase the possibility that the company will experience a future ownership change under section 382 under section 382 a future ownership change would subject the company to an annual limitation that applies to the amount of preownership change nols that may be used to offset postownership change taxable income this limitation is generally determined by multiplying the value of a corporation’s stock immediately before the ownership change by the applicable longterm taxexempt rate any unused annual limitation may subject to certain limits be carried over to later years and the limitation may under certain circumstances be increased by builtin gains in the assets held by such corporation at the time of the ownership change this limitation could cause the company’s us federal income taxes to be greater or to be paid earlier than they otherwise would be and could cause all or a portion of the company’s nol carryforwards to expire unused similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes the company’s ability to use its nol carryforwards will also depend on the amount of taxable income it generates in future periods its nol carryforwards may expire before the company can generate sufficient taxable income to use them in full 

  

ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation limits certain transfers of its stock which could have an effect on the market price of ual common stock 

to reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect on the company’s ability to use its nol carryforwards for federal income tax purposes ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains a 5 ownership limitation this limitation generally remains effective until february 1 2014 or until such later date as may be approved by the ual board of directors the “board of directors” in its sole discretion the limitation prohibits i an acquisition by a single stockholder of shares that results in that stockholder owning 5 or more of ual common stock and ii any acquisition or disposition of common stock by a stockholder that already owns 5 or more of ual common stock unless prior written approval is granted by the board of directors 

any transfer of common stock in violation of these restrictions will be void and will be treated as if such transfer never occurred this provision of ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation may impair or prevent a sale of common stock by a stockholder and adversely affect the price at which a stockholder can sell ual common stock in addition this limitation may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the company creating a perception that a change in control cannot occur or otherwise discouraging takeover attempts that some stockholders may consider beneficial which could also adversely affect the market price of the ual common stock the company cannot predict the effect that this provision in ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation may have on the market price of the ual common stock for additional information regarding the 5 ownership limitation please refer to ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation available on the company’s website 

the company is subject to economic and political instability and other risks of doing business globally 

the company is a global business with operations outside of the united states from which it derives approximately onethird of its operating revenues as measured and reported to the dot the company’s operations in asia europe latin america africa and the middle east are a vital part of its worldwide airline network volatile economic political and market conditions in these international regions may have a negative impact on the company’s operating results and its ability to achieve its business objectives in addition significant or volatile changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies and the imposition of exchange controls or other currency restrictions may have a material adverse impact upon the company’s liquidity revenues costs and operating results 

the company could be adversely affected by an outbreak of a disease or similar public health threats that affect travel behavior 

an outbreak of a disease that affects travel demand or travel behavior such as severe acute respiratory syndrome avian flu or h1n1 virus or other illness or travel restrictions or reduction in the demand for air travel caused by similar public health threats in the future could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

certain provisions of ual’s governance documents could discourage or delay changes of control or changes to the board of directors 

certain provisions of ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws together the “governance documents” may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the board of directors and may discourage takeover attempts that some of its stockholders may consider beneficial 

certain provisions of the governance documents may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if the board of directors determines that such changes in control are not in the best interests of ual and its stockholders these provisions of the governance documents are not intended to prevent a takeover but are intended to protect and maximize the value of ual’s stockholders’ interests while these provisions have the 

  

effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of ual to negotiate with the board of directors they could enable the board of directors to prevent a transaction that some or a majority of its stockholders might believe to be in their best interests and in that case may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

the issuance of ual’s 8 contingent senior notes could materially and adversely impact the company’s results of operations liquidity and financial position 

ual would be obligated under an indenture to issue to the pension benefit guarantee corporation “pbgc” up to 500 million aggregate principal amount of 8 contingent senior notes the “8 notes” if certain financial triggering events occur the 8 notes would be issued in up to eight equal tranches of 625 million with each tranche issued no later than 45 days following the end of any applicable fiscal year a triggering event occurs when ual’s ebitdar as defined in the pbgc indenture exceeds 35 billion over the prior twelve months ending june 30 or december 31 of any applicable fiscal year the twelvemonth measurement periods began with the fiscal year ended december 31 2009 and will end with the fiscal year ending december 31 2017 however if the issuance of a tranche would cause a default under any other securities then existing ual may satisfy its obligations with respect to such tranche by issuing ual common stock having a market value equal to 625 million each issued tranche will mature 15 years from its respective triggering event date with interest payable in cash in semiannual installments and will be callable at ual’s option at any time at par plus accrued and unpaid interest because continental’s ebitdar will be included in the calculation for periods subsequent to the closing of the merger the merger increases the likelihood that all or a portion of the 8 notes will be issued as well as the likelihood that the timing of any such issuances would be accelerated however because the issuance of the 8 notes is based upon future operating results we cannot predict the exact number and timing of any such issuances by the company the issuance of the 8 notes could adversely impact the company’s results of operations because of increased charges to earnings for the principal amount of the notes issued and increased interest expense related to the notes issuance of such notes could also materially and adversely impact the company’s liquidity due to increased cash required to meet interest and principal payments 

delays in scheduled aircraft deliveries may adversely affect the company’s ability to expand its capacity 

the company from time to time acquires additional aircraft to increase its domestic and international capacity when the level of demand for air travel supports such growth the company has contractual commitments to purchase aircraft that it currently believes is necessary for its capacity growth delays in aircraft deliveries under those contractual commitments may occur and the company has been and may in the future be adversely impacted by those delays if significant additional delays in the deliveries of new aircraft occur the company may be able to accomplish capacity increases only by making alternative arrangements to acquire the necessary aircraft if available and possibly on less financially favorable terms including higher ownership and operating costs 

the issuance of additional shares of ual’s capital stock including the issuance of common stock upon conversion of convertible notes and upon a noteholder’s exercise of its option to require ual to repurchase convertible notes could cause dilution to the interests of its existing stockholders 

ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes up to one billion shares of common stock in certain circumstances ual can issue shares of common stock without stockholder approval in addition the board of directors is authorized to issue up to 250 million shares of preferred stock without any action on the part of ual’s stockholders the board of directors also has the power without stockholder approval to set the terms of any series of shares of preferred stock that may be issued including voting rights conversion rights dividend rights preferences over ual’s common stock with respect to dividends or if ual liquidates dissolves or winds up its business and other terms if ual issues preferred stock in the future that has a preference over its common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon its liquidation dissolution or winding up or if ual issues preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of its common stock the rights of holders of its common stock or the market price of its common stock could be adversely affected 

  

ual is also authorized to issue without stockholder approval other securities convertible into either preferred stock or in certain circumstances common stock as of december 31 2010 ual had 17 billion of convertible debt outstanding holders of these securities may convert them into shares of ual common stock according to their terms in addition certain of ual’s notes include noteholder early redemption options if a noteholder exercises such option ual may elect to pay the repurchase price in cash shares of its common stock or a combination thereof if ual elects to pay the repurchase price in shares of its common stock ual is obligated to deliver a number of shares of common stock equal to the repurchase price divided by an average price of ual common stock for a 20consecutive trading day period see note 14 to the financial statements included in item 8 of this report for additional information related to these convertible notes the number of shares issued could be significant and such an issuance could cause significant dilution to the interests of its existing stockholders in addition if ual elects to pay the repurchase price in cash its liquidity could be adversely affected 

in the future ual may decide to raise additional capital through offerings of ual common stock securities convertible into ual common stock or exercise rights to acquire these securities or its common stock the issuance of additional shares of common stock including upon the conversion or repurchase of convertible debt could result in significant dilution of existing stockholders’ equity interests in ual issuances of substantial amounts of its common stock or the perception that such issuances could occur may adversely affect prevailing market prices for ual’s common stock and ual cannot predict the effect this dilution may have on the price of its common stock 

ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation limits voting rights of certain foreign persons 

ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation limits the total number of shares of equity securities held by persons who fail to qualify as a “citizen of the united states” as defined in section 40102a15 of title 49 of the united states code to no more than 249 of the aggregate votes of all outstanding equity securities of ual this restriction is applied pro rata among all holders of equity securities who fail to qualify as “citizens of the united states” based on the number of votes to which the underlying securities are entitled

 item 3 legal proceedings 

air cargopassenger surcharge investigations 

in february 2006 the european commission the “commission” and the united states department of justice the “doj” commenced an international investigation into what government officials described as a possible price fixing conspiracy relating to certain surcharges included in tariffs for carrying air cargo the doj issued a grand jury subpoena to united and the commission conducted an inspection at the company’s offices in frankfurt united is considered a source of information for the doj investigation not a target 

on december 18 2007 the commission issued a statement of objections to 26 companies including united the statement of objections presented evidence related to the utilization of fuel and security surcharges and the exchange of pricing information that the commission views as supporting the conclusion that an illegal pricefixing cartel had been in operation in the air cargo transportation industry after united provided written and oral responses disputing the commission’s allegations against it the commission dismissed united from its case on november 12 2010 on july 31 2008 state prosecutors in sao paulo brazil commenced criminal 

  

proceedings against eight individuals including united’s cargo manager for allegedly participating in cartel activity united is actively participating in the defense of those allegations on january 4 2010 the economic law secretariat of brazil issued its opinion recommending that civil penalties be assessed against all parties being investigated including united to the administrative counsel of economic defense “cade” which will make a determination on the matter united will vigorously defend itself before the cade on december 15 2008 the new zealand commerce commission issued notices of proceeding and statements of claim to 13 airlines including united united is vigorously defending these proceedings 

in addition to the government investigations united was initially named as a defendant along with other air cargo carriers in over ninety class action lawsuits alleging civil damages as a result of the purported air cargo pricing conspiracy those lawsuits were consolidated for pretrial activities in the united states federal court for the eastern district of new york on june 20 2006 united entered into an agreement with the majority of the private plaintiffs to dismiss united from the class action lawsuits in return for an agreement to cooperate with the plaintiffs’ factual investigation united is no longer a defendant in the consolidated civil lawsuit 

united is currently cooperating with all ongoing investigations and continues to analyze whether any potential liability may result from any of the investigating bodies based on its evaluation of all information currently available united has determined that no reserve for potential liability is required and will continue to defend itself against all allegations that it was aware of or participated in cartel activities however penalties for violation of competition laws can be substantial and an ultimate finding that united engaged in improper activity could have a material adverse impact on the company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations 

united injunction against alpa and four individual defendants for unlawful slowdown activity under the railway labor act 

on july 30 2008 united filed a lawsuit in the united states federal court for the northern district of illinois seeking a preliminary injunction against alpa and four individual pilot employees for unlawful concerted activity that was disrupting the company’s operations the court granted the preliminary injunction to united in november 2008 which was upheld by the us court of appeals for the seventh circuit alpa and united reached an agreement to discontinue the ongoing litigation over united’s motion for a permanent injunction and instead the preliminary injunction will remain in effect until the conclusion of the ongoing bargaining process for an amended collective bargaining agreement that began on april 9 2009 by reaching this agreement the parties are able to focus their efforts on the negotiations for the collective bargaining agreement nothing in this agreement precludes either party from reopening the permanent injunction litigation upon a 30 day notice or from seeking enforcement of the preliminary injunction itself 

eeoc claim under the americans with disabilities act 

on june 5 2009 the us equal employment opportunity commission “eeoc” filed a lawsuit on behalf of five named individuals and other similarly situated employees alleging that united’s reasonable accommodation policy for employees with medical restrictions does not comply with the requirements of the americans with disabilities act the eeoc maintains that qualified disabled employees should be placed into available open positions for which they are minimally qualified even if there are better qualified candidates for these positions under united’s accommodation policy employees who are medically restricted and who cannot be accommodated in their current position are given the opportunity to apply and compete for available positions if the medically restricted employee is similarly qualified to others who are competing for an open position under united’s policy the medically restricted employee will be given a preference for the position if however there are candidates that have superior qualifications competing for an open position then no preference will be given united successfully transferred the venue of the case to the united states federal court for the northern district of illinois where the case law is currently favorable to united’s position on november 22 2010 united filed a motion to dismiss the matter on february 3 2011 the court granted united’s motion to dismiss which may be appealed by the eeoc within 60 days 

  

litigation associated with september 11 2001 terrorism 

families of 94 victims of the september 11 terrorist attacks filed lawsuits asserting a variety of claims against the airline industry united and american airlines the “aviation defendants” as the two carriers whose flights were hijacked are the central focus of the litigation but a variety of additional parties including continental have been sued on a number of legal theories ranging from collective responsibility for airport screening and security systems that allegedly failed to prevent the attacks to faulty design and construction of the world trade center towers world trade center properties inc as lessee also filed claims against the aviation defendants and the port authority of new york and new jersey the “port authority” the owner of the world trade center for property and business interruption damages the port authority has also filed crossclaims against the aviation defendants in both the wrongful death litigation and for property damage sustained in the attacks the insurers of various tenants at the world trade center filed subrogation claims for damages as well by statute these matters were consolidated in the us district court for the southern district of new york and the aviation defendants’ exposure was capped at the limit of the liability coverage maintained by each carrier at the time of the attacks in the personal injury and wrongful death matters the parties have settled all but one of the claims in which settlement discussions continue and for which a trial has been set in june 2011 insurers for the aviation defendants reached a settlement with all of the subrogated insurers and most of the uninsured plaintiffs with property and business interruption claims which was approved by the court the court’s approval order has been appealed to the us court of appeals for the second circuit the us district court for the southern district of new york dismissed a claim for environmental cleanup damages filed by a neighboring property owner cedar  washington associates llc this dismissal order has also been appealed to the us court of appeals for the second circuit in the aggregate september 11 th claims are estimated to be well in excess of 10 billion the company anticipates that any liability it could ultimately face arising from the events of september 11 2001 could be significant but by statute will be limited to the amount of its insurance coverage 

travel agency litigation 

during the period between 1997 and 2001 continental and united each independently reduced or capped the base commissions paid to domestic travel agents and soon thereafter eliminated those base commissions these actions were similar to those taken by other air carriers continental and united are defendants along with several other air carriers in two lawsuits brought by travel agencies that purportedly opted out of a prior class action entitled sarah futch hall dba travel specialists v united air lines et al usdc eastern district of north carolina filed on june 21 2000 in which the defendant airlines prevailed on summary judgment that was upheld on appeal the two lawsuits against continental united and other major carriers allege violations of antitrust laws in reducing and ultimately eliminating the base commissions formerly paid to travel agents and seek unspecified money damages and certain injunctive relief under the clayton act and the sherman antitrust act the pending cases which involve a total of 90 travel agency plaintiffs are tam travel inc v delta air lines inc et al usdc northern district of california filed on april 9 2003 and swope travel agency et al v orbitz llc et al usdc eastern district of texas filed on june 5 2003 by order dated november 10 2003 these actions were transferred and consolidated for pretrial purposes by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation to the northern district of ohio on october 29 2007 the judge for the consolidated lawsuit dismissed the case for failure to meet the heightened pleading standards established earlier in 2007 by the us supreme court’s decision in bell atlantic corp v twombly  on october 2 2009 the us court of appeals for the sixth circuit affirmed the trial court’s dismissal of the case on december 18 2009 the plaintiffs’ request for rehearing by the us court of appeals for the sixth circuit en banc was denied on march 18 2010 the plaintiffs filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the us supreme court which was denied on january 10 2011 the plaintiffs in the swope lawsuit encompassing 43 travel agencies have also alleged that certain claims raised in their lawsuit were not in fact dismissed the trial court has not yet ruled on that issue in the consolidated lawsuit the company believes the plaintiffs’ claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend any continued action by the plaintiffs 

  

litigation related to the merger transaction 

following continental and ual’s announcement of the merger on may 2 2010 three class action lawsuits were filed against continental members of continental’s board of directors and ual in the texas district court for harris county the lawsuits purported to represent a class of continental stockholders opposed to the terms of the merger agreement the lawsuits made virtually identical allegations that the consideration to be received by continental’s stockholders in the merger was inadequate and that the members of continental’s board of directors breached their fiduciary duties by among other things approving the merger at an inadequate price under circumstances involving certain conflicts of interest the lawsuits also made virtually identical allegations that ual and continental aided and abetted the continental board of directors in the breach of their fiduciary duties to continental’s stockholders each lawsuit sought injunctive relief declaring that the merger agreement was in breach of the continental directors’ fiduciary duties enjoining continental and ual from proceeding with the merger unless continental implements procedures to obtain the highest possible price for its stockholders directing the continental board of directors to exercise its fiduciary duties in the best interest of continental’s stockholders and rescinding the merger agreement on may 24 2010 these three lawsuits were consolidated before a single judge 

on august 1 2010 the parties reached an agreement in principle regarding settlement of the action under the terms of the settlement the lawsuits will be dismissed with prejudice releasing all defendants from any and all claims relating to among other things the merger and any disclosures made in connection therewith in exchange for that release ual and continental provided additional disclosures requested by the plaintiffs in the action related to among other things the negotiations between continental and ual that resulted in the execution of the merger agreement the method by which the exchange ratio was determined the procedures used by ual’s and continental’s financial advisors in performing their financial analyses and certain investment banking fees paid to those advisors by ual and continental over the past two years the settlement will not affect any provision of the merger agreement or the form or amount of the consideration received by continental stockholders in the merger the defendants have denied and continue to deny any wrongdoing or liability with respect to all claims events and transactions complained of in the aforementioned actions or that they have engaged in any wrongdoing the defendants entered into the settlement to eliminate the uncertainty burden risk expense and distraction of further litigation on february 14 2011 the court entered final judgment and dismissed the case 

on june 29 2010 fortynine purported purchasers of airline tickets filed an antitrust lawsuit in the us district court for the northern district of california against continental and ual in connection with the merger the plaintiffs alleged that the merger may substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in the transportation of airline passengers in the united states and the transportation of airline passengers to and from the united states on international flights in violation of section 7 of the clayton act on august 9 2010 the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction pursuant to section 16 of the clayton act seeking to enjoin the merger on september 27 2010 the court denied the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction which allowed the merger to close after the closing of the merger the plaintiffs appealed the court’s ruling and moved for a “hold separate” order pending the appeal which was denied by the court the appeal remains pending 

environmental proceedings 

in 2001 the california regional water quality control board “crwqcb” mandated a field study of the area surrounding continental’s aircraft maintenance hangar in los angeles the study was completed in september 2001 and identified aircraft fuel and solvent contamination on and adjacent to this site in april 2005 continental began environmental remediation of aircraft fuel contamination surrounding its aircraft maintenance hangar pursuant to a workplan submitted to and approved by the crwqcb and its landlord the los angeles world airports additionally continental could be responsible for environmental remediation costs primarily related to solvent contamination on and near this site 

  

in 2009 the eu issued a directive to member states to include aviation in its greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme which required the company to begin monitoring emissions of carbon dioxide effective january 1 2010 beginning in 2012 the scheme would require the company to ensure it has obtained sufficient emission allowances equal to the amount of carbon dioxide emissions from flights to and from member states of the eu with such allowances then surrendered on an annual basis to the government on december 17 2009 the air transportation association joined by united continental and american airlines filed a lawsuit in the united kingdom’s high court of justice challenging regulations that transpose into uk law the eu emissions trading scheme as applied to us carriers as violating international law due to the extraterritorial reach of the scheme and as an improper tax in june 2010 the case was referred to the court of justice of the european union case c36610 and the parties filed their written observations with the court in november 2010 

other legal proceedings 

the company is involved in various other claims and legal actions involving passengers customers suppliers employees and government agencies arising in the ordinary course of business additionally from time to time the company becomes aware of potential noncompliance with applicable environmental regulations which have either been identified by the company through internal compliance programs such as its environmental compliance audits or through notice from a governmental entity in some instances these matters could potentially become the subject of an administrative or judicial proceeding and could potentially involve monetary sanctions after considering a number of factors including but not limited to the views of legal counsel the nature of contingencies to which the company is subject and prior experience management believes that the ultimate disposition of these contingencies will not materially affect its consolidated financial position or results of operations

2010 financial highlights 

 

  

   

 2010 operational highlights 

 

  

  

  

 outlook 

set forth below is a discussion of the principal matters that we believe could impact our financial and operating performance and cause our results of operations in future periods to differ materially from our historical operating results andor from our anticipated results of operations described in our forwardlooking statements in this report see item 1a risk factors  for further discussion of these and other factors that could affect us 

economic conditions the severe global economic recession significantly diminished the demand for air travel resulting in a difficult financial environment for us network carriers in 2008 and 2009 ual’s financial performance improved significantly in 2010 primarily as a result of improving global economic conditions although we continue to see indications that the airline industry is experiencing a recovery including strengthening demand and improving revenue we cannot predict whether the demand for air travel will continue to improve or the rate of such improvement worsening economic conditions resulting in diminished demand for air travel may impair our ability to sustain the profitability we achieved in 2010 

merger integration ual expects the merger to deliver 10 billion to 12 billion in net annual synergies on a runrate basis by 2013 including between 800 million and 900 million of incremental annual revenues in large part from expanded customer options resulting from the greater scope and scale of the network fleet optimization and additional international service enabled by a broader combined network ual expects to realize between 200 million and 300 million of net cost synergies on a runrate basis by 2013 in addition ual expects that approximately 25 of its gross synergies will be realized in 2011 

the company also expects to incur a significant amount of additional substantial mergerrelated expenses and charges there are many factors that could affect the total amount or the timing of those expenses and charges and many of the expenses and charges that will be incurred are by their nature uncertain and difficult to estimate accurately see note 1 and note 21 to the financial statements in item 8 and item 1a risk factors  for additional information 

  

since the closing of the merger the company has taken significant steps toward the operational integration of united and continental the company has begun to optimize the gauge and frequency of its fleet in order to meet travel demand and capitalize on its combined global network efficiently the introduction of new services to markets previously not served by either carrier allows the company to meet the passenger demand created through the larger more comprehensive network the company is also aligning revenue management and pricing systems as well as inventory management strategies allowing it to create new revenue opportunities and other efficiencies for the combined company in addition the company has begun to align its employee incentive programs including its ontime bonus perfect attendance and profit sharing programs 

during 2011 and into 2012 the company expects to continue to harmonize into the new united brand the products and services offered by its two carriers the harmonization will involve streamlined customer policies aligned checkin and boarding procedures migration to a single reservations system and linkage of loyalty program accounts until the introduction of a combined loyalty program for 2012 among other events the company continues to integrate its operations and by the end of the second quarter of 2011 expects to be colocated at more than 35 airports including all of its hubs by the end of 2011 the company expects to receive a single operating certificate for united and continental from the faa the company has begun the transition to selected information technology platforms that support its commercial and operational processes which is expected to take more than one year to complete 

fuel costs fuel costs were less volatile in 2010 as compared to recent years however prices increased significantly late in 2010 and in the first two months of 2011 ual’s average aircraft fuel price per gallon including related taxes and excluding hedge impact was 235 in 2010 as compared to 184 in 2009 if fuel prices rise significantly from their current levels we may be unable to raise fares or other fees sufficiently to fully offset our increased costs in addition high fuel prices may impair our ability to sustain the profitability we achieved in 2010 based on projected fuel consumption in 2011 a one dollar change in the price of a barrel of crude oil would change ual’s annual fuel expense by approximately 100 million assuming there are no changes to the crude oil to aircraft fuel refining margins and no impact from our fuel hedging program to protect against increases in the prices of fuel the company routinely hedges a portion of its future fuel requirements provided the hedges are expected to be cost effective see note 13 to the financial statements in item 8 for additional details regarding the company’s hedging activities 

additional revenuegenerating and cost saving measures we intend to offer additional goods and services relating to air travel a portion of which will come from the “unbundling” of our current product and a portion of which will come from future goods and services that we do not presently offer the revenues that we derive from these products and services which are generally referred to as ancillary revenues typically have higher margins than that of our core transportation services and are an important element of our strategy to sustain the profitability that we achieved in 2010 the “unbundling” of our current products and services permits our customers flexibility in selecting the products and services they wish to purchase an example of a new service that we have introduced is continental’s farelock introduced in december 2010 which is an option that offers customers the opportunity for a fee to hold reservations and lockin ticket prices for either 72 hours or seven days with no commitment to purchase a ticket 

additionally we expect to continue to invest in technology that is designed to both assist customers with selfservice and allow us to make better operational decisions while lowering our operating costs 

capacity we announced new service to several international destinations in 2010 including lagos nigeria cairo egypt and auckland new zealand we do not anticipate significant capacity growth in 2011 unless the level of demand for air travel economic conditions and the expected financial benefit sufficiently justify such growth we expect only modest capacity growth for 2011 with both our mainline and consolidated capacity increasing between 10 and 20 we expect consolidated domestic capacity to decrease between 05 and 15 and consolidated international capacity to increase between 45 and 55 should fuel prices increase significantly we would likely adjust our capacity plans downward 

  

our future ability to grow or improve our efficiency could be adversely impacted by manufacturer delays in aircraft deliveries we have not received a revised 787 delivery schedule but we currently expect the first of our boeing 787 aircraft to be delivered in the first half of 2012 

labor costs   our ability to achieve and sustain profitability also depends on continuing our efforts to implement and maintain a more competitive cost structure as of december 31 2010 united and continental had approximately 82 and 60 respectively of employees represented by unions all of united’s unionrepresented employees and 53 of continental’s unionrepresented employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are currently amendable we are in the process of negotiating amended collective bargaining agreements with our employee groups the company cannot predict the outcome of negotiations with its unionized employee groups although significant increases in the pay and benefits resulting from new collective bargaining agreements could have an adverse financial impact on the company see note 17 to the financial statements in item 8 and item 1 business  for additional information 

results of operations 

to provide a more meaningful comparison of ual’s 2010 financial performance to 2009 we have quantified the increases relating to our operating results that are due to continental operations after the merger closing date the increases due to the merger presented in the tables below represent actual continental results for the fourth quarter of 2010 the discussion of ual’s results excludes the impact of continental’s results in the fourth quarter of 2010 intercompany transactions were immaterial 

operating revenues 

2010 compared to 2009 

the table below illustrates the yearoveryear percentage change in ual’s operating revenues for the years ended december 31 in millions except percentage changes 

 

   

the table below presents ual’s passenger revenues and selected operating data based on geographic region 

 

  

 excluding the impact of the merger consolidated passenger revenue in 2010 increased approximately 29 billion or 21 as compared to 2009 these increases were due to increases of 190 and 161 in average fare and yield respectively over the same period as a result of strengthening economic conditions and industry capacity discipline an increase in volume in 2010 as measured by passenger volume also contributed to the increase in revenues in 2010 as compared to 2009 the revenue improvement in 2010 was also driven by the return of business and international premium cabin passengers whose higher ticket prices combined to increase average fares and yields the international regions in particular had the largest increases in demand with international passenger revenue per asm increasing 299 on a 18 increase in capacity passenger revenue in 2010 included approximately 250 million of additional revenue due to changes in the company’s estimate and methodology related to loyalty program accounting as noted in critical accounting policies below 

excluding the impact of the merger cargo revenue increased by 177 million or 33 in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to improved economic conditions resulting in improved traffic and yield ual’s freight ton miles improved by 221 in 2010 as compared to 2009 while mail ton miles dropped approximately 88 during the same period for a composite cargo traffic gain of 183 freight yields in 2010 were 150 better than in 2009 due to stronger freight traffic reduced industry capacity and numerous tactical rate recovery initiatives particularly in ual’s pacific markets on a composite basis cargo yield in 2010 increased 126 as compared to 2009 

excluding the impact of the merger other operating revenue was up 14 in 2010 as compared to 2009 which was primarily due to growth in ancillary passengerrelated charges such as baggage fees 

2009 compared to 2008 

the table below illustrates the yearoveryear percentage change in ual’s operating revenues for the years ended december 31 in millions except percentage changes 

 

   

the table below presents ual’s passenger revenues and selected operating data based on geographic region 

 

 consistent with the rest of the airline industry ual’s decline in prasm was partially driven by a precipitous decline in worldwide travel demand as a result of the severe global recession two key factors had a distinct impact on ual’s revenue during 2009 first network composition played a role in overall unit revenue decline international markets in particular the pacific region experienced more significant unit revenue declines as compared to the other regions given ual’s significant international network and its historic relative contribution to passenger revenue ual’s revenue was significantly impacted by the contraction in travel demand in the pacific second while demand generally declined across all geographic regions premium and business demand declined more significantly than leisure demand as ual’s business model is strongly aligned to serve premium and business travelers both internationally and domestically the decrease in travel by business travelers and the buydown from premium class to economy class by some business travelers caused a significant negative impact on ual’s results in 2009 

in 2009 consolidated yield decreased 147 as compared to 2008 while consolidated average fare per passenger decreased 154 in the same period the yield and average fare decreases were primarily a result of the weak economic environment in 2009 and the resulting adverse economic impacts on ual as discussed above consolidated revenue was also negatively impacted by lower volumes of traffic due to the effects of the severe global recession 

consolidated revenues were favorably impacted in 2009 by an adjustment of approximately 36 million related to certain tax accruals that were previously recorded as a reduction of revenue this adjustment was recorded as a result of new information received by ual related to these tax matters 

cargo revenue declined by 318 million or 37 in 2009 as compared to 2008 due to four key factors first united took significant steps to rationalize its capacity with reduced international capacity affecting a number of key cargo markets second as noted by industry statistical releases during 2009 virtually all carriers in the industry including united were sharply impacted by reduced air freight and mail volumes driven by lower recessionary demand with the resulting oversupply of cargo capacity putting pressure on industry pricing in nearly all markets some of the largest industry demand reductions occurred in the pacific cargo market where united has a greater cargo capacity as compared to the atlantic latin and domestic cargo markets third lower fuel costs in 2009 also reduced cargo revenue through lower fuel surcharges on cargo shipments as compared to 2008 when historically high fuel prices occurred finally united historically one of the largest carriers of us international mail was impacted by lower mail volumes and pricing beginning in third quarter of 2009 arising from us international mail deregulation the deregulation moved pricing from regulated rates set by the dot to marketbased pricing as a result of a competitive bidding process 

  

in 2009 the increase in other operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in ancillary passengerrelated revenues which includes baggage fees and other unbundled services for the full year of 2009 ancillary passengerrelated revenues totaled approximately 11 billion 

operating expenses 

2010 compared to 2009 

the table below includes data related to ual’s operating expenses for the year ended december 31 in millions except percentage changes 

 

 the increase in aircraft fuel expense was primarily attributable to increased market prices for fuel as shown in the table below which reflects the significant changes in aircraft fuel cost per gallon for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to the year ended december 31 2009 the 2010 amounts presented in the table below exclude the impact of continental’s results after the closing date of the merger see note 13 to the financial statements in item 8 for additional details regarding gains and losses from settled positions and unrealized gains and losses at the end of the period 

 

 excluding the impact of the merger salaries and related costs increased 297 million or 8 in 2010 as compared to 2009 the increase was primarily due to increased accruals for profit sharing and other annual incentive plans in 2010 ual’s accrual for profit sharing was 166 million expense for the plan was not accrued in 2009 as the profit sharing and other incentive plan payouts were not earned based on ual’s adjusted pretax losses 

excluding the impact of the merger regional capacity purchase expense increased 87 million or 6 in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in capacity in the same period 

  

excluding the impact of the merger distribution expenses increased 86 million or 13 in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in passenger revenue on higher traffic and yields driving increases in commissions credit card fees and gds fees 

excluding the impact of the merger aircraft rent expense decreased by 20 million or 6 in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily as a result of united’s retirement of its entire fleet of boeing 737 aircraft some of which were financed through operating leases this fleet retirement was completed during 2009 

mergerrelated costs and special charges 

the table below presents asset impairments mergerrelated costs and special items incurred by ual during the years ended december 31 in millions 

 

 see note 21 to the financial statements in item 8 for additional information related to special charges 

mergerrelated costs 

mergerrelated costs consist of charges related to the merger and include costs related to the planning and execution of the merger including costs for items such as financial advisor legal and other advisory fees also included in mergerrelated costs are salary and severance related costs that are primarily associated with administrative headcount reductions and compensation costs related to the merger mergerrelated costs also include integration costs costs to terminate certain service contracts that will not be used by the combined company costs to writeoff system assets that are no longer used or planned to be used by the combined company and payments to thirdparty consultants to assist with integration planning and organization design see notes 1 and 21 to the financial statements in item 8 for additional information 

asset impairments 

the aircraft impairments in 2010 and 2009 are primarily related to a decrease in the estimated market value of ual’s nonoperating boeing 737 and 747 aircraft in 2010 ual recorded a 29 million impairment 18 million net of taxes of its indefinitelived brazil routes due to an estimated decrease in the value of these routes as a result of the new open skies agreement 

during 2010 ual determined it overstated its deferred tax liabilities by approximately 64 million when it applied fresh start accounting upon its exit from bankruptcy in 2006 under applicable standards in 2008 this error would have been corrected with a decrease to goodwill which would have resulted in a decrease in the amount of ual’s 2008 goodwill impairment charge therefore ual corrected this overstatement in the fourth quarter of 2010 by reducing its deferred tax liabilities and recorded it as a goodwill impairment credit in its 

  

consolidated statement of operations the adjustment was not made to prior periods as ual does not believe the correction is material to the current or any prior period 

in 2009 ual recorded a 150 million intangible asset impairment 95 million net of taxes to decrease the value of united’s tradename which was primarily due to a decrease in estimated future revenues resulting from the weak economic environment and united’s capacity reductions among other factors 

in 2009 ual recorded special charges of 27 million related to the final settlement of the lax municipal bond litigation and 104 million primarily related to boeing 737 aircraft lease terminations 

during the fourth quarter of 2010 ual recorded 130 million to other operating expense 65 million each for united and continental due to revenue sharing obligations related to the transatlantic joint venture with lufthansa and air canada this expense relates to ual’s payments for the first nine months of 2010 prior to contract execution 

2009 compared to 2008 

ual’s mainline capacity decreased 97 in 2009 as compared to 2008 the capacity reduction had a significantly favorable impact on certain ual operating expenses as further described below the table below includes data related to ual’s operating expenses for the year ended december 31 in millions except percentage changes 

 

 the decrease in aircraft fuel expense was primarily attributable to decreased market prices for fuel as shown in the table below which reflects the significant changes in fuel cost per gallon in 2009 as compared to 2008 lower mainline fuel consumption due to the mainline capacity reductions also benefited mainline fuel expense in 2009 as compared to the prior year prior to april 1 2010 ual did not designate any of its fuel hedge contracts under applicable accounting standards therefore ual markedtomarket changes in the fair value of its contracts through fuel expense in the case of economic hedges and through nonoperating expense in the case of hedges that were not considered to be economic hedges the majority of the combined 11 billion of fuel hedge losses in 2008 was due to marktomarket losses on open fuel hedge contracts at december 31 2008 these contracts cash settled in 2009 these significant losses occurred because certain ual hedge instruments required payments by ual to the counterparty if fuel prices fell below specified floors or strike prices in the hedge contracts crude oil peaked at approximately 145 per barrel in july 2008 and subsequently fell to around 45 per barrel in december 2008 the hedge contract prices at which ual was required to make payments to its counterparties were well above 45 per barrel resulting in significant losses on the hedge contracts 

  

 salaries and related costs decreased 533 million or 12 in 2009 as compared to 2008 the decrease was primarily due to ual’s reduced workforce in 2009 compared to 2008 ual had approximately 43700 average fulltime equivalent employees for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 49600 for the year ended december 31 2008 a 73 million decrease in severance expense related to ual’s operational plans and a 92 million yearoveryear benefit due to changes in employee benefit expenses also contributed to the decrease in salaries and related costs salaries and related costs also decreased by 46 million due to ual’s success sharing program ual did not record any expense for this plan in 2009 partially offsetting these benefits were the impacts of average wage and benefit cost increases and a 38 million increase related to ontime performance bonuses paid to operations employee groups during 2009 which were not paid in 2008 

the increase in regional capacity purchase expense of 10 in 2009 as compared to 2008 is consistent with the 11 increase in regional capacity during the same period 

landing fees and other rent increased 57 million or 6 in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to higher rates 

during 2009 aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs decreased by 131 million or 12 as compared to the prior year primarily due to a lower volume of engine and airframe maintenance repairs as a result of united’s early retirement of 100 aircraft from its operating fleet and the timing of maintenance on other fleet types 

distribution expenses decreased 176 million or 21 in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to lower passenger revenues on lower traffic and yields driving reductions in commissions credit card fees and gds fees ual also implemented several operating cost savings programs for both commissions and gds fees which produced realized savings in 2009 

aircraft rent expense decreased by 63 million or 15 in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily as a result of ual’s retirement of its entire fleet of boeing 737 aircraft some of which were financed through operating leases 

ual’s other operating expenses decreased 376 million or 13 in 2009 as compared to 2008 this decrease was primarily due to cost savings initiatives and lower variable costs associated with a 97 decrease in mainline capacity in addition other operating expenses decreased due to a reduction in maintenance cost of sales which was due to lower sales of engine maintenance services 

asset impairments and special charges 

see operating expenses—2010 compared to 2009 above for a discussion of 2009 impairments and special items in 2008 ual performed impairment tests of its goodwill all intangible assets and certain of its longlived assets principally aircraft predelivery deposits aircraft and related spare engines and spare parts due to events and changes in circumstances that indicated an impairment might have occurred as a result of this impairment testing ual recorded asset impairment charges of 26 billion see critical accounting policies and note 4 to the financial statements in item 8 for additional information 

  

in addition lease termination and other charges of 25 million were recorded during 2008 which primarily relate to the accrual of future rents for the boeing 737 leased aircraft that were removed from service and charges associated with the return of certain of these aircraft to their lessors 

see note 21 to the financial statements in item 8 for further information regarding these special items 

nonoperating income expense 

2010 compared to 2009 

the following table illustrates the yearoveryear dollar and percentage changes in ual’s nonoperating income expense in millions except percentage changes 

 

 the increase in interest expense in 2010 as compared to 2009 excluding the merger impact was primarily due to higher interest rates on average debt outstanding in 2010 as compared to comparable rates on average debt outstanding in 2009 as certain of the company’s recent financings have terms with higher interest rates as compared to debt that has been repaid the higher interest rates were due to distressed capital markets and the company’s credit and liquidity outlook at the time of the financings 

in 2010 miscellaneous net included a gain of 21 million from the distribution to united of the remaining united series 20011 enhanced equipment trust certificate “eetc” assets upon repayment of the note obligations in addition miscellaneous net included 10 million of hedge ineffectiveness gains in 2010 on fuel hedge contracts that were designated as cash flow hedges as compared to 31 million of fuel hedge gains in 2009 the fuel hedge gains in 2009 resulted from hedge contracts that were not designated as cash flow hedges as further discussed below under 2009 compared to 2008 

2009 compared to 2008 

the following table illustrates the yearoveryear dollar and percentage changes in ual’s nonoperating income expense in millions except percentage changes 

 

   

nonoperating expenses decreased by 478 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 the decrease was primarily due to a 559 million improvement in net fuel hedge gains and losses partially offset by a 93 million decrease in interest income due to lower investment yields as a result of decreased market rates 

as described in the discussion of changes in aircraft fuel expense above prior to april 1 2010 ual did not designate any of its fuel hedges as cash flow hedges under applicable accounting standards ual had a significant amount of hedges that it did not consider economic hedges and classified the related hedge losses in miscellaneous nonoperating expense as noted above the significant losses in 2008 were due to significant fuel price declines below the contractual prices in ual’s fuel hedge portfolio that existed during and at the end of 2008 the company’s fuel derivative gain in 2009 was less significant compared to 2008 because the company did not have any significant derivative activity for hedges that are classified in miscellaneous net in 2009 other than settlement of contracts that existed at december 31 2008 and there was less fuel price volatility in 2009 as compared to 2008 see note 13 to the financial statements in item 8 for further information related to fuel hedges 

income taxes 

in 2010 ual recorded a tax benefit of 11 million related to the impairment of its brazil routes offset by 12 million of state and other income tax expense the tax benefits recorded in 2009 and 2008 are related to the impairment and sale of certain indefinitelived intangible assets partially offset by the impact of an increase in state tax rates excluding these items the effective tax rates differed from the federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to the following change in valuation allowance expenses that are not deductible for federal income tax purposes and state income taxes ual is required to provide a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities because management has concluded that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets ultimately will not be realized see note 8 to the financial statements in item 8 for additional information 

united and continental—results of operations—2010 compared to 2009 

during the fourth quarter of 2010 united and continental changed their classification of certain revenue and expense items historical amounts have been reclassified for comparability see note 1 to the financial statements in item 8 for additional information related to these reclassifications 

united’s and continental’s management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations have been abbreviated pursuant to general instruction i2a of form 10k 

united 

the following table presents information related to united’s results of operations in millions except percentage changes 

   

 united had a net income of 399 million in 2010 as compared to a net loss of 628 million in 2009 excluding the impact of the merger on ual’s results of operations united’s results of operations were consistent with the ual results discussed above prior to the merger united was ual’s only significant operating subsidiary as compared to 2009 united’s consolidated revenue increased 33 billion or 20 to 197 billion for the year ended december 31 2010 this increase was primarily due to improved economic conditions in 2010 which drove higher fares as discussed above in 2010 united increased consolidated capacity only by approximately 1 due to the weak economic conditions in 2009 and 2008 united’s increase in consolidated passenger volume was consistent with this increase in capacity 

united’s operating expenses increased approximately 22 billion in 2010 as compared to 2009 which was primarily due to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 united’s nonoperating expense increased 123 million or 24 in 2010 as compared to 2009 which was primarily due to the increased cost of debt financing as a result of distressed capital markets during 2008 and 

  

2009 united’s interest expense is consistent with ual’s interest expense excluding the merger impact discussed above except for approximately 21 million of interest expense in 2010 from ual’s 345 million of 6 senior convertible notes due 2029 that were not issued by united 

continental 

the table below presents the continental successor and predecessor periods in 2010 the combined presentation for the year ended december 31 2010 does not represent a gaap presentation management believes that the combined nongaap results provide a more meaningful comparison to the full year 2009 continental’s operating income and net income in the combined 2010 period were 698 million and 346 million respectively as compared to operating and net losses of 144 million and 282 million respectively in 2009 this improvement was largely due to the improvement in global economic conditions following the severe recession in 2009 consistent with the improvement in ual’s results described above 

 

 total revenues increased 14 in the combined 2010 period as compared to 2009 primarily due to higher passenger fares which were driven by improving global economic conditions and an increased demand for air travel 

in the combined 2010 period aircraft fuel expense increased 13 as compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in fuel prices fuel hedge losses were 9 million and 380 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively continental’s fuel purchase cost without hedge impacts increased approximately 27 in 2010 as compared to 2009 which is relatively consistent with ual’s unhedged cost of fuel summarized in the tables above 

salaries and related costs increased 6 in the combined 2010 period as compared to 2009 the significant factors contributing to the increase in 2010 were profit sharing and related taxes of 77 million variable incentive compensation and annual employee wage increases 

  

aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs decreased 11 in the combined 2010 period as compared to 2009 primarily due to the timing of maintenance events and savings from renegotiated rates on certain contracts 

continental’s depreciation and amortization expense increased in the combined 2010 period as compared to 2009 primarily due to increased expense in the successor period associated with recording continental’s assets at fair value as of the merger closing date 

distribution expenses increased 17 in the combined 2010 period as compared to 2009 which was primarily due to increases in ticket volumes and prices as some distribution expenses are pricebased and some are volumebased 

aircraft rent decreased 8 in the combined 2010 period as compared to 2009 primarily due to the amortization of a lease fair value adjustment which was recorded as part of acquisition accounting 

during the fourth quarter of 2010 continental recorded 65 million to other operating expense due to the revenue sharing obligations related to the transatlantic joint venture with lufthansa and air canada for the first three quarters of 2010 

mergerrelated costs and special charges in the combined 2010 period included 230 million of mergerrelated expenses due to costs associated with the merger and integration of united and continental as discussed above aircraftrelated charges of 89 million in 2009 included 31 million of noncash impairments on boeing 737300 and 737500 aircraft and related assets 39 million of other aircraftrelated charges and 19 million of losses related to subleasing regional jets see note 21 to the financial statements in item 8 for additional discussion of mergerrelated costs and special charges 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of december 31 2010 ual had 87 billion in unrestricted cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments which is 56 billion higher than at december 31 2009 primarily due to the merger impact at december 31 2010 ual also had 388 million of restricted cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments which is primarily collateral for estimated future workers’ compensation claims credit card processing contracts letters of credit and performance bonds we may be required to post significant additional cash collateral to meet such obligations in the future restricted cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2009 totaled 341 million united has a 255 million revolving commitment under its amended credit facility maturing in february 2012 of which 253 million and 254 million had been used for letters of credit as of december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively unless this facility is renewed or replaced these letters of credit will likely be replaced with cash collateral in addition under a separate agreement united had a 150 million unused line of credit as of december 31 2010 

as is the case with many of our principal competitors we have a high proportion of debt compared to our capital we have a significant amount of fixed obligations including debt aircraft leases and financings leases of airport property and other facilities and postretirement medical and pension obligations at december 31 2010 ual had approximately 154 billion of debt and capital lease obligations in addition we have substantial noncancelable commitments for capital expenditures including the acquisition of new aircraft and related spare engines 

as of december 31 2010 a substantial portion of the company’s assets principally aircraft spare engines aircraft spare parts route authorities and certain other intangible assets were pledged under various loan and other agreements see note 14 to the financial statements in item 8 for additional information on assets provided as collateral by the company the company has limited undrawn lines of credit and most of our otherwise readily financeable assets are encumbered the global economic recession severely disrupted the global capital 

  

markets resulting in a diminished availability of financing and a higher cost for financing that was obtainable although access to the capital markets has improved as evidenced by our recent financing transactions we cannot give any assurances that we will be able to obtain additional financing or otherwise access the capital markets in the future on acceptable terms or at all we must sustain our profitability andor access the capital markets to meet our significant longterm debt and capital lease obligations and future commitments for capital expenditures including the acquisition of aircraft and related spare engines 

the following is a discussion of ual’s sources and uses of cash from 2008 to 2010 as ual applied the acquisition method of accounting to the merger ual’s cash activities discussed below include continental activities only after october 1 2010 

cash flows from operating activities 

2010 compared to 2009 

ual’s cash from operating activities increased by 941 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 this yearoveryear increase was primarily due to increased cash from passenger and cargo services higher cash operating expenses including fuel distribution costs and interest expense partially offset the benefit from increased revenues net cash required for fuel increased in the 2010 period due to higher aircraft fuel prices as shown in the fuel expense table in results of operations—operating expenses—2010 compared to 2009  above operating cash flows in the 2009 period included the receipt of 160 million related to the future relocation of ual’s chicago o’hare cargo facility 

2009 compared to 2008 

ual’s cash from operating activities increased by 22 billion in 2009 as compared to 2008 this improvement was partly due to decreased cash required for aircraft fuel purchases as consolidated fuel purchase costs decreased by 41 billion in 2009 as compared to 2008 decreases in ual’s fuel hedge collateral requirements also provided operating cash of approximately 955 million in 2009 as compared to a use of cash of 965 million in 2008 in addition ual received 160 million during 2009 related to the future relocation of its chicago o’hare cargo facility 

these operating cash flow benefits were partially offset by a decrease in operating cash flow due to decreased revenues which decreased by 39 billion in 2009 in addition ual did not have a significant advance sale of miles in 2009 resulting in an unfavorable variance as compared to 2008 during which ual received 600 million from its advanced sale of miles and license agreement with its cobranded credit card partner as discussed below 

cash flows from investing activities 

2010 compared to 2009 

ual’s capital expenditures were 371 million and 317 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively included in ual’s capital expenditures are continental’s capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2010 in addition to cash capital expenditures ual’s asset additions include continental’s acquisition of three boeing 737 aircraft in the fourth quarter of 2010 the proceeds of the eetc financing in the fourth quarter of 2010 described below were directly issued to the aircraft manufacturers therefore these proceeds are not presented as capital expenditures and financing proceeds in the statements of consolidated cash flows ual limited its spending in both 2010 and 2009 by focusing its capital resources only on its highestvalue projects 

in 2009 united received 175 million from three saleleaseback agreements these transactions were accounted for as capital leases resulting in an increase to capital lease assets and capital lease obligations during 2009 

  

2009 compared to 2008 

the sale of 23 billion of shortterm investments throughout 2008 generated significant investing cash flows in 2008 as compared to 2009 as discussed below these investments were sold as part of ual’s shift to invest available cash into money market funds ual’s capital expenditures which included capitalized interest were 317 million and 475 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively capital expenditures decreased significantly in the 2009 period as compared to 2008 because the company acquired only one aircraft in 2009 as compared to ten aircraft acquired during 2008 the 2009 and 2008 aircraft acquisitions were completed pursuant to existing lease terms using prefunded lease deposits as described below in cash flows from financing activities below 

in 2009 united received 175 million from three saleleaseback agreements described above the 2008 period included proceeds of 274 million from one saleleaseback transaction other asset sales including airport slot sales generated proceeds of 77 million and 94 million during 2009 and 2008 respectively 

cash flows from financing activities 

significant financing events in 2010 were as follows 

 

  

  

  

 significant financing events in 2009 for ual and united were as follows 

 

  

  

   

 the proceeds from these transactions were partially offset by 984 million used for scheduled longterm debt and capital lease payments during 2009 as well as 49 million used for payment of various costs associated with the financing activities above 

2008 activity 

ual used 253 million for its special distribution to common stockholders united issued a 257 million dividend to ual for this distribution and 919 million for scheduled longterm debt and capital lease payments united used cash of 109 million in connection with an amendment to its amended credit facility as further discussed below in 2008 united acquired ten aircraft that were being operated under existing leases these aircraft were acquired pursuant to existing lease terms aircraft lease deposits of 155 million provided financing cash that was primarily utilized by united to make the final payments due under these lease obligations 

united completed a 241 million credit agreement secured by 26 of united’s currently owned and mortgaged airbus a319 and a320 aircraft borrowings under the agreement were at a variable interest rate based on the london interbank offered rate “libor” plus a margin the agreement requires periodic principal and interest payments through its final maturity in june 2019 united may not prepay the loan prior to july 2012 

united also entered into an 84 million loan agreement secured by three aircraft including two airbus a320 aircraft and one boeing 777 aircraft 

ual generated net proceeds of 107 million in 2008 related to the 200 million equity offering program described above in the 2009 financing activities 

see cash flows from investing activities above for a discussion of united’s 2008 saleleaseback transactions 

for additional information regarding these matters and other liquidity events see notes 5 14 and 15 to the financial statements in item 8 

credit ratings as of the filing date of this report ual united and continental had the following corporate credit ratings 

 

 these credit ratings are below investment grade levels downgrades from these rating levels among other things could restrict the availability andor increase the cost of future financing for the company 

other liquidity matters 

below is a summary of additional liquidity matters see the indicated notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in item 8 for additional details related to these and other matters affecting our liquidity and commitments 

  

 debt covenants certain of the company’s financing agreements impose certain operating and financial covenants as applicable on the company on united and its material subsidiaries or on continental and its subsidiaries among other covenants the amended credit facility requires ual united and certain of united’s material subsidiaries who are guarantors under the amended credit facility to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash balance as defined in the amended credit facility of 10 billion at all times a minimum ratio of collateral value to debt obligations that may increase if a specified dollar value of the route collateral is released and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 15 to 10 for twelve month periods measured at the end of each calendar quarter among other covenants the indentures governing the senior notes require the issuer to maintain a minimum ratio of collateral value to debt obligations if the value of the collateral underlying that issuer’s senior notes declines such that the issuer no longer maintains the minimum required ratio of collateral value to debt obligations the issuer may be required to pay additional interest at the rate of 2 per annum provide additional collateral to secure the noteholders’ lien or repay a portion of the senior notes a breach of certain of the covenants or restrictions contained in the amended credit facility or indentures governing the senior notes could result in a default and a subsequent acceleration of the applicable debt obligations in addition the indentures governing the united senior notes contain a crossacceleration provision pursuant to which a default resulting in the acceleration of indebtedness under the amended credit facility would result in a default under such indentures a default under the indentures governing the united senior notes could allow holders of the united senior notes to accelerate the maturity of the obligations in these agreements 

credit card processing agreements united and continental have agreements with financial institutions that process customer credit card transactions for the sale of air travel and other services under certain of united’s and continental’s credit card processing agreements the financial institutions either require or under certain circumstances have the right to require that united and continental maintain a reserve equal to a portion of advance ticket sales that have been processed by that financial institution but for which united and continental have not yet provided the air transportation 

as of december 31 2010 united and continental provided a reserve of 25 million each as required under their respective credit card processing agreements with jpmorgan chase and affiliates of jpmorgan chase additional reserves may be required under these or other credit card processing agreements of united or continental in certain circumstances such as decreases in credit ratings decreases in united’s or continental’s unrestricted cash balance below amounts required by the processing agreements or decreases in minimum ratios of unrestricted cash to current liabilities in addition in certain circumstances an increase in the future reserve requirements as provided by the terms of one or more of united’s and continental’s material credit card processing agreements could materially reduce the company’s liquidity see note 17 to the financial statements in item 8 for a detailed discussion of the obligations under the company’s credit card processing agreements 

capital commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements the company’s business is capital intensive requiring significant amounts of capital to fund the acquisition of assets particularly aircraft in the past the company has funded the acquisition of aircraft through outright purchase by issuing debt by entering into capital or operating leases or through vendor financings the company also often enters into longterm lease commitments with airports to ensure access to terminal cargo maintenance and other required facilities 

  

the table below provides a summary of ual’s material contractual obligations as of december 31 2010 in millions 

 

  

      contingencies 

contingent senior unsecured notes  ual would be obligated under an indenture to issue to the pbgc up to 500 million aggregate principal amount of 8 notes if certain financial triggering events occur the 8 notes would be issued to the pbgc in up to eight equal tranches of 625 million with each tranche issued no later than 45 days following the end of any applicable year a triggering event occurs when ual’s ebitdar as defined in the pbgc indenture exceeds 35 billion over the prior twelve months ending june 30 or december 31 of any applicable fiscal year the twelvemonth measurement periods will end with the fiscal year ending december 31 2017 in certain circumstances ual common stock may be issued in lieu of the issuance of the 8 notes a financial triggering event has not yet occurred under this indenture 

  

legal and environmental  the company has certain contingencies resulting from litigation and claims incident to the ordinary course of business management believes after considering a number of factors including but not limited to the information currently available the views of legal counsel the nature of contingencies to which the company is subject and prior experience that the ultimate disposition of the litigation and claims will not materially affect the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations the company records liabilities for legal and environmental claims when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable the amounts of these liabilities could increase or decrease in the near term based on revisions to estimates relating to the various claims 

many aspects of the company’s operations are subject to increasingly stringent federal state and local laws protecting the environment future environmental regulatory developments such as climate change regulations in the us and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in the airline industry there are certain laws and regulations relating to climate change that apply to the company including the eu emissions trading scheme “ets” which is subject to legal challenge environmental taxes for certain international flights including the united kingdom’s air passenger duty and germany’s departure ticket tax limited greenhouse gas reporting requirements and the state of california’s cap and trade regulations which impacts united’s san francisco maintenance center and colocated cogeneration plant in addition there are landbased planning laws that could apply to airport expansion projects requiring a review of greenhouse gas emissions and could affect airlines in certain circumstances 

in 2009 the eu issued a directive to member states to include aviation in its greenhouse gas ets which required the company to begin monitoring emissions of carbon dioxide effective january 1 2010 beginning in 2012 the ets would require the company to ensure it has obtained sufficient emission allowances equal to the amount of carbon dioxide emissions from flights to and from eu member states with such allowances then surrendered on an annual basis to the government in december 2009 the air transportation association joined by united continental and american airlines filed a lawsuit in the united kingdom challenging regulations that transpose into uk law the eu ets as applied to us carriers in addition noneu countries are considering filing a formal challenge before the united nations’ international civil aviation organization “icao” with respect to the eu’s inclusion of noneu carriers if the scheme is found to be valid it could significantly increase the cost of carriers operating in the eu by requiring the purchase of carbon credits although the precise cost to the company is difficult to calculate with certainty due to a number of variables those potential costs will depend among other things on the baseline carbon emissions yet to be determined by the eu the company’s future carbon emissions from flights to and from the eu and the price of carbon credits 

in addition to current regulatory programs there is also the potential for additional climate change regulation in 2010 the administrator of the us environmental protection agency “epa” found that current and projected concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare although legal challenges have been initiated and legislative proposals are expected that may invalidate this endangerment finding andor the epa’s assertion of authority under the clean air act the finding could result in epa regulation of commercial aircraft emissions 

in addition the icao recently signaled through an icao assembly resolution that it will be developing a regulatory scheme for aviation greenhouse gas emissions there could be other regulatory actions taken in the future by the us government state governments within the us foreign governments or through a separate united nations global climate change treaty to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry which could result in multiple schemes applying to the same emissions the precise nature of any such requirements and their applicability to the company are difficult to predict but the financial impact to the company and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant including the potential for increased fuel costs carbon taxes or fees or a requirement to purchase carbon credits 

the company believes that it will have no financial exposure for claims arising out of the events of september 11 2001 in light of the provisions of the air transportation safety and system stabilization act of 

  

2001 the resolution of the majority of the wrongful death and personal injury cases by settlement and the withdrawal of all related proofs of claim from ual corporation’s chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and the limitation of claimants’ recoveries to insurance proceeds 

other contingencies  united is a party to a multiyear technology services agreement and has engaged in discussions with the counterparty to amend or restructure certain performance obligations in the event that these discussions are not successful the counterparty may assert claims for damages the ultimate outcome of these discussions and the exact amount of the damages and costs if any to the company cannot be predicted with certainty at this time 

for further details on these and other matters see note 17 in item 8 

offbalance sheet arrangements an offbalance sheet arrangement is any transaction agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has 1 made guarantees 2 a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets 3 an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or 4 any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support or that engages in leasing hedging or research and development arrangements the company’s primary offbalance sheet arrangements include operating leases which are summarized in the contractual obligations table in capital commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements above and certain municipal bond obligations as discussed below in addition united has 253 million of letters of credit issued under its amended credit facility at december 31 2010 continental had letters of credit and performance bonds relating to various real estate customs and aircraft financing obligations at december 31 2010 in the amount of 73 million the continental letters of credit and performance bonds have expiration dates through december 2014 

certain municipalities have issued municipal bonds on behalf of each of united and continental to finance the construction of improvements at airportrelated facilities united and continental also each lease facilities at airports where municipal bonds funded at least some of the construction of airportrelated projects as of december 31 2010 united guaranteed interest and principal payments of 270 million in principal amount of denver international airport bonds “denver bonds” which are due in 2032 unless united elects not to extend its equipment and ground lease in which case the bonds are due in 2023 the outstanding bonds and related guarantee for denver are not recorded in united’s financial statements because the related lease agreement is accounted for as an operating lease with the associated rent expense recorded on a straightline basis over the expected lease term through 2032 the annual lease payments through 2023 and the final payment for the principal amount of the denver bonds are included in the operating lease payments in the contractual obligations table in capital commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements above 

as of december 31 2010 continental is the guarantor of approximately 17 billion in aggregate principal amount of taxexempt special facilities revenue bonds and interest thereon excluding the us airways contingent liability described below these bonds issued by various airport municipalities are payable solely from continental’s rentals paid under longterm agreements with the respective governing bodies the leasing arrangements associated with approximately 15 billion of these obligations are accounted for as operating leases and the leasing arrangements associated with approximately 190 million of these obligations are accounted for as capital leases 

continental is contingently liable for us airways’ obligations under a lease agreement between us airways and the port authority of new york and new jersey related to the east end terminal at laguardia these obligations include the payment of ground rentals to the port authority and the payment of other rentals in respect of the full amounts owed on special facilities revenue bonds issued by the port authority having an outstanding par amount of 95 million at december 31 2010 and a final scheduled maturity in 2015 if us airways defaults on these obligations continental would be obligated to cure the default and would have the right to occupy the terminal after us airways’ interest in the lease had been terminated 

  

increased cost provisions in the company’s financing transactions that include loans the company typically agrees to reimburse lenders for any reduced returns with respect to the loans due to any change in capital requirements and in the case of loans in which the interest rate is based on libor for certain other increased costs that the lenders incur in carrying these loans as a result of any change in law subject in most cases to certain mitigation obligations of the lenders at december 31 2010 ual had 33 billion of floating rate debt consisting of united’s 23 billion and continental’s 10 billion of floating rate debt and 483 million of fixed rate debt consisting of united’s 233 million and continental’s 250 million of fixed rate debt with remaining terms of up to ten years that are subject to these increased cost provisions in several financing transactions involving loans or leases from nonus entities with remaining terms of up to ten years and an aggregate carrying value of 37   billion consisting of united’s 26 billion and continental’s 11 billion of carrying value we bear the risk of any change in tax laws that would subject loan or lease payments thereunder to nonus entities to withholding taxes subject to customary exclusions 

fuel consortia the company participates in numerous fuel consortia with other carriers at major airports to reduce the costs of fuel distribution and storage interline agreements govern the rights and responsibilities of the consortia members and provide for the allocation of the overall costs to operate the consortia based on usage the consortia and in limited cases the participating carriers have entered into longterm agreements to lease certain airport fuel storage and distribution facilities that are typically financed through taxexempt bonds either special facilities lease revenue bonds or general airport revenue bonds issued by various local municipalities in general each consortium lease agreement requires the consortium to make lease payments in amounts sufficient to pay the maturing principal and interest payments on the bonds as of december 31 2010 approximately 12 billion principal amount of such bonds were secured by significant fuel facility leases in which ual participates as to which ual and each of the signatory airlines have provided indirect guarantees of the debt ual’s contingent exposure is approximately 276 million principal amount of such bonds based on its recent consortia participation as of december 31 2010 united’s and continental’s contingent exposure related to these bonds based on its recent consortia participation was approximately 212 million and 64 million respectively the company’s exposure could increase if the participation of other carriers decreases the guarantees will expire when the taxexempt bonds are paid in full which range from 2011 to 2040 the company did not record a liability at the time these indirect guarantees were made 

united and continental—cash flow activities—2010 compared to 2009 

united 

operating activities 

united’s cash from operating activities increased by 819 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 this yearoveryear increase was primarily due to increased cash from passenger and cargo services higher cash operating expenses including fuel distribution costs and interest expense partially offset the benefit from increased revenues net cash required for fuel increased in the 2010 period due to higher aircraft fuel prices operating cash flows in the 2009 period included the receipt of 160 million related to the future relocation of ual’s chicago o’hare cargo facility 

investing activities 

united’s capital expenditures were 318 million and 317 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively united limited its spending in both 2010 and 2009 by focusing its capital resources only on its highestvalue projects in 2009 united received 175 million from three saleleaseback agreements these transactions were accounted for as capital leases resulting in an increase to capital lease assets and capital lease obligations during 2009 

financing activities 

united’s significant financing activities in 2010 and 2009 are described in cash flows from financing activities above in this item 7 

  

continental 

operating activities 

continental’s cash from operating activities increased by 10 billion in the combined 2010 period as compared to 2009 this yearoveryear increase was primarily due to increased cash from passenger and cargo services higher cash operating expenses including fuel and distribution costs partially offset the benefit from increased revenues 

investing activities 

continental’s capital expenditures were 300 million and 381 million in 2010 and 2009 respectively in addition continental acquired aircraft in both 2010 and 2009 with proceeds from financings that were delivered directly to the manufacturer see note 18 to the financial statements in item 8 for information related to these noncash financing and investing activities 

in the combined 2010 period cash used for purchases of shortterm investments was 273 million as compared to cash provided from sales of shortterm investments of 180 million in 2009 this yearoveryear variance was primarily due to investment of higher cash balances 

financing activities 

significant financing activities in 2010 and 2009 included the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 critical accounting policies 

critical accounting policies are defined as those that are affected by significant judgments and uncertainties which potentially could result in materially different accounting under different assumptions and conditions the company has prepared the financial statements in conformity with gaap which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements actual results could differ 

  

from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions the company has identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of the financial statements 

passenger revenue recognition the value of unused passenger tickets and miscellaneous charge orders “mcos” is included in current liabilities as advance ticket sales the company records passenger ticket sales and tickets sold by other airlines for use on united and continental as passenger revenues when the transportation is provided or upon estimated breakage the company records an estimate of breakage revenue for tickets that will expire in twelve months without usage at departure date the company records an estimate of tickets that have been used but not recorded as revenue due to system processing errors as revenue in the month of sale based on historical results due to complex industry pricing structures refund and exchange policies and interline agreements with other airlines certain amounts are recognized as revenue using estimates both as to the timing of recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized these estimates are based on the evaluation of actual historical results 

tickets sold by other airlines are recorded at the estimated values to be billed to the other airlines nonrefundable tickets generally expire on the date of the intended flight unless the date is extended by notification from the customer on or before the intended flight date fees charged in association with changes or extensions to nonrefundable tickets are recorded as other revenue at the time the fee is collected change fees related to nonrefundable tickets are considered a separate transaction from the air transportation because they represent a charge for the company’s additional service to modify a previous sale therefore the pricing of the change fee and the initial customer reservation are separately determined and represent distinct earnings processes refundable tickets expire after one year mcos can be exchanged for a passenger ticket the company estimates the amount of mco breakage revenue based on historical experience 

see note 3 to the financial statements in item 8 for additional information related to accounting standards impacting revenue recognition that have been issued but not yet adopted by the company 

frequent flyer awards united and continental have loyalty programs to increase customer loyalty program participants earn mileage credits “miles” by flying on united continental and certain other participating airlines program participants can also earn miles through purchases from other nonairline partners that participate in the company’s loyalty programs we sell miles to these partners which include retail merchants credit card issuers hotels and car rental companies among others miles can be redeemed for free discounted or upgraded air travel and nontravel awards the company records its obligation for future award redemptions using a deferred revenue model 

in the case of the sale of air services the company recognizes a portion of the ticket sales as revenue when the air transportation occurs and defers a portion of the ticket sale that represents the fair value of the miles as described further below in the case of miles sold to third parties there are two revenue elements marketing and air transportation as described below 

marketingrelated element in addition to selling miles for future redemption the company may also provide marketing services with the sale of miles which depending on the particular customer may include advertising and branding services access to the program member list and other services the amount of revenue from the marketingrelated element is determined by subtracting the estimated fair value of the miles earned or future transportation element from the total proceeds the residual portion of the sales proceeds related to marketing activities is recorded as other operating revenue when earned 

air transportation element the company defers the portion of the sales proceeds that represents the estimated fair value of the air transportation and recognizes that amount as revenue when transportation is provided the fair value of the air transportation component is determined based upon the equivalent ticket value of similar company fares and amounts paid to other airlines for air transportation the initial revenue deferral is recorded as frequent flyer deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheets the revenue related to the air transportation component is recorded as passenger revenue 

  

the value of miles is estimated assuming redemptions on the company and other participating carriers in the loyalty programs and by estimating the relative proportions of awards to be redeemed by class of service within broad geographic regions of the company’s operations this estimate also includes the cost of redemption on other airlines and the cost of certain other awards the estimation of the fair value of each award mile requires the use of several significant assumptions for which significant management judgment is required for example management must estimate how many miles are projected to be redeemed on its airline versus on other airlines since the equivalent ticket value of miles redeemed on the company and on other carriers can vary greatly this assumption can materially affect the calculation of the weightedaverage ticket value from period to period management uses historical customer redemption patterns as the best single indicator of future redemption behavior in making its estimates but changes in customer redemption behavior to patterns which are not consistent with historical behavior may result in material changes to deferred revenue balances and to recognized revenue 

the company measures its deferred revenue obligation using all awarded and outstanding miles regardless of whether the customer has accumulated enough miles to redeem an award some of these sold and awarded miles will never be redeemed by program members which we refer to as “breakage” ual reviews its breakage estimates annually based upon the latest available information regarding redemption and expiration patterns prior to january 1 2010 ual and united recognized revenue related to expected expired miles over the estimated redemption period the company’s estimate of the expected expiration of miles requires significant management judgment current and future changes to expiration assumptions or to the expiration policy or to program rules and program redemption opportunities may result in material changes to the deferred revenue balance as well as recognized revenues from the programs for example various program rule differences exist between the united and continental programs one such difference is for the expiration of miles as under united’s program miles expire after eighteen months of inactivity whereas miles do not expire under continental’s program although continental’s program does not cancel accounts for inactivity continental records breakage revenue by estimating that a portion of the miles will never be redeemed based on statistical analysis of several years of sales and redemptions of miles 

during the first quarter of 2010 united obtained additional historical data previously unavailable which enabled it to refine its estimate of the amount of breakage in its population of miles this new data enables united to identify historical differences between certain of its breakage estimates and the amounts that have actually been experienced more accurately as a result united increased its estimate of the number of miles expected to expire in conjunction with this change in estimate united also adopted a change to the accounting methodology used to recognize breakage both the change in estimate and methodology have been applied prospectively effective january 1 2010 the new accounting method recognizes breakage as a component of the weighted average redemption rate on actual redemptions as compared to united’s prior method which recognized a pool of breakage dollars over an estimated redemption period united believes that this is a preferable change to the accounting methodology for breakage because breakage will be recognized as a component of the rate at which actual miles are redeemed 

ual and united estimate these changes increased passenger revenue by approximately 250 million or 121 per ual basic share 099 per ual diluted share in the year ended december 31 2010 

the following table summarizes information related to the company’s frequent flyer deferred revenue 

 

   

asset impairments during 2010 2009 and 2008 ual performed interim and annual impairment tests of its intangible assets including goodwill and certain of its longlived assets principally aircraft and related spare engines and spare parts ual tested its indefinite lived intangible assets including goodwill on an annual basis in addition ual performed additional tests due to events and changes in circumstances that indicated an impairment might have occurred certain factors deemed by management to have constituted a potential impairment triggering event were a significant decline in actual and forecasted revenues the planned removal from ual’s fleet of 100 aircraft and a significant decrease in the fair value of ual’s outstanding equity and debt securities including a decline in ual’s market capitalization to significantly below book value among others 

ual recorded impairment charges of 165 million 243 million and 26 billion during the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively the impairment charge in 2008 included a 23 billion goodwill impairment 

discussed below is the methodology used for each type of asset impairment 

aircraft asset impairments 

all of ual’s aircraft impairments during 2010 2009 and 2008 were due to aircraft that were grounded or planned to be grounded or aircraft that were not operated by ual the aircraft impairments primarily related to united’s boeing 737 fleet which it completely removed from service and five of its boeing 747 aircraft which it removed from service as part of united’s capacity reduction plans which were initiated in 2008 fair value was estimated using the market approach asset appraisals published aircraft pricing guides and recent transactions for similar aircraft were considered by united in its market value determination several impairments of the boeing 737 and 747 aircraft occurred from 2008 to 2010 due to the weak economy and reduced demand for these particular aircraft among other factors 

in addition to the boeing 737 and 747 aircraft in 2009 ual tested five of its owned regional jets which were leased to a third party for impairment due to a weak market for these aircraft and a remaining lease term of approximately one year as a result of this testing ual recorded impairment charges of 19 million to record the regional aircraft at estimated fair value as of december 31 2009 

due to the unfavorable economic and industry factors described above ual also determined in 2008 that it was required to perform an impairment test of its 105 million of predelivery aircraft deposits and related capitalized interest ual determined that these aircraft deposits were completely impaired and wrote off their full carrying value as ual believed that it was highly unlikely that it would take these future aircraft deliveries and therefore united would be required to forfeit the deposits which were not transferable based on existing contract terms 

indefinitelived intangible assets 

ual performs an annual impairment test of its indefinitelived intangible assets on october 1 of each year and performs interim impairment tests of these assets throughout the year if events and changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment might have occurred 

in 2010 ual recorded a 29 million impairment of its brazil routes primarily due to the recent open skies agreement between the us and brazil which once enacted may result in a decrease in revenue from these routes the valuation of the brazil routes is based on an income methodology using estimated future cash flows from operation of the routes 

  

in 2009 using an income methodology which was based on estimated future cash flows united recorded impairment charges of 150 million to decrease the carrying value of its tradename the most significant impact on the estimated fair value was a significant decrease in actual and forecasted revenues due to the poor global economic conditions 

in 2008 ual recorded a 64 million impairment charge to indefinitelived intangible assets primarily codeshare agreements 

in 2008 ual estimated the fair value of the mainline reporting unit to which all goodwill is allocated utilizing several fair value measurement techniques including two market estimates and one income estimate and using relevant data available the market approach is a valuation technique in which fair value is estimated based on observed prices in actual transactions and on asking prices for similar assets the valuation process is essentially that of comparison and correlation between the subject asset and other similar assets the income approach is a technique in which fair value is estimated based on the cash flows that an asset could be expected to generate over its useful life including residual value cash flows these cash flows are discounted to their present value equivalents using a rate of return that accounts for the relative risk of not realizing the estimated annual cash flows and for the time value of money 

under the market approaches the fair value of the mainline reporting unit was estimated based upon the fair value of invested capital for ual as well as a separate comparison to revenue and ebitdar multiples for similar publicly traded companies in the airline industry the fair value estimates using both market approaches included a control premium similar to those observed for historical airline and transportation company market transactions 

under the income approach the fair value of the mainline reporting unit was estimated based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows for ual the income approach is dependent on a number of critical management assumptions including estimates of future capacity passenger yield traffic operating costs including fuel prices appropriate discount rates and other relevant assumptions the company estimated its future fuelrelated cash flows for the income approach based on the fiveyear forward curve for crude oil as of may 31 2008 the impacts of the company’s aircraft and other tangible and intangible asset impairments were considered in the fair value estimation of the mainline reporting unit 

taking into consideration an equal weighting of the two market estimates and the income estimate which has been ual’s practice when performing annual goodwill impairment tests the indicated fair value of the mainline reporting unit was less than its carrying value and therefore ual was required to perform additional goodwill impairment testing for this testing ual determined the implied fair value of goodwill of the mainline reporting unit by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of the mainline reporting unit including any recognized and unrecognized intangible assets as if the mainline reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the mainline reporting unit was the acquisition price as a result of this testing ual determined that goodwill was completely impaired and therefore recorded an impairment charge to writeoff the full value of goodwill 

accounting for longlived assets the net book value of operating property and equipment for ual was 169 billion and 98 billion at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively the assets’ recorded value is impacted by a number of accounting policy elections including the estimation of useful lives and residual values and when necessary the recognition of asset impairment charges 

the company records assets acquired including aircraft at acquisition cost depreciable life is determined through economic analysis such as reviewing existing fleet plans obtaining appraisals and comparing estimated lives to other airlines that operate similar fleets older generation aircraft are assigned lives that are generally consistent with the experience of united and continental and the practice of other airlines as aircraft technology has improved useful life has increased and the company has generally estimated the lives of those aircraft to be 

  

30 years residual values are estimated based on historical experience with regard to the sale of both aircraft and spare parts and are established in conjunction with the estimated useful lives of the related fleets residual values are based on current dollars when the aircraft are acquired and typically reflect asset values that have not reached the end of their physical life both depreciable lives and residual values are revised periodically to recognize changes in the company’s fleet plan and other relevant information a one year increase in the average depreciable life of ual’s flight equipment would reduce annual depreciation expense on flight equipment by approximately 36 million 

benefit accounting united’s obligations with respect to defined benefit pension plans were substantially eliminated in 2006 as most of the united defined benefit plans were assumed by the pbgc as part of ual corporation’s emergence from chapter 11 bankruptcy protection ual’s pension obligations increased significantly in 2010 due to ual’s assumption of continental obligations in the merger under applicable accounting guidance pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees’ approximate service periods ual only began recognizing the impact of continental’s plans in its financial statements beginning on october 1 2010 

ual’s plans’ underfunded status was 15 billion at december 31 2010 of which 14 billion is attributed to continental’s plans funding requirements for taxqualified defined benefit pension plans are determined by government regulations we estimate that our minimum funding requirements for the continental plans during calendar year 2011 is approximately 126 million the fair value of the plans’ assets was 19 billion at december 31 2010 of which 17 billion is attributed to assets of continental’s plans 

the following discussion relates only to the continental plans as the united plans are not significant to ual’s total obligations 

when calculating pension expense for 2011 continental assumed that its plans’ assets would generate a longterm rate of return of 775 the expected longterm rate of return assumption was developed based on historical experience and input from the trustee managing the plans’ assets   the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of assets which is based on a goal of earning the highest rate of return while maintaining risk at acceptable levels our projected longterm rate of return is slightly higher than some market indices due to the active management of our plans’ assets and is supported by the historical returns on our plans’ assets the plans strive to have assets sufficiently diversified so that adverse or unexpected results from one security class will not have an unduly detrimental impact on the entire portfolio we regularly review actual asset allocation and the pension plans’ investments are periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 

the defined benefit pension plans’ assets consist primarily of equity and fixedincome securities held through common collective trusts equity securities include investments in largecap and smallcap companies fixedincome securities include corporate bonds of companies in diversified industries and asset and mortgagebacked securities investments in equity securities and fixedincome securities are commingled funds valued at the unit of participation value of shares held by the plans’ trusts the private equity funds invest primarily in common stock of companies in diversified industries and in buyout venture capital and special situation funds investments in private equity funds are valued at the net asset value of shares held by the plans’ trusts at year end the allocation of assets was as follows at december 31 2010 

 

   

pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases when calculating pension expense for 2011 we will assume that our plans’ assets will generate a weightedaverage longterm rate of return of 775 lowering the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets by an additional 50 basis points from 775 to 725 would increase ual’s estimated 2011 pension expense by approximately 8 million 

future pension obligations for the continental plans were discounted using a weighted average rate of 552 at december 31 2010 ual determines the appropriate discount rate for each of its plans based on current rates on high quality corporate bonds that would generate the cash flow necessary to pay plan benefits when due this approach can result in different discount rates for different plans depending on each plan’s projected benefit payments the pension liability and future pension expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points from 552 to 502 would increase the pension liability at december 31 2010 by approximately 290   million and increase the estimated 2011 pension expense by approximately 36 million 

future changes in plan asset returns plan provisions assumed discount rates pension funding law and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future 

other postretirement benefit accounting united’s postretirement plan provides certain health care benefits primarily in the us to retirees and eligible dependents as well as certain life insurance benefits to certain retirees reflected as “other benefits” continental’s retiree medical programs permit retirees who meet certain age and service requirements to continue medical coverage between retirement and medicare eligibility eligible employees are required to pay a portion of the costs of their retiree medical benefits which in some cases may be offset by accumulated unused sick time at the time of their retirement plan benefits are subject to copayments deductibles and other limits as described in the plans 

the company accounts for other postretirement benefits by recognizing the difference between plan assets and obligations or the plan’s funded status in its financial statements under gaap other postretirement benefit expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees’ approximate service periods and is generally calculated independently of funding decisions or requirements the company has not been required to prefund its current and future plan obligations which has resulted in a significant net obligation as discussed below 

ual’s benefit obligation was 25 billion and 21 billion for the other postretirement benefit plans at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively the yearoveryear increase is due to continental plan obligations assumed by ual in the merger as well as changes in the assumptions used to value the obligation for united’s plan such as the decrease in the discount rate 

the calculation of other postretirement benefit expense and obligations requires the use of a number of assumptions including the assumed discount rate for measuring future payment obligations and the health care cost trend rate ual determines the appropriate discount rate for each of its plans based on current rates on high quality corporate bonds that would generate the cash flow necessary to pay plan benefits when due ual’s weighted average discount rate to determine its benefit obligations as of december 31 2010 was 513 as compared to 569 for december 31 2009 the health care cost trend rate assumed by united and continental for 2010 was 85 and 75 respectively as compared to assumed trend rates for 2011 of 80 and 75 respectively a 10 increasedecrease in assumed health care trend rates would increasedecrease ual’s total service and interest cost for the year ended december 31 2010 by 20 million16 million respectively detailed information regarding the company’s other postretirement plans including key assumptions is included in note 9 to the financial statements in item 8 of this report 

actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions under the applicable accounting standards those gains and losses are not required to be recognized currently as other postretirement expense but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive 

  

income and amortized into expense over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees the company’s accounting policy is to not apply the corridor approach available under applicable gaap with respect to amortization of amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income under the corridor approach amortization of any gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income is required only if at the beginning of the year the accumulated gain or loss exceeds 10 of the greater of the benefit obligation or the fair value of assets if amortization is required the minimum amount outside the corridor divided by the average remaining service period of active employees is recognized as expense the corridor approach is intended to reduce volatility of amounts recorded in pension expense each year since the company has elected not to apply the corridor approach all gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are amortized to expense over the remaining years of service of the covered active employees at december 31 2010 and 2009 ual had unrecognized actuarial gains of 24 million and 155 million respectively recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income for its other postretirement benefit plans 

business combination measurements in accordance with applicable accounting standards ual estimated the fair value of continental’s assets and liabilities as of the closing date of the merger october 1 2010 these fair value measurements did not result in gains or losses but were instead an input to the calculation of goodwill related to the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from continental in the merger additional changes in the fair values of these assets and liabilities from the current estimated values as well as changes in other assumptions could significantly impact the reported value of goodwill 

the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were determined using the market income and cost approaches the fair value measurements were primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market other than for derivative financial instruments and certain longterm debt assumed in the merger the market approach which indicates value for a subject asset based on available market pricing for comparable assets was utilized to estimate the fair value of continental’s aircraft and operating leases the market approach used by the company included prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving comparable assets as well as pricing guides and other sources we considered the current market for the aircraft the maintenance condition of the aircraft and the expected proceeds from the sale of the assets among other factors we also utilized the market approach to value certain intangible assets such as airport takeoff and landing slots when sufficient market information was available the income approach was primarily used to value intangible assets including the frequent flyer database international route authorities alliances the continental logo and tradename and certain airport takeoff and landing slots the income approach indicates value for a subject asset based on the present value of cash flows projected to be generated by the asset projected cash flows are discounted at a required market rate of return that reflects the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money the cost approach which estimates value by determining the current cost of replacing an asset with another of equivalent economic utility was used as appropriate for certain assets for which the market and income approaches could not be applied due to the nature of the asset the cost to replace a given asset reflects the estimated reproduction or replacement cost for the asset less an allowance for loss in value due to depreciation 

the fair value of continental’s pension and postretirement plans was determined by measuring the plans funded status as of the merger closing date any excess projected benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets was recognized as a liability one of the significant assumptions in determining the projected benefit obligation is the discount rate we determined the appropriate discount rate for each of the plans based on current rates on high quality corporate bonds that would generate the cash flow necessary to pay plan benefits when due which resulted in a discount rate of 52 for pension plans and 46 for postretirement plans other significant assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate retirement age and mortality assumptions these assumptions are discussed further in note 9 to the financial statements in item 8 

  

the fair value of continental’s onepass frequent flyer program liability was determined based on the weighted average equivalent ticket value of outstanding miles at october 1 2010 that were expected to be redeemed the weightedaverage equivalent ticket value reflects differing classes of service domestic and international itineraries and the carrier providing the award travel see the frequent flyer awards critical accounting policy above for additional information

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend interest rates our net income loss is affected by fluctuations in interest rates eg interest expense on variablerate debt and interest income earned on shortterm investments the company’s policy is to manage interest rate risk through a combination of fixed and variable rate debt and by entering into swap agreements depending upon market conditions the following table summarizes information related to the company’s interest rate market risk at december 31 2010 in millions 

 

  

      a change in market interest rates would also impact interest income earned on our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments assuming our cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments remain at their average 2010 levels a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a corresponding increase or decrease in ual united and continental interest income of approximately 77 million 43 million and 34 million respectively during 2011 

commodity price risk aircraft fuel our results of operations and liquidity are significantly impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel 

to protect against increases in the prices of aircraft fuel the company routinely hedges a portion of its future fuel requirements provided the hedges are expected to be cost effective the company uses fixed price swaps purchased call options collars or other such commonly used financial hedge instruments these hedge instruments are based directly on aircraft fuel or closely related commodities like heating oil and crude oil the company strives to maintain fuel hedging levels and exposure consistent with industry standards so that the company’s fuel cost is not disproportionate to the fuel costs of its major competitors 

some hedge instruments may result in losses if the underlying commodity prices drop below specified floors or swap prices however the negative impact of these losses may be outweighed by the benefit of lower aircraft fuel cost since the company typically hedges a portion of its future fuel requirements and uses swaps or sold puts as a part of a collar on only a portion of the fuel requirement that it does hedge the company does not enter into derivative instruments for nonrisk management purposes 

  

the company may adjust its hedging program based on changes in market conditions the following table summarizes information related to the company’s cost of aircraft fuel and hedging in millions except percentages 

 

  

    as of december 31 2010 our projected fuel requirements for 2011 were hedged as follows 

 

  

   

foreign currency the company generates revenues and incurs expenses in numerous foreign currencies changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the company’s results of operations through changes in the dollar value of foreign currencydenominated operating revenues and expenses some of the company’s more significant foreign currency exposures include the canadian dollar chinese renminbi japanese yen british pound and the european euro the company does not enter into derivative instruments for nonrisk management purposes 

at december 31 2010 and 2009 united did not have any foreign currency hedges at december 31 2010 continental had forward contracts outstanding to hedge 24 of its projected japanese yendenominated cash inflows primarily from passenger ticket sales through 2011 at december 31 2010 the fair value of those hedges was 7 million and is included in other current liabilities in continental’s consolidated balance sheets continental estimates that a uniform strengthening of 10 in the value of the us dollar relative to the japanese yen at december 31 2010 would increase the fair value of its yen hedges by 10 million and increase its underlying exposure by 40 million resulting in a net loss of 30 million

each merger incentive rsu represents the right to receive a cash payment upon achievement of the related performance goal based on the then fair market value of a share of ual’s common stock which fair market value is determined based on an average closing price over 20 trading days immediately preceding the time of achievement of such goal vesting of a portion of the merger incentive rsus is based on achievement of certain milestones that have been set by the compensation committee including integration of customer loyalty programs integration of reservation systems ratification of new joint collective bargaining agreements and obtaining a single operating certificate from the faa vesting of the remainder of the merger incentive rsus is based on achievement of revenue and cost synergies over a threeyear performance period ending on december 31 2013 as a general matter each tranche of the merger incentive rsus will vest and will be paid in cash to the recipients following the achievement of the performance goal for such tranche provided that the tranche relating to the achievement of revenue and cost synergies will vest and be paid after the threeyear

in general and subject to limited exceptions set forth in the merger performance incentive award notice the compensation committee has the right to reduce or eliminate a payment under the merger performance incentive award notice that would otherwise be payable if the compensation committee determines that such reduction or elimination is appropriate based on ual’s level of unrestricted cash and cash available under unused credit lines as of the time of achievement of the performance goal provided however that any such reduction or elimination shall apply in a uniform manner to all participants who are otherwise entitled to receive payments under corresponding provisions of their respective merger performance incentive award notices 

pbgc 

after the may 2010 announcement of the merger agreement the pension benefit guaranty corporation the “pbgc” requested certain information from continental to assess the merger’s impact on continental’s qualified defined benefit programs the “pbgc information request” subsequently shortly before the closing of the merger the pbgc took the position that the merger would constitute a “fundamental change” under the indenture the “pbgc indenture” governing ual’s 6 senior notes due 2031 held by pbgc the “6 senior notes” which would require ual to offer to redeem the 597 million outstanding principal amount of the 6 senior notes at par payable in cash or shares of ual common stock ual strongly believes based on the language of the pbgc indenture market practice and relevant statutes and case law that the merger did not constitute a “fundamental change” under the pbgc indenture and that the pbgc’s position is without merit in the unlikely event that the pbgc were to prevail in its position that the merger constituted a “fundamental change” the redemption of the 6 senior notes could require the prepayment of amounts outstanding under united’s amended and restated revolving credit term loan and guaranty agreement dated as of february 2 2007 9875 senior secured notes due 2013 and 120 senior second lien notes due 2013 which aggregated 22 billion principal amount as of december 31 2010 ual believes that if such redemption were required ual has adequate liquidity to satisfy such obligations and that new financings could be arranged substantially replacing the amounts prepaid although potentially on not as favorable terms 

on september 30 2010 the pbgc ual and continental entered into a standstill agreement providing that on or before january 31 2011 they will not initiate any court or administrative proceeding regarding continental’s qualified defined benefit programs or the 6 senior notes in each case as they relate to the consummation of the merger or to assert in any court or administrative proceeding that the merger did or did not constitute a “fundamental change” under the pbgc indenture in addition the pbgc and continental agreed on a schedule for providing the information requested by the pbgc relating to continental’s qualified defined 

  

benefit programs the parties also agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve their disagreements with respect to the pbgc indenture and the production of information by continental continental provided to the pbgc the information that the pbgc requested and although the standstill agreement has expired the parties continue to try to resolve these matters ual cannot predict any further action that may be taken by the pbgc although there can be no assurance as to any particular outcome ual believes that these matters will be resolved in a manner that will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations

operations 

segments the company operates its businesses through two reporting segments mainline and regional affiliates united express operations the company manages its business as an integrated network with assets deployed across its mainline and regional carrier networks this focus seeks to maximize the profitability of the overall airline network financial information on the company’s reporting segments and operating revenues by geographic regions as reported to the dot can be found in note 9 “segment information” in the footnotes 

mainline the company’s mainline operating revenues were 133 billion 171 billion and 170 billion in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively as of december 31 2009 mainline domestic operations served approximately 80 destinations primarily throughout the us and canada and operated hubs at o’hare denver lax sfo and washington dulles mainline international operations serve the pacific atlantic and latin america regions the pacific region includes nonstop service to beijing hong kong osaka seoul shanghai sydney and tokyo and direct service to bangkok beijing seasonal seoul singapore and taipei via tokyo direct service to ho chi minh city and singapore via hong kong and to melbourne via sydney the atlantic region includes nonstop service to amsterdam brussels dubai frankfurt geneva kuwait city london moscow munich paris rome and zurich and commencing in april 2010 direct service to bahrain through kuwait city the latin american region offers nonstop service to buenos aires rio de janeiro seasonal and sao paulo and direct service to rio de janeiro via sao paulo the latin american region also serves various mexico destinations including cancun cozumel seasonal mexico city puerto vallarta and san jose del cabo various caribbean points including aruba and seasonal service to montego bay punta cana and st maarten and central america including liberia costa rica seasonal united will fly to the african continent commencing in the second quarter of 2010 serving accra ghana and plans to add service to lagos nigeria pending governmental approvals 

  

ual’s operating revenues attributed to mainline domestic operations were 77 billion 97 billion and 109 billion in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively operating revenues attributed to mainline international operations were 56 billion 74 billion and 61 billion in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively for purposes of the company’s geographic revenue reporting the company considers destinations in mexico and the caribbean to be part of the latin america region as opposed to the domestic region 

the mainline segment operated 360 aircraft as of december 31 2009 and produced 1227 billion available seat miles “asms” and 1005 billion revenue passenger miles “rpms” during 2009 in 2008 the mainline segment produced 1358 billion asms and 1101 billion rpms 

regional affiliates regional affiliates operating revenues were approximately 31 billion in years 2009 2008 and 2007 united has contractual relationships with various regional carriers to provide regional jet and turboprop service branded as united express united express is an extension of the united mainline network atlantic southeast airlines colgan airlines expressjet gojet airlines mesa airlines “mesa” shuttle america skywest airlines “skywest” and trans states airlines are all regional carriers most of which operate under capacity purchase agreements with united under these agreements united pays the regional carriers contractuallyagreed fees carriercontrolled costs for operating these flights plus a variable reimbursement incentive payment based on agreed performance metrics the carriercontrolled costs are based on specific rates for various operating expenses of the regional carriers such as crew expenses maintenance and aircraft ownership some of which are multiplied by specific operating statistics eg block hours departures while others are fixed monthly amounts the incentive payment is a markup applied to the carriercontrolled costs for superior operational performance under these capacity purchase agreements united is responsible for all fuel costs incurred as well as landing fees facilities rent and deicing costs which are passed through without any markup in return the regional carriers operate this capacity on schedules determined by united united also determines pricing revenues and inventory levels and assumes the inventory and distribution risk for the available seats in january 2010 mesa filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization the company does not expect this filing to have any material effect on its regional affiliates flight operations financial position or results of operations 

the capacity purchase agreements between the regional carriers and united do not include the provision of ground handling services as a result regional affiliates obtain ground handling services from a variety of thirdparty providers in addition to utilizing internal united resources in some cases regional affiliates carriers operated 292 aircraft under capacity purchase agreements as of december 31 2009 and produced 180 billion asms and 138 billion rpms during 2009 while producing 162 billion asms and 121 billion rpms in 2008 

while the regional carriers operating under capacity purchase agreements comprise more than 95 of regional affiliates flights the company also has limited prorate agreements with colgan airlines skywest and trans states airlines under these prorate agreements united and its prorate partners agree to divide revenue collected from each passenger according to a formula while both united and the prorate partners are individually responsible for their own costs of operations united also collects a program fee from colgan airlines to cover certain marketing and distribution costs such as credit card transaction fees global distribution systems “gds” transaction fees and frequent flyer costs unlike capacity purchase agreements these prorate agreements require the regional carrier to retain the control and risk of scheduling market selection seat pricing and inventory for its flights 

united cargo united cargo offers both domestic and international shipping through a variety of services including united small package delivery express and general cargo services freight shipments comprise approximately 88 of united cargo’s volumes with mail shipments comprising the remainder during 2009 united cargo accounted for approximately 3 of the company’s operating revenues by generating 536 million in freight and mail revenue a 37 decrease versus 2008 

united services united services is a global airline support business offering customers comprehensive aircraft maintenance repair and overhaul services which include engine line and global emergency maintenance 

  

services united services brings nearly 80 years of experience to serve over 100 airline customer contracts worldwide during 2009 and 2008 united services generated approximately 134 million and 167 million respectively in thirdparty revenue 

fuel the price and availability of jet fuel significantly affects the company’s results of operations fuel has been one of the company’s largest operating expenses for the last several years the company has a risk management strategy to hedge a portion of its price risk related to projected jet fuel requirements the company’s hedging strategy currently utilizes purchased calls and swaps if fuel prices rise above the fixed swap price the company’s counterparties are required to make settlement payments to the company while if fuel prices fall below the fixed swap price the company is required to make settlement payments to its fuel hedge counterparties in addition the company has been and may in the future be required to provide counterparties with cash collateral prior to settlement of the hedge positions 

fuel prices were extremely volatile during the three year period ended december 31 2009 as shown in the table below in 2009 the company benefited from a lower average purchase price as compared to the two prior years due to lower market prices for jet fuel the company’s operating results in 2008 were adversely impacted by the unprecedented increase in the price of crude oil to a peak of approximately 145 per barrel in july 2008 followed by a decrease of more than 100 per barrel to approximately 45 per barrel in december 2008 this volatility resulted in the company reporting total fuel hedge losses of approximately 11 billion in 2008 a significant portion of these losses was unrealized as of december 31 2008 and the related contracts were settled in 2009 as shown in the table below fuel prices were somewhat less volatile in 2009 and 2007 as compared to 2008 resulting in less significant hedge impacts in these years total fuel hedge gains of 135 million and 83 million were reported in 2009 and 2007 respectively the company’s results of operations benefit from lower fuel prices on its unhedged fuel consumption and its liquidity is subject to fluctuations based on cash settlements and collateral that may be required 

the company accounts for the majority of its fuel derivative contracts as economic hedges which are markedtomarket with gains and losses classified as fuel expense remaining fuel derivative contracts which do not qualify for economic hedge accounting are markedtomarket with gains and losses classified as nonoperating expense see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note 12 “fair value measurements and derivative instruments” in the footnotes for additional details regarding gains and losses from settled and open positions cash settlements unrealized amounts at the end of the period and hedge collateral derivative gains and losses from contracts qualifying for economic hedge accounting are recorded in mainline fuel expense and are not allocated to regional affiliates fuel expense 

 

  

   

to ensure adequate supplies of fuel and to obtain a measure of control over fuel costs the company arranges to have fuel shipped on major pipelines and stored close to its major hub locations although the company currently does not anticipate a significant reduction in the availability of jet fuel a number of factors make predicting fuel prices and fuel availability uncertain including changes in world energy demand geopolitical uncertainties affecting energy supplies from oilproducing nations industrial accidents threats of terrorism directed at oil supply infrastructure extreme weather conditions causing temporary shutdowns of production and refining capacity as well as changes in relative demand for other petroleum products that may impact the quantity and price of jet fuel produced from period to period 

alliances united has a number of bilateral and multilateral alliances with other airlines which enhance travel options for customers seeking access to markets that united does not serve directly these marketing alliances typically include one or more of the following features joint frequent flyer program participation codesharing of flight operations whereby seats on one carrier’s selected flights can be marketed under the brand name of another carrier coordination of reservations ticketing passenger checkin baggage handling and flight schedules and other resourcesharing activities 

the most significant of the company’s alliances is the star alliance a global integrated airline network cofounded by united in 1997 and the most comprehensive airline alliance in the world as of january 1 2010 star alliance carriers serve approximately 1100 destinations in 175 countries with over 19700 daily flights current star alliance partners in addition to united are adria airways air canada air china air new zealand all nippon airways asiana airlines the austrian airlines group blue1 bmi brussels airlines continental airlines “continental” croatia airlines egyptair lot polish airlines lufthansa scandinavian airlines shanghai airlines singapore airlines south african airways spanair swiss international air lines tap portugal thai turkish airlines and us airways aegean airlines air india and tam airlines have been announced as future star alliance members 

during 2009 continental joined united and its 24 other partners in the star alliance the alliance partnership between united and continental allows the two airlines to link their networks and services worldwide to the benefit of customers employees and shareholders creating new revenue opportunities cost savings and other efficiencies continental’s and united’s route networks are highly complementary with little overlap so they add value to each other and to customers who are planning domestic and international travel under codesharing customers benefit from a coordinated process for reservationsticketing checkin flight connections and baggage transfer frequent flyer reciprocity allows members of continental’s onepass program and united’s mileage plus program to earn miles in their accounts when flying on either partner airline and redeem awards on both carriers with continental as a partner united has added more than 60 new destinations to its alliance network and dramatically enhanced its market presence in new york and latin america united and continental are exploring opportunities to capture important cost savings in the areas of information technology frequent flyer programs airport operations lounges procurement and sales and marketing 

in addition pursuant to antitrust immunity approval by the dot united air canada continental and lufthansa are implementing a joint venture covering transatlantic routes that will deliver highly competitive flight schedules fares and service the european commission is conducting a review of the anticipated competitive impact of the joint venture operations in december 2009 united and continental applied jointly with all nippon airways to the dot for approval of and immunity from us antitrust laws for a series of alliance agreements between and among the carriers including a transpacific joint venture agreement a grant of antitrust immunity will enable the three carriers to integrate the services they operate between the united states and japan and other destinations in asia to derive potentially significant benefits from coordinated scheduling pricing sales and inventory management the integration of services will also allow the three carriers to offer passengers highly competitive flight schedules fares and services the approval of the agreements and the dot’s grant of antitrust immunity which is currently pending is a condition precedent to japan bringing into force the recently announced open skies agreement between japan and the united states see industry regulation  below 

  

united also has independent marketing agreements with other air carriers including aer lingus great lakes aviation gulfstream international hawaiian island air qatar airways taca group and tam airlines 

mileage plus mileage plus builds customer loyalty by offering awards and services to frequent travelers mileage plus members can earn mileage credit for flights on united united express members of the star alliance and certain other airlines that participate in the program miles can also be earned by purchasing the goods and services of our nonairline partners such as hotels car rental companies and credit card issuers mileage credits can be redeemed for free discounted or upgraded travel and nontravel awards there are more than 56 million members enrolled in mileage plus in 2009 21 million mileage plus travel awards were used on united as compared to 23 million and 22 million in 2008 and 2007 respectively these amounts represent the number of awards for which travel was provided and not the number of available seats that were allocated to award travel these awards represented 83 91 and 80 of united’s total revenue passenger miles in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively in addition mileage plus members redeemed miles for approximately 885000 nonunited travel awards in 2009 as compared to 613000 in 2008 nonunited travel awards include red carpet club memberships car and hotel awards merchandise and travel solely on another air carrier among others the increase in the number of nonunited travel awards redeemed was due to the expansion of the merchandise programs and the launch of a new car and hotel award program in the fourth quarter of 2009 total miles redeemed for travel on united in 2009 including classofservice upgrades represented 86 of the total miles redeemed for both completed and future travel for a detailed description of the accounting treatment of mileage plus program activity see critical accounting policies in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

distribution channels the majority of united’s airline seat inventory continues to be distributed through the traditional channels of travel agencies and gds such as sabre and galileo the growing use of alternative distribution systems including wwwunitedcom and gds new entrants provides united with an opportunity to lower its ticket distribution costs to encourage customer use of lowercost channels and capitalize on these costsaving opportunities the company will continue to expand the capabilities of its website 

industry conditions 

seasonality the air travel business is subject to seasonal fluctuations historically revenues are better in the second and third quarters which reflect higher travel demand than the first and fourth quarter revenues which reflect lower travel demand 

economic conditions the company’s costs and revenues are highly correlated to the economic health and growth of the united states and the global markets it serves the global recession experienced over the past two years has resulted in declines in industry passenger demand accompanied by a reduction in fare levels the drop in demand has been higher among business and premium cabin travelers as corporations have significantly reduced their spending on business travel as discussed further in item 1a risk factors  and in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the current economic conditions have had and may continue to have negative impacts on passenger demand revenues the level of credit card sales activity and our cargo operations in response to these economic conditions united and other carriers in the industry implemented significant reductions in domestic and international capacity during 2008 and 2009 

domestic competition the domestic airline industry is highly competitive and dynamic in domestic markets new and existing us carriers are generally free to initiate service between any two points within the united states united’s competitors consist primarily of other airlines and to a lesser extent other forms of transportation and emerging technological substitutes such as videoconferencing competition can be direct in the form of another carrier flying the exact nonstop route or indirect where a carrier serves the same two cities nonstop from an alternative airport in that city or via an itinerary requiring a connection at another airport 

  

united’s actual and forecasted capacity increases decreases for 2009 and 2010 respectively as compared to the yearago periods are summarized in the following table 

 

 carriers that operate as low cost carriers or that have lower cost structures achieved through reorganization may be more competitive with the rest of the industry resulting in lower fares for such carriers’ passengers with a potential negative impact on the company’s revenues in addition future airline mergers or acquisitions similar to delta airlines’ acquisition of northwest airlines in late 2008 may enable airlines to improve their revenue and cost performance relative to peers and thus enhance their competitive position within the industry 

domestic pricing decisions are largely affected by the need to be competitive with other us airlines fare discounting by competitors has historically had a negative effect on the company’s financial results because united often finds it necessary to match competitors’ fares to maintain passenger traffic attempts by united and other airlines to raise fares often fail due to a lack of competitive matching 

international competition in united’s international networks the company competes not only with us airlines but also with foreign carriers competition on specified international routes is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulations the united states and european union “eu” agreement in 2008 to reduce restrictions on flight operations between the two regions has increased competition for united’s transatlantic network from both us and european airlines in our pacific operations competition is expected to increase as the governments of the united states and china recently approved additional us and chinese airlines to fly new routes between the two countries although the commencement of some new services to china has been postponed due to the weak global economy competition in the pacific may likely increase when the recently announced open skies agreement between the united states and japan becomes effective which is currently expected to be in the fall of 2010 subject to certain conditions precedent being met see industry regulation  below competition in the pacific may also increase if japan airlines which filed for bankruptcy in january 2010 emerges from restructuring as a stronger competitor in the region part of united’s ability to successfully compete with nonus carriers on international routes is its ability to generate traffic from and to the entire us via its integrated domestic route network foreign carriers are currently prohibited by us law from carrying local passengers between two points in the us and united experiences comparable restrictions in many foreign countries in addition us carriers are often constrained from carrying passengers to points beyond designated international gateway cities due to limitations in air service agreements and restrictions imposed unilaterally by foreign governments to compensate for these structural limitations us and foreign carriers have entered into alliances and marketing arrangements that allow these carriers to exchange traffic between each other’s flights and route networks see alliances above for further information 

insurance united carries hull and liability insurance of a type customary in the air transportation industry in amounts that the company deems appropriate covering passenger liability public liability and damage to united’s aircraft and other physical property united also maintains other types of insurance such as property directors and officers cargo workers’ compensation automobile and the like with limits and deductibles that are standard within the industry losses that materially exceed these limits could have a significant impact on the company after the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks the company’s insurance premiums increased significantly but have since been reduced reflecting the market’s changing perception of risk as well as the company’s ongoing capacity reductions additionally after september 11 2001 commercial insurers canceled united’s liability insurance for losses resulting from war and associated perils terrorism sabotage hijacking and other similar events the us government subsequently agreed to provide commercial warrisk insurance for 

  

us airlines and has renewed this coverage on a periodic basis the current warrisk policy is effective until august 31 2010 and covers losses to employees passengers third parties and aircraft if the us government does not extend this coverage beyond august 31 2010 obtaining comparable coverage from commercial underwriters could result in substantially higher premiums and more restrictive terms if it is available at all see “increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage may adversely impact the company’s operations and financial results” in item 1a risk factors  below 

industry regulation 

domestic regulation 

general all carriers engaged in air transportation in the us are subject to regulation by the dot among its responsibilities the dot issues certificates of public convenience and necessity for domestic air transportation no air carrier unless exempted may provide air transportation without a dot certificate of public convenience and necessity grants international route authorities approves international codeshare agreements regulates methods of competition and enforces certain consumer protection regulations such as those dealing with advertising denied boarding compensation and baggage liability 

airlines also are regulated by the federal aviation administration “faa” a division of the dot primarily in the areas of flight operations maintenance and other safety and technical matters the faa has authority to issue air carrier operating certificates and aircraft airworthiness certificates prescribe maintenance procedures and regulate pilot and other employee training among other responsibilities from time to time the faa issues rules that require air carriers to take certain actions such as the inspection or modification of aircraft and other equipment that may cause the company to incur substantial unplanned expenses the airline industry is also subject to various other federal laws and regulations the us department of homeland security “dhs” has jurisdiction over virtually all aspects of civil aviation security see legislation  below the us department of justice “doj” has jurisdiction over certain airline competition matters the us postal service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail labor relations in the airline industry are generally governed by the railway labor act “rla” the company is also subject to inquiries by the dot faa and other us and international regulatory bodies 

airport access access to landing and takeoff rights or “slots” at several major us airports and many foreign airports served by united are or recently have been subject to government regulation domestic slot restrictions currently apply at reagan national airport in washington dc “washington reagan” john f kennedy international airport and laguardia airport “laguardia” both in new york and newark liberty international airport in new jersey 

in december 2009 the dot issued a new rule intended to enhance air passenger protections the new rule which goes into effect in april 2010 creates new areas of regulation in passenger protection including a requirement that certain carriers including united adopt contingency plans for lengthy tarmac delays at most us airports a carrier’s failure to meet certain service performance criteria under the rule could subject it to substantial civil penalties 

legislation the airline industry is also subject to legislative activity that may have an impact on operations and costs specifically the law that authorizes federal excise taxes and fees assessed on airline tickets expired in september 2007 but has been extended multiple times and has most recently been extended until march 31 2010 in addition to federal state and local taxes and fees that the company is currently subject to proposed taxes and fees are currently pending that may increase the company’s operating costs if imposed on the company congress is currently attempting to pass comprehensive reauthorization legislation to impose a new funding structure and make other changes to faa operations past aviation reauthorization bills have affected a wide range of areas of interest to the industry including air traffic control operations capacity control issues airline competition issues aircraft and airport technology requirements safety issues taxes fees and other funding sources congress may also pass other legislation that could increase labor and operating costs climate change 

  

legislation which would regulate greenhouse gas emissions is also likely to be a significant area of legislative and regulatory focus and could adversely impact fuel costs see environmental regulation  below 

customer service issues have remained active areas for both congress and dot regulators during 2009 in addition to dot customer service regulations discussed above additional regulations or legislation imposing more specific customer service requirements are likely to be approved in 2010 though what those requirements might be is unclear at this time the dot has also proceeded with other regulatory changes in this area including proposals regarding treatment of and payments to passengers involuntarily denied boarding domestic baggage liability and airline scheduling practices additionally since september 11 2001 aviation security has been and continues to be a subject of frequent legislative and regulatory action requiring changes to the company’s security processes and frequently increasing the cost of its security procedures 

international regulation 

general international air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation in connection with united’s international services the company is regulated by both the us government and the governments of the foreign countries united serves in addition the availability of international routes to us carriers is regulated by aviation agreements between the us and foreign governments and in some cases fares and schedules require the approval of the dot andor the relevant foreign governments 

airport access historically access to foreign markets has been tightly controlled through bilateral agreements between the us and each foreign country involved these agreements regulate the markets served the number of carriers allowed to serve each market and the frequency of carriers’ flights since the early 1990s the us has pursued a policy of “open skies” meaning all carriers have access to the destination under which the us government has negotiated a number of bilateral agreements allowing unrestricted access between us and foreign markets currently there are more than 90 open skies agreements in effect additionally all of the airports that united serves in europe and asia maintain slot controls and many of these are restrictive due to congestion at these airports london heathrow frankfurt and tokyo narita are among the most restrictive airports due to capacity limitations united has significant operations at these locations 

united’s ability to serve some foreign markets and expand into certain others is limited by the absence altogether of aviation agreements between the us government and the relevant governments shifts in us or foreign government aviation policies may lead to the alteration or termination of air service agreements depending on the nature of any such change the value of united’s international route authorities and slot rights may be materially enhanced or diminished 

the useu open skies agreement became effective in 2008 this agreement replaced the bilateral arrangements between the us government and the 27 eu member states based on the us open skies model it provides us and eu carriers with expansive rights that have increased competition in transatlantic markets for example us and eu carriers now have the right to operate between any point in the united states and the eu the agreement has no direct impact on airport slot rights nor does it provide for a reallocation of existing slots including those at london heathrow london heathrow currently remains subject to both slot and facility constraints the agreement provides united with additional commercial opportunities since it triggered the effectiveness of the dot’s grant of antitrust immunity to united and british carrier bmi creating increased cooperation between the two carriers in the transatlantic market because of the diverse nature of potential impacts on united’s business however the overall future impact of the useu agreement on united’s business cannot be predicted with certainty 

also in 2008 the eu adopted interpretive guidance and legislation that impacts the company the commission officially sanctioned secondary slot trading a current practice among carriers that involves the sale purchase or lease of slots this action resolves disputes about the legality of slot exchanges at eu airports including london heathrow 

  

in december 2009 the united states and japan reached agreement on the text of an open skies agreement to replace the 1952 bilateral agreement on air service between the united states and japan the open skies agreement is expected to enter into force in the fall of 2010 subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent pursuant to the agreement any us or japanese carrier will be able to fly between any point in the united states and any point in japan and in the case of us carriers beyond japan to points in other countries the carrier is authorized to serve the agreement will also eliminate the restrictions on the number of frequencies carriers can operate and require governments in both the united states and japan to concur before taking action to regulate a carrier’s fares or rates 

also in december 2009 united and continental applied jointly with all nippon airways to the dot for approval of and immunity from us antitrust laws for a series of alliance agreements between and among the carriers including a transpacific joint venture agreement this application is currently pending see alliances above for additional information 

environmental regulation 

the airline industry is subject to increasingly stringent federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning emissions to the air discharges to surface and subsurface waters safe drinking water and the management of hazardous substances oils and waste materials new regulations surrounding the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide have been adopted and are otherwise being considered for promulgation both internationally and within the united states which is discussed further below united is carefully evaluating the impact of such new and proposed regulations other areas of developing andor new regulations include the state of california rulemakings regarding air emissions from ground support equipment and federal rulemakings concerning the discharge of deicing fluid and the regulation of aircraft drinking water supplies 

future environmental regulatory developments such as in regard to climate change in the united states and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in the airline industry some climate change laws and regulations that have gone into effect apply to united including environmental taxes for certain international flights including the united kingdom’s air passenger duty limited greenhouse gas reporting requirements and landbased planning laws which could apply to airports and could affect airlines in certain circumstances in addition a 2009 eu directive required eu member countries to enact legislation that would include aviation within the eu’s existing carbon emissions trading scheme effective in 2012 the legality of applying such a scheme to noneu airlines has been widely questioned in december 2009 the air transportation association joined by united continental and american airlines filed a lawsuit in the united kingdom challenging regulations that transpose into uk law the eu emissions trading scheme as applied to us carriers in addition noneu countries are considering filing a formal challenge before the united nations’ international civil aviation organization with respect to the eu’s inclusion of noneu carriers it is not clear whether the trading scheme will withstand such challenges if the scheme is found to be valid however it could significantly increase the cost of carriers operating in the eu by requiring the purchase of carbon credits although the precise cost to united is difficult to calculate with certainty due to a number of variables and will depend among other things on united’s carbon emissions from flights to and from the eu and the price of carbon credits the precise nature of any such requirements and their applicability to united are difficult to predict but the impact to the company and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant including the potential for increased fuel costs carbon taxes or fees or a requirement to purchase carbon credits 

the airline industry is also subject to other environmental laws and regulations including those that require the company to remediate soil or groundwater to meet certain objectives compliance with all environmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures under the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as “superfund” and similar environmental cleanup laws generators of waste materials and owners or operators of facilities can be subject to liability for 

  

investigation and remediation costs at locations that have been identified as requiring response actions the company also conducts voluntary environmental assessment and remediation actions environmental cleanup obligations can arise from among other circumstances the operation of aircraft fueling facilities and primarily involve airport sites future costs associated with these activities are currently not expected to have a material adverse affect on the company’s business 

employees 

as of december 31 2009 the company and its subsidiaries had approximately 47000 active employees of whom approximately 82 were represented by various us labor organizations the employee groups number of employees and labor organization for each of united’s collective bargaining groups were as follows 

 

  

 collective bargaining agreements are negotiated under the rla which governs labor relations in the air transportation industry and such agreements typically do not contain an expiration date instead they specify an amendable date upon which the contract is considered “open for amendment” contracts remain in effect while new agreements are negotiated during the negotiation period both the company and the negotiating union are required to maintain the status quo 

during the second quarter of 2009 the company began negotiations with its labor unions as all of united’s domestic labor contracts became amendable during january 2010 consistent with its contractual commitments united served “section 6” notices to all six of its labor unions in april 2009 to commence the collective bargaining process in august 2009 united filed for mediation assistance in conjunction with three of its six unions–the air line pilots association “alpa” association of flight attendants–communication workers of america “afa” and the international association of machinists and aerospace workers “iam” in january 2010 the company also filed for mediation assistance in conjunction with another of its unions professional airline flight control association “pafca” these filings were consistent with commitments contained in current labor contracts which provided that the parties would jointly invoke the mediation services of the national mediation board “nmb” in the event agreements had not been reached by august 1 2009 while the labor contract with the international brotherhood of teamsters the “teamsters” also contemplates filing for mediation the parties have agreed to continue in direct negotiations the current contract with the international federation of professional and technical engineers “ifpte” does not contemplate filing for mediation the outcome of these negotiations may materially impact the company’s future financial results however it is too early in the process to assess the timing or magnitude of the impact if any

 item 1a risk factors tableend the following risk factors should be read carefully when evaluating the company’s business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this report and other statements the company or its representatives make from time to time any of the following risks could materially adversely affect the company’s business operating results financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this report 

risks related to the company’s business 

the amended credit facility and the indentures governing the senior notes impose certain operating and financial restrictions on the company and its subsidiaries the company may be unable to continue to comply with the covenants in these and other agreements which if not complied with could accelerate repayment under the amended credit facility or the indentures governing the senior notes as applicable thereby materially and adversely affecting the company’s liquidity 

the company’s amended and restated revolving credit term loan and guaranty agreement dated as of february 2 2007 the “amended credit facility” and the company’s indentures governing the 9875 senior secured notes due 2013 and 120 senior second lien notes due 2013 together the “senior notes” impose certain operating and financial covenants on the company and its subsidiaries 

among other covenants the terms of the amended credit facility require the company to maintain 

 

  

  

  

 the amended credit facility fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated as ebitdar to the sum of the following fixed charges for such period a cash interest expense and b cash aircraft operating rental expense ebitdar represents earnings before interest expense net of interest income income taxes depreciation amortization aircraft rent and certain cash and noncash charges as further defined by the amended credit facility the other adjustments to ebitdar include items such as foreign currency transaction losses increases in our deferred revenue obligation sharebased compensation expense nonrecurring or unusual losses any noncash nonrecurring charge or noncash restructuring charge a limited amount of cash restructuring charges certain cash transaction costs incurred with financing activities and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 

among other covenants the indentures governing the senior notes contain covenants related to the collateral including covenants requiring united subject to certain exceptions to maintain ownership of the collateral and to calculate the priority lien debt value ratio or secured debt value ratio as applicable and to maintain a minimum priority lien debt value ratio or minimum secured debt value ratio as applicable as of 

  

certain reference periods if the value of the company’s collateral underlying the senior notes declines the company may be required to provide the debtholders with additional collateral in order to avoid a default and a subsequent acceleration of the applicable debt obligations 

the company’s ability to comply with the covenants in the amended credit facility or the indentures governing the senior notes may be affected by events beyond its control including the overall industry revenue environment and the level of fuel costs and it may be required to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or alternative sources of financing the company cannot provide assurance that such waivers amendments or alternative financing could be obtained or if obtained would be on terms acceptable to the company 

a breach of certain of the covenants or restrictions contained in the company’s amended credit facility or indentures governing the senior notes could result in a default the amended credit facility and the indentures governing the senior notes contain a crossdefault provision with respect to final judgments that exceed 50 million and 70 million respectively in addition the indentures governing the senior notes contain a crossdefault provision where a default resulting in the acceleration of indebtedness under the amended credit facility could result in a default under the indentures a default under the agreements could allow the company’s debtholders to accelerate repayment of the obligations in these agreements andor to declare all borrowings outstanding thereunder to be due and payable if the company’s debt is accelerated its assets may not be sufficient to repay the obligations in the amended credit facility and the senior notes 

the company may be unable to continue to comply with certain covenants in agreements with financial institutions that process customer credit card transactions which if not complied with could materially and adversely affect the company’s liquidity 

the company has agreements with financial institutions that process customer credit card transactions for the sale of air travel and other services under certain of the company’s card processing agreements the financial institutions either require or have the right to require that united maintain a reserve equal to a portion of advance ticket sales that have been processed by that financial institution but for which the company has not yet provided the air transportation referred to as “relevant advance ticket sales” as of december 31 2009 the company had total advance ticket sales of approximately 15 billion of which approximately 80 related to credit card sales 

the company’s credit card processing agreement with paymentech and jpmorgan chase bank na contains a cash reserve requirement in addition to certain other risk protections provided to the processor the amount of any such cash reserve will be determined based on the amount of unrestricted cash held by the company as defined under the amended credit facility if the company’s unrestricted cash balance is at or more than 25 billion as of any calendar monthend measurement date its required reserve will remain at 25 million however if the company’s unrestricted cash is less than 25 billion its required reserve will increase to a percentage of relevant advance ticket sales as summarized in the following table 

 

  

 based on the company’s december 31 2009 unrestricted cash balance the company was not required to provide cash collateral above the current 25 million reserve balance 

  

united entered into a new agreement with american express on march 1 2009 with an initial five year term under the agreement in addition to certain other risk protections provided to american express the company will be required to provide reserves based primarily on its unrestricted cash balance and net current exposure as of any calendar monthend measurement date as summarized in the following table 

 

  

  the agreement with american express permits the company to provide certain replacement collateral in lieu of cash collateral as long as the company’s unrestricted cash is above 135 billion such replacement collateral may be pledged for any amount of the required reserve up to the full amount thereof with the stated value of such collateral determined according to the agreement replacement collateral may be comprised of aircraft slots and routes real estate or other collateral as agreed between the parties based on the company’s unrestricted cash balance at december 31 2009 the company was not required to provide any reserves under this agreement 

an increase in the future reserve requirements as provided by the terms of either or both of the company’s material card processing agreements could materially reduce the company’s liquidity 

the company may not be able to maintain adequate liquidity 

while the company’s cash flows from operations and its available capital have been sufficient to meet its current operating expenses lease obligations and debt service requirements to date the company’s future liquidity could be negatively impacted by many factors including but not limited to substantial volatility in the price of fuel declines in passenger and cargo demand associated with the global recession and deterioration of global financial systems and any of our future commitments for the purchase of aircraft during 2008 and 2009 the company experienced reduced demand for its services due to the weak global economy decreases in passenger and cargo demand resulting from a weak global economy resulted in both lower passenger volumes and lower ticket fares which adversely impacted our liquidity and may continue to adversely impact our results of operations and liquidity in 2010 in addition the company’s capacity cuts completed in 2008 and 2009 may not be sufficient to address lower demand due to the weak global economy see the risk factor entitled “economic and industry conditions constantly change and continued or worsening negative economic conditions in the united states and elsewhere may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations” below for further discussion of the adverse impacts of the weak economy on our operations 

in addition fuel prices continue to be extremely volatile which may negatively impact the company’s liquidity in the future certain of the company’s fuel hedges require that it post cash collateral with applicable counterparties if crude oil prices fall below certain prices the company provided cash collateral of 10 million to its fuel derivative counterparties as of december 31 2009 see note 12 “fair value measurements and derivative instruments” in the footnotes 

the company’s plans to address increased and volatile fuel prices and the weak global economy may not be successful in improving its results of operations and liquidity in addition the implementation of certain of these 

  

plans requires the use of cash for such items as severance payments lease termination fees and facility closure costs among others these cash requirements will reduce the company’s available cash for its ongoing operations 

as described above the company is required to comply with certain financial covenants under its amended credit facility the indentures governing the senior notes and certain of its credit card processing agreements the factors noted above among other things may impair the company’s ability to comply with these covenants or could allow certain of our credit card processors to increase the required reserves on our advance ticket sales which could have an adverse impact on the company’s financial position and liquidity depending on its ability to obtain a waiver of or otherwise mitigate the impact of the default if a default occurs under our amended credit facility and the indentures governing the senior notes the cost to cure any such default may adversely impact our financial position and liquidity 

in addition the company’s indebtedness at december 31 2009 was secured by collateral with a net carrying value of 80 billion as a result we may have limited remaining assets available as collateral for loans or other indebtedness which may make it difficult to raise additional capital to meet our liquidity needs our level of indebtedness noninvestment grade credit rating and the current market conditions may also make it difficult for us to raise capital to meet liquidity needs and may increase our cost of borrowing a higher cost of capital could negatively impact our results of operations financial position and liquidity 

see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further information regarding the company’s liquidity 

economic and industry conditions constantly change and continued or worsening negative economic conditions in the united states and elsewhere may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

our business and results of operations are significantly impacted by general economic and industry conditions industrywide passenger air travel varies from year to year robust demand for our air transportation services depends largely on favorable general economic conditions including the strength of the global and local economies low unemployment levels strong consumer confidence levels and the availability of consumer and business credit for leisure travelers air transportation is often a discretionary purchase that those consumers can eliminate from their spending in difficult economic times in addition during periods of poor economic conditions businesses usually reduce the volume of their business travel either due to costsavings initiatives or as a result of decreased business activity requiring travel the overall demand for air transportation in the united states has decreased due to adverse changes and continued deterioration of the us and global economies which has negatively impacted our results of operations for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 and may continue to have a significant negative impact on our future results of operations for an extended period of time while some economic indicators like the gdp are beginning to exhibit growth other economic indicators that affect air travel such as unemployment have not yet begun to recover and may not do so for an extended period of time in addition decreases in cargo revenues due to lower demand have a disproportionate impact on our operating results as our cargo revenues generally have higher margins as compared to our passenger revenues continuation or worsening of the current global recession may lead the company and other carriers to further reduce domestic or international capacity and may have a material adverse effect on the company’s revenues results of operations and liquidity 

continued periods of historically high fuel costs or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a material adverse impact on the company’s operating results 

the company’s operating results have been and could continue to be significantly impacted by changes in the supply or price of aircraft fuel both of which are impossible to predict the recordhigh fuel prices each year from 2005 through 2007 increased further in 2008 to new record highs with the crude oil spot price reaching approximately 145 per barrel in july 2008 at times united has not been able to increase its fares when fuel 

  

prices have risen due to the highly competitive nature of the airline industry united may not be able to increase its fares if fuel prices rise in the future and any such increases may not be sustainable in the highly competitive environment in addition fare increases may not totally offset the fuel price increase and may also reduce demand for air travel from time to time the company enters into hedging arrangements to protect against rising fuel costs the company’s hedging programs may use significant amounts of cash due to posting of cash collateral in some circumstances may not be successful in controlling fuel costs and may be limited due to market conditions and other factors see note 12 “fair value measurements and derivative instruments” in the footnotes for additional information on the company’s hedging programs 

additional terrorist attacks or the fear of such attacks even if not made directly on the airline industry could negatively affect the company and the airline industry 

the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 involving commercial aircraft severely and adversely impacted the company’s financial condition and results of operations as well as prospects for the airline industry among the effects experienced from the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks were substantial flight disruption costs caused by the faaimposed temporary grounding of the us airline industry’s fleet significantly increased security costs and associated passenger inconvenience increased insurance costs substantially higher ticket refunds and significantly decreased traffic and passenger revenue per revenue passenger mile “yield” 

additional terrorist attacks even if not made directly on the airline industry or the fear of or the precautions taken in anticipation of such attacks including elevated national threat warnings or selective cancellation or redirection of flights could materially and adversely affect the company and the airline industry the wars in iraq and afghanistan and additional international hostilities including heightened terrorist activity could also have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition liquidity and results of operations the company’s financial resources might not be sufficient to absorb the adverse effects of any further terrorist attacks or other international hostilities involving the united states or us interests 

the airline industry is highly competitive susceptible to price discounting and may undergo further bankruptcy restructuring or industry consolidation 

the us airline industry is characterized by substantial price competition some of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources or lower cost structures than united does or both in recent years the market share held by lowcost carriers has increased significantly large network carriers like united have often had a lack of pricing power within domestic markets 

in addition a number of carriers have filed for bankruptcy protection in recent years other domestic and international carriers could restructure in bankruptcy or threaten to do so to reduce their costs carriers operating under bankruptcy protection can operate in a manner that could be adverse to the company and could emerge from bankruptcy as more vigorous competitors 

during 2008 the us airline industry underwent consolidation with the merger of delta airlines and northwest airlines in 2009 regional mainline carriers midwest airlines and frontier airlines were acquired by republic airways and frontier airlines remains a direct competitor of united at its denver hub in early 2010 foreign carrier japan airlines filed for bankruptcy and began restructuring its business 

there is ongoing speculation that further airline industry consolidation could occur in the future united routinely monitors changes in the competitive landscape and engages in analysis and discussions regarding its strategic position including alliances asset acquisitions and divestitures and business combinations the company’s strategic alliance with continental airlines will not realize all of the benefits of a merger the company may have future discussions with other airlines regarding mergers andor other strategic alternatives if other airlines participate in merger activity and united does not those airlines may significantly improve their cost structures or revenue generation capabilities thereby potentially making them stronger competitors of united 

  

united and certain of its competitors implemented significant capacity reductions in 2008 and 2009 the company’s unit revenues may not be favorably impacted by the capacity reductions and its unit costs may be adversely impacted further certain of the company’s competitors may not reduce capacity or may increase capacity thereby diminishing the expected benefit to the company from capacity reductions 

additional security requirements may increase the company’s costs and decrease its revenues and traffic 

since september 11 2001 the dhs and the transportation security administration have implemented numerous security measures that affect airline operations and costs and are likely to implement additional measures in the future in addition foreign governments have also instituted additional security measures at foreign airports united serves a substantial portion of the costs of these security measures is borne by the airlines and their passengers increasing the company’s costs andor reducing its revenue and traffic additional measures taken to enhance either passenger or cargo security procedures andor to recover associated costs in the future may result in similar adverse effects on united’s results of operations 

extensive government regulation could increase the company’s operating costs and restrict its ability to conduct its business 

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that result in significant costs in addition to the enactment of the aviation and transportation security act laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce airline revenue the faa from time to time also issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require significant expenditures by united the company expects to continue incurring material expenses to comply with the regulations of the faa and other agencies 

united operates under a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the dot if the dot altered amended modified suspended or revoked our certificate it could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business the faa can also limit united’s airport access by limiting the number of departure and arrival slots at high density traffic airports and local airport authorities may have the ability to control access to certain facilities or the cost of access to such facilities which could have an adverse effect on the company’s business 

in addition access to landing and takeoff rights or “slots” at several major us airports and many foreign airports served by united are or recently have been subject to government regulation as passenger travel has continued to increase in recent years many us and foreign airports have become increasingly congested certain of united’s major hubs are among the more congested airports in the united states and have been or could be the subject of regulatory action that might limit the number of flights andor increase costs of operations at certain times or throughout the day 

in addition the company’s operations may be adversely impacted due to the existing outdated air traffic control “atc” system utilized by the us government during peak travel periods in certain markets the current atc system’s inability to handle existing travel demand has led to shortterm capacity constraints imposed by government agencies as discussed above and has also resulted in delays and disruptions of air traffic in addition the current system will not be able to effectively handle projected future air traffic growth therefore imposition of these atc constraints on a longterm basis may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations failure to update the atc system in a timely manner and the substantial funding requirements of a modernized atc system that may be imposed on carriers like united may have an adverse impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

the company has been subject to federal state and local taxes and fees that increase the cost of the company’s operations in addition to taxes and fees that the company is currently subject to proposed taxes and fees are currently pending if any of these additional taxes and fees were to be imposed on the company they would increase the company’s operating expenses 

  

many aspects of united’s operations are also subject to increasingly stringent federal state and local laws protecting the environment future environmental regulatory developments such as in regard to climate change in the united states and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in the airline industry some climate change laws and regulations that have gone into effect apply to united including environmental taxes for certain international flights including the united kingdom’s air passenger duty limited greenhouse gas reporting requirements and landbased planning laws which could apply to airports and could affect airlines in certain circumstances other areas of developing regulations include the state of california rulemaking regarding air emissions from ground support equipment and federal rulemakings concerning the discharge of deicing fluid and the regulation of aircraft drinking water supplies in addition a 2009 eu directive required eu member countries to enact legislation that would include aviation within the eu’s existing carbon emissions trading scheme effective in 2012 the legality of applying such a scheme to noneu airlines has been widely questioned in december 2009 the air transportation association joined by united continental and american airlines filed a lawsuit in the united kingdom challenging regulations that transpose into uk law the eu emissions trading scheme as applied to us carriers in addition noneu countries are considering filing a formal challenge before the united nations’ international civil aviation organization with respect to the eu’s inclusion of noneu carriers it is not clear whether the trading scheme would withstand such challenges if the scheme is found to be valid however it could significantly increase the costs of carriers operating in the eu by requiring the purchase of carbon credits although the precise cost to united is difficult to calculate with any certainty due to a number of variables and will depend among other things on united’s carbon emissions from flights to and from the eu and the price of carbon credits actions also may be taken in the future by the us government state governments within the united states foreign governments the international civil aviation organization or by signatory countries through a new global climate change treaty to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry the precise nature of any such requirements and their applicability to united are difficult to predict but the impact to the company and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant including the potential for increased fuel costs carbon taxes or fees or a requirement to purchase carbon credits 

the ability of us carriers to operate international routes is subject to change because the applicable arrangements between the united states and foreign governments may be amended from time to time or because appropriate slots or facilities may not be made available united currently operates on a number of international routes under government arrangements that limit the number of carriers capacity or the number of carriers allowed access to particular airports if an open skies policy were to be adopted for any of these routes such an event could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial position and results of operations and could result in the impairment of material amounts of related tangible and intangible assets in december 2009 the united states and japan entered into an open skies agreement which is currently expected to become effective in the fall of 2010 subject to certain conditions precedent being met to the extent the open skies agreement results in excess capacity relative to demand it could negatively impact the value of united’s usjapan business for example as competing carriers will be able to obtain open route rights from united states and japanese government authorities under the agreement the value of the company’s current routes from the united states to japan and beyond and slots related to these routes could be impaired in addition the value of the company’s business could be negatively impacted if a japanese air carrier enters into a revenue sharing joint venture alliance agreement with any of our principal competitors in the usjapan market which is possible under the open skies agreement 

the company’s plans to enter into or expand antitrust immunized joint ventures for various international regions involving continental united and other members of the star alliance are subject to receipt of approvals from applicable federal authorities or otherwise satisfying applicable regulatory requirements and there can be no assurances that such approvals will be granted or applicable regulatory requirements will be satisfied in december 2009 the company and continental applied jointly with all nippon airways to the dot for immunity from us antitrust laws for a series of alliance agreements between and among the carriers including a transpacific joint venture which is currently pending approval from the dot other air carriers are also seeking to initiate or expand antitrust immunity for joint ventures which if approved may adversely affect the company’s financial position and results of operations 

  

further the company’s operations in foreign countries are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in those countries the company cannot provide any assurance that current laws and regulations or laws or regulations enacted in the future will not adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations 

the company’s results of operations fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors associated with the airline industry 

due to greater demand for air travel during the spring and summer months revenues in the airline industry in the second and third quarters of the year are generally stronger than revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year the company’s results of operations generally reflect this seasonality but have also been impacted by numerous other factors that are not necessarily seasonal including among others the imposition of excise and similar taxes extreme or severe weather air traffic control congestion changes in the competitive environment due to industry consolidation and other factors and general economic conditions as a result the company’s quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year and historical operating results in a quarterly or annual period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 

the company may never realize the full value of its intangible assets or our longlived assets causing it to record impairments that may negatively affect its results of operations 

in accordance with applicable accounting standards the company is required to test its indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis on october 1 of each year or more frequently if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred in addition the company is required to test certain of its other assets for impairment if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred 

during the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 the company performed impairment tests of certain intangible assets and certain longlived assets principally aircraft related spare engines and spare parts the interim impairment tests were due to events and changes in circumstances that indicated an impairment might have occurred the primary factors deemed by management to have collectively constituted a potential impairment triggering event was in 2009 a significant decrease in actual and forecasted revenues and in 2008 record high fuel prices significant losses a softening us economy analyst downgrade of ual common stock rating agency changes in outlook for the company’s debt instruments from stable to negative the announcement of the planned removal from ual’s fleet of 100 aircraft and a significant decrease in the fair value of the ual’s outstanding equity and debt securities including a decline in ual’s market capitalization to significantly below book value 

as a result of the impairment testing described above the company recorded goodwill and tangible and intangible asset impairment charges of approximately 243 million and 26 billion during the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively the company determined that goodwill was completely impaired in 2008 however as of december 31 2009 the company had approximately 98 billion of operating property and equipment and 25 billion of intangible assets that could be subject to future impairment charges the company may be required to recognize additional impairments in the future due to among other factors extreme fuel price volatility tight credit markets a decline in the fair value of certain tangible or intangible assets unfavorable trends in historical or forecasted results of operations and cash flows and the uncertain economic environment as well as other uncertainties the company can provide no assurance that a material impairment charge of tangible or intangible assets will not occur in a future period the value of our aircraft could be impacted in future periods by changes in supply and demand for these aircraft such changes in supply and demand for certain aircraft types could result from grounding of aircraft by the company or other carriers an impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

  

the company’s initiatives to improve the delivery of its services to its customers reduce costs increase its revenues and increase shareholder value including the operational plans recently implemented by the company may not be adequate or successful 

the company continues to identify and implement improvement programs to enhance the delivery of its services to its customers reduce its costs and increase its revenues in response to the unprecedented increase in fuel prices during 2008 and the weakened us and global economies the company has been implementing certain operational plans in line with its “focus on five” operating agenda the company’s efforts are focused on cost savings in areas such as telecommunications airport services catering maintenance materials aircraft ground handling and regional affiliates expenses among others in addition the company significantly reduced mainline domestic and consolidated capacity and removed 100 aircraft from its mainline fleet including its entire b737 fleet of 94 aircraft and six b747 aircraft united eliminated its ted product and reconfigured that fleet’s 56 a320s to include united first class seats see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further information regarding the company’s capacity reductions the company will continue to review the deployment of all of our aircraft in various markets and the overall composition of our fleet to ensure that we are using our assets appropriately to provide the best available return in connection with the capacity reductions the company streamlined its operations and corporate functions in order to match the size of its workforce to the reduced size of its operations the company reduced its workforce by approximately 9000 positions during 2008 and 2009 through a combination of furloughs and furloughmitigation plans such as earlyout options there can be no assurance that the company’s initiatives to reduce costs and increase revenues will be successful 

the company is taking additional actions beyond the operational plans discussed above including increased cost reductions new revenue sources and other actions the company is also reviewing strategic alternatives to maximize the value of its assets and its businesses which may include a possible sale of all or part of these assets or operations there can be no assurance that any transactions with respect to these assets or operations will occur nor are there any assurances with respect to the form or timing of any such transactions or their actual effect on shareholder value a number of the company’s ongoing initiatives involve significant changes to the company’s business that it may be unable to implement successfully in addition revenue and other initiatives may not be successful due to the competitive landscape of the industry and the reaction of our competitors to certain of our initiatives the adequacy and ultimate success of the company’s programs and initiatives to improve the delivery of its products and services to its customers reduce its costs and increase both its revenues and shareholder value cannot be assured 

union disputes employee strikes and other laborrelated disruptions may adversely affect the company’s operations and impair its financial performance 

approximately 82 of the employees of ual are represented for collective bargaining purposes by us labor unions these employees are organized into six labor groups represented by six different unions 

relations between air carriers and labor unions in the united states are governed by the rla under the rla a carrier must maintain the existing terms and conditions of employment following the amendable date through a multistage and usually lengthy series of bargaining processes overseen by the nmb this process continues until either the parties have reached agreement on a new collective bargaining agreement or the parties are released to “selfhelp” by the nmb although in most circumstances the rla prohibits strikes shortly after release by the nmb carriers and unions are free to engage in selfhelp measures such as strikes and lockouts all six of the company’s us labor agreements became amendable in january 2010 and negotiations between the company and all labor unions commenced in april 2009 the company has filed for mediation assistance with respect to the negotiations with four of its six unions and all four unions are now in active mediation the company anticipates that the mediation process and the other two ongoing negotiations will continue in 2010 the company can provide no assurance that a successful or timely resolution of labor negotiations for all amendable agreements will be achieved there is also a risk that dissatisfied employees either with or without union involvement could engage in illegal slowdowns work stoppages partial work stoppages sickouts or 

  

other actions short of a full strike that could individually or collectively harm the operation of the airline and materially impair its financial performance 

increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage may adversely impact the company’s operations and financial results 

the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 led to a significant increase in insurance premiums and a decrease in the insurance coverage available to commercial airlines accordingly the company’s insurance costs increased significantly and its ability to continue to obtain certain types of insurance remains uncertain the company has obtained thirdparty war risk terrorism insurance through a special program administered by the faa resulting in lower premiums than if it had obtained this insurance in the commercial insurance market should the government discontinue this coverage obtaining comparable coverage from commercial underwriters could result in substantially higher premiums and more restrictive terms if it is available at all if the company is unable to obtain adequate war risk insurance its business could be materially and adversely affected 

if any of united’s aircraft were to be involved in an accident the company could be exposed to significant liability the insurance it carries to cover damages arising from any future accidents may be inadequate if the company’s insurance including but not limited to aviation hull and liability insurance and property insurance is inadequate it may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident 

the company relies heavily on automated systems to operate its business and any significant failure of these systems could harm its business 

the company depends on automated systems to operate its business including its computerized airline reservation systems flight operations systems telecommunication systems and commercial websites including wwwunitedcom  united’s website and reservation systems must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic and deliver important flight and schedule information as well as process critical financial transactions substantial or repeated website reservations systems or telecommunication systems failures could reduce the attractiveness of united’s services versus its competitors and materially impair its ability to market its services and operate its flights 

the company’s business relies extensively on thirdparty providers failure of these parties to perform as expected or unexpected interruptions in the company’s relationships with these providers or their provision of services to the company could have an adverse effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations 

the company has engaged a growing number of thirdparty service providers to perform a large number of functions that are integral to its business such as operation of united express flights operation of customer service call centers provision of information technology infrastructure and services provision of aircraft maintenance and repairs provision of various utilities and performance of aircraft fueling operations among other vital functions and services the company does not directly control these thirdparty providers although it does enter into agreements with many of them that define expected service performance any of these thirdparty providers however may materially fail to meet their service performance commitments to the company the failure of these providers to adequately perform their service obligations or other unexpected interruptions of services may reduce the company’s revenues and increase its expenses or prevent united from operating its flights and providing other services to its customers in addition the company’s business and financial performance could be materially harmed if its customers believe that its services are unreliable or unsatisfactory 

the company’s high level of fixed obligations could limit its ability to fund general corporate requirements and obtain additional financing could limit its flexibility in responding to competitive developments and could increase its vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions 

the company has a significant amount of financial leverage from fixed obligations including its amended credit facility aircraft lease and debt financings leases of airport property and other facilities and other 

  

material cash obligations in addition as of december 31 2009 the company had pledged a substantial amount of its assets as collateral to secure its various fixed obligations the company’s high level of fixed obligations a downgrade in the company’s credit ratings poor credit market conditions and the company’s limited amount of unencumbered assets available as collateral for loans or other indebtedness could impair the company’s ability to obtain additional financing if needed and reduce its flexibility to conduct its business certain of the company’s existing indebtedness also require it to meet covenants and financial tests to maintain ongoing access to those borrowings see note 11 “debt obligations and card processing agreements” and note 21 “subsequent events” in the footnotes for further details related to the company’s credit agreements and assets pledged as collateral as well as additional debt issued during early 2010 a failure to timely pay its debts or other material uncured breaches of its contractual obligations could result in a variety of adverse consequences including the acceleration of the company’s indebtedness the withholding of credit card sale proceeds by its credit card service providers and the exercise of other remedies by its creditors and equipment lessors that could result in material adverse effects on the company’s financial position and results of operations in such a situation it is unlikely that the company would be able to fulfill its obligations to repay the accelerated indebtedness make required lease payments or otherwise cover its fixed costs 

the company’s net operating loss carry forward may be limited or possibly eliminated 

as of december 31 2009 the company had a net operating loss “nol” carry forward tax benefit of approximately 27 billion for federal and state income tax purposes which will expire over a five to twenty year period this tax benefit is mostly attributable to federal pretax nol carry forwards of 73 billion if the company were to have a change of ownership within the meaning of section 382 of the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” under certain conditions its annual federal nol utilization could be limited to an amount equal to its market capitalization at the time of the ownership change multiplied by the federal longterm tax exempt rate adjusted for certain builtin gains or losses a change of ownership under section 382 of the code is defined as a cumulative change of more than 50 percentage points or more in the ownership positions of certain stockholders owning 5 or more of ual’s common stock over a three year rolling period 

to reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect on the company’s ability to utilize its nol carry forwards for federal income tax purposes ual’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains a 5 ownership limitation the “5 ownership limitation” applicable to all stockholders except the pension benefit guaranty corporation “pbgc” the 5 ownership limitation remains effective until february 1 2011 subject to further extension by the ual board of directors the “board of directors” and shareholders the 5 ownership limitation prohibits i the acquisition by a single stockholder of shares representing 5 or more of the common stock of ual and ii any acquisition or disposition of common stock by a stockholder that already owns 5 or more of ual’s common stock unless prior written approval is granted by the board of directors the percentage ownership of a single stockholder can be computed by dividing the number of shares of common stock held by the stockholder by the sum of the shares of common stock issued and outstanding plus the number of shares of common stock still held in reserve for payment to unsecured creditors under the debtors’ second amended joint plan of reorganization pursuant to chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code the “plan of reorganization” for additional information regarding the 5 ownership limitation please refer to ual’s restated certificate of incorporation available on its website 

while the purpose of these transfer restrictions is to prevent a change of ownership from occurring within the meaning of section 382 of the code which ownership change might materially and adversely affect the company’s ability to utilize its nol carry forward or other tax attributes no assurance can be given that such an ownership change will not occur in which case the availability of the company’s substantial nol carry forward and other federal income tax attributes might be significantly limited or possibly eliminated any transfers of common stock that are made in violation of the restrictions set forth above will be void and pursuant to ual’s restated certificate of incorporation will be treated as if such transfer never occurred this provision may prevent a sale of common stock by a stockholder and adversely affect the price at which a stockholder can 

  

sell common stock in addition this limitation may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of ual creating a perception that a change in control cannot occur or otherwise discouraging takeover attempts that some stockholders may consider beneficial which could also adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock ual cannot predict the effect that this provision in the ual amended and restated certificate of incorporation may have on the market price of the common stock 

in addition under the terms of the company’s 45 senior limitedsubordination convertible notes due 2021 the “45 notes” 5 senior convertible notes due 2021 the “5 notes” and 6 senior convertible notes due 2029 the “6 senior convertible notes” collectively the “notes” noteholders have the option to require ual to repurchase the notes on certain dates ual may pay the repurchase price in cash shares of ual common stock or a combination thereof if ual is required to repurchase such notes and elects to use shares of common stock rather than cash a change in ownership within the meaning of section 382 of the code could occur depending on the number of notes repurchased and the number of shares of ual common stock required to repurchase the notes further under the terms of the 45 notes 5 notes and 6 senior convertible notes noteholders have the option to convert the notes into shares of ual’s common stock at a fixed conversion rate at any time prior to maturity the conversion of a significant number of the notes into ual common stock could in combination with the shares if any used to repurchase the notes or other transactions cause a change in ownership within the meaning of section 382 of the code to occur 

the company is subject to economic and political instability and other risks of doing business globally 

the company is a global business with operations outside of the united states from which it derives approximately onethird of its operating revenues as measured and reported to the dot the company’s operations in asia latin america the middle east and europe are a vital part of its worldwide airline network volatile economic political and market conditions in these international regions may have a negative impact on the company’s operating results and its ability to achieve its business objectives in addition significant or volatile changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies and the imposition of exchange controls or other currency restrictions may have a material adverse impact upon the company’s liquidity revenues costs and operating results 

the company could be adversely affected by an outbreak of a disease that affects travel behavior 

an outbreak of a disease that affects travel demand or travel behavior such as severe acute respiratory syndrome avian flu or h1n1 virus or other illness could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

certain provisions of ual’s governance documents could discourage or delay changes of control or changes to the board of directors 

certain provisions of the restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws of ual together the “governance documents” may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the board of directors and may discourage takeover attempts that some of its stockholders may consider beneficial 

certain provisions of the governance documents may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if the board of directors determines that such changes in control are not in the best interests of ual and its stockholders 

these provisions of the governance documents are not intended to prevent a takeover but are intended to protect and maximize the value of ual’s stockholders’ interests while these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of ual to negotiate with the board of directors they could enable the board of directors to prevent a transaction that some or a majority of its stockholders might believe to be in their best interests and in that case may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

  

the issuance of ual’s contingent senior unsecured notes could adversely impact results of operations liquidity and financial position and could cause dilution to the interests of its existing stockholders 

in connection with the company’s plan of reorganization ual is obligated under an indenture to issue to the pbgc 8 contingent senior notes the “8 notes” with an aggregate principal amount of up to 500 million in up to eight equal tranches of 625 million with no more than two tranches issued as a result of each issuance trigger event upon the occurrence of certain financial triggering events an issuance trigger event occurs when among other things the company’s ebitdar as defined in the pbgc indenture exceeds 35 billion over the prior twelve months ending june 30 or december 31 of any applicable fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ended december 31 2009 and ending with the fiscal year ending december 31 2017 however if the issuance of a tranche would cause a default under any other securities then existing ual may satisfy its obligations with respect to such tranche by issuing ual common stock having a market value equal to 625 million the issuance of the 8 notes could adversely impact the company’s results of operations because of increased interest expense related to the notes and adversely impact its financial position or liquidity due to increased cash required to meet interest and principal payments any common stock issued in lieu of debt will cause additional dilution to existing ual stockholders 

risks related to ual common stock 

the issuance of additional shares of ual common stock including upon conversion of its convertible notes could cause dilution to the interests of its existing stockholders 

during 2009 ual issued 345 million aggregate principal amount of 6 senior convertible notes previously ual issued 726 million of 45 notes and 150 million of 5 notes in connection with the company’s plan of reorganization holders of these securities may convert them into shares of ual’s common stock according to their terms see note 11 “debt obligations and card processing agreements” in the footnotes for further information regarding these instruments 

the ual restated certificate of incorporation authorizes up to one billion shares of common stock in certain circumstances ual can issue shares of common stock without stockholder approval in 2008 the board of directors approved the issuance of 200 million of ual common stock as part of an ongoing equity offering by the company the company completed this equity offering during 2009 which produced aggregate net proceeds of approximately 196 million after deducting related expenses in october 2009 ual sold an additional 190 million shares of ual common stock in a separate underwritten public offering generating net proceeds of 132 million in addition the board of directors is authorized to issue up to 250 million shares of preferred stock without any action on the part of ual’s stockholders the board of directors also has the power without stockholder approval to set the terms of any series of shares of preferred stock that may be issued including voting rights conversion rights dividend rights preferences over ual’s common stock with respect to dividends or if ual liquidates dissolves or winds up its business and other terms if ual issues preferred stock in the future that has a preference over its common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon its liquidation dissolution or winding up or if ual issues preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of its common stock the rights of holders of its common stock or the market price of its common stock could be adversely affected ual is also authorized to issue without stockholder approval other securities convertible into either preferred stock or in certain circumstances common stock in the future ual may decide to raise additional capital through offerings of its common stock securities convertible into its common stock or rights to acquire these securities or its common stock the issuance of additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into common stock could result in dilution of existing stockholders’ equity interests in ual issuances of substantial amounts of its common stock or the perception that such issuances could occur may adversely affect prevailing market prices for ual’s common stock and ual cannot predict the effect this dilution may have on the price of its common stock 

  

the issuance of ual common stock upon a noteholder’s exercise of its option to require ual to repurchase convertible notes could cause dilution to the interests of existing stockholders 

under the terms of the company’s 45 notes 5 notes and 6 senior convertible notes holders of such notes may require ual to purchase all or a portion of such notes at a repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of such notes plus accrued and unpaid interest on june 30 2011 and june 30 2016 in the case of the 45 notes february 1 2011 and february 1 2016 in the case of the 5 notes and october 15 2014 october 15 2019 and october 15 2024 in the case of the 6 senior convertible notes if a noteholder exercises such option ual may elect to pay the repurchase price in cash shares of its common stock or a combination thereof if ual elects to pay the repurchase price in shares of its common stock ual is obligated to deliver a number of shares of common stock equal to the repurchase price divided by an average price of ual common stock for a 20consecutive trading day period the number of shares issued could be significant if ual determines to pay the repurchase price in shares of its common stock such an issuance could cause significant dilution to the interests of its existing stockholders in addition if ual elects to pay the repurchase price in cash its liquidity could be adversely affected 

ual’s certificate of incorporation limits voting rights of certain foreign persons 

ual’s restated certificate of incorporation limits the total number of shares of equity securities held by persons who are not “citizens of the united states” as defined in section 40102a15 of title 49 united states code to no more than 249 of the aggregate votes of all equity securities outstanding this restriction is applied pro rata among all holders of equity securities who fail to qualify as “citizens of the united states” based on the number of votes the underlying securities are entitled to

air cargopassenger surcharge investigations 

in february 2006 the european commission the “commission” and the doj commenced an international investigation into what government officials described as a possible price fixing conspiracy relating to certain surcharges included in tariffs for carrying air cargo the doj issued a grand jury subpoena to united and the commission conducted an inspection at the company’s offices in frankfurt in june 2006 united received a second subpoena from the doj requesting information related to certain passenger pricing practices and surcharges applicable to international passenger routes we are cooperating fully united is considered a source of information for the doj investigation not a target 

separately united has received information requests regarding cargo pricing matters from the competition authorities in australia brazil japan korea and switzerland on december 18 2007 the commission issued a statement of objections to 26 companies including united the statement of objections presented evidence related to the utilization of fuel and security surcharges and the exchange of pricing information that the commission views as supporting the conclusion that an illegal pricefixing cartel had been in operation in the air cargo transportation industry united has provided written and oral responses vigorously disputing the commission’s allegations against the company on july 31 2008 state prosecutors in sao paulo brazil commenced criminal proceedings against eight individuals including united’s cargo manager for allegedly participating in cartel activity the company is actively participating in the defense of those allegations on january 4 2010 the economic law secretariat of brazil issued its opinion recommending that civil penalties be assessed against all parties being investigated including united to the administrative counsel of economic defense “cade” which will make a determination on the matter united will vigorously defend itself before the cade on december 15 2008 the new zealand commerce commission issued notices of proceeding and statements of claim to 13 airlines including united the company is currently preparing its response to these proceedings on october 28 2009 the korean fair trade commission issued an examiner’s report which omitted the company from its investigation thereby removing the company as a target of its cargo pricing investigation 

in addition to the government investigations united and other air cargo carriers were named as defendants in over ninety class action lawsuits alleging civil damages as a result of the purported air cargo pricing conspiracy those lawsuits were consolidated for pretrial activities in the united states federal court for the eastern district of new york on june 20 2006 united entered into an agreement with the majority of the private plaintiffs to dismiss united from the class action lawsuits in return for an agreement to cooperate with the plaintiffs’ factual investigation and united is no longer named as a defendant in the consolidated civil lawsuit the company is reviewing whether its receipt of a statement of objections from the commission will impact the civil litigation 

multiple putative class actions were also filed alleging violations of the antitrust laws with respect to the passenger pricing practices which were the subject of the doj subpoena those lawsuits were consolidated for pretrial activities in the united states federal court for the northern district of california united was dismissed from the case on october 3 2008 

  

the company is currently cooperating with all ongoing investigations and analyzing whether any potential liability may result from any of the investigating bodies based on its evaluation of all information currently available the company has determined that no reserve for potential liability is required and will continue to defend itself against all allegations that it was aware of or participated in cartel activities however penalties for violation of competition laws can be substantial and an ultimate finding that the company engaged in improper activity could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

united injunction against alpa and four individual defendants for unlawful slowdown activity under the railway labor act 

on july 30 2008 united filed a lawsuit in federal court for the northern district of illinois the “court” seeking a preliminary injunction against alpa and four individual pilot employees also named as defendants for unlawful concerted activity which was disrupting the company’s operations the court granted the preliminary injunction to united in november 2008 which was upheld by the seventh circuit alpa and the company reached an agreement to discontinue the ongoing litigation over united’s motion for a permanent injunction and instead the preliminary injunction will remain in effect until the conclusion of the ongoing bargaining process for an amended collective bargaining agreement that began on april 9 2009 by reaching this agreement the parties are able to focus their efforts on the negotiations for the collective bargaining agreement nothing in this agreement precludes either party from reopening the permanent injunction litigation upon 30 days notice or from seeking enforcement of the preliminary injunction itself 

eeoc claim under the americans with disabilities act 

on june 5 2009 the us equal employment opportunity commission “eeoc” filed a lawsuit on behalf of five named individuals and other similarly situated employees alleging that united’s reasonable accommodation policy for employees with medical restrictions does not comply with the requirements of the americans with disabilities act the company is investigating this matter and cannot assess its possible exposure at this time although the company intends to vigorously defend itself in connection with this lawsuit the law in this area is unsettled and as a result there can be no assurances as to the ultimate result of this action 

litigation associated with september 11 2001 terrorism 

families of 94 victims of the september 11 terrorist attacks filed lawsuits asserting a variety of claims against the airline industry united and american airlines the “aviation defendants” as the two carriers whose flights were hijacked are the central focus of the litigation but a variety of additional parties have been sued on a number of legal theories ranging from collective responsibility for airport screening and security systems that allegedly failed to prevent the attacks to faulty design and construction of the world trade center towers in excess of 97 of the families of the deceased victims received awards from the september 11 th victims compensation fund of 2001 which was established by the federal government and consequently are now barred from making further claims against the aviation defendants world trade center properties inc as lessee has filed claims against the aviation defendants and the port authority of new york and new jersey the “port authority” the owner of the world trade center the port authority has also filed crossclaims against the aviation defendants in both the wrongful death litigation and for property damage sustained in the attacks the insurers of various tenants at the world trade center have filed subrogation claims for damages as well in the aggregate september 11 th claims are estimated to be well in excess of 10 billion by statute these matters were consolidated in the us district court for the southern district of new york and the aviation defendants’ exposure was capped at the limit of the liability coverage maintained by each carrier at the time of the attacks in the personal injury and wrongful death matters settlement discussions continue and the parties have reached settlement agreements for the majority of the remaining claims the company anticipates that any liability it may face arising from the events of september 11 2001 could be significant but by statute will be limited to the amount of its insurance coverage 

  

other legal proceedings 

ual and united are involved in various other claims and legal actions involving passengers customers suppliers employees and government agencies arising in the ordinary course of business additionally from time to time the company becomes aware of potential noncompliance with applicable environmental regulations which have either been identified by the company through internal compliance programs such as its environmental compliance audits or through notice from a governmental entity in some instances these matters could potentially become the subject of an administrative or judicial proceeding and could potentially involve monetary sanctions after considering a number of factors including but not limited to the views of legal counsel the nature of contingencies to which the company is subject and prior experience management believes that the ultimate disposition of these contingencies will not materially affect its consolidated financial position or results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

this annual report on form 10k is a combined report of ual and united including their respective consolidated financial statements as ual consolidates united for financial statement purposes disclosures that relate to activities of united also apply to ual unless otherwise noted united’s operating revenues and operating expenses comprise nearly 100 of ual’s revenues and operating expenses in addition united comprises approximately the entire balance of ual’s assets liabilities and operating cash flows therefore the following qualitative discussion is applicable to both ual and united unless otherwise noted any significant differences between ual and united results are separately disclosed and explained united meets the conditions set forth in general instruction i1a and b of form 10k and is therefore filing this form 10k with the reduced disclosure format allowed under that general instruction 

  

as discussed above under item 1 business  the company derives virtually all of its revenues from airline related activities the most significant source of airline revenues is passenger revenues however mileage plus united cargo and united services are also major sources of operating revenues the airline industry is highly competitive and is characterized by intense price competition fare discounting by united’s competitors has historically had a negative effect on the company’s financial results because united has generally been required to match competitors’ fares to maintain passenger traffic future competitive fare adjustments may negatively impact the company’s future financial results one of the company’s most significant operating expenses is jet fuel jet fuel prices are extremely volatile and are largely uncontrollable by the company the company’s historical and future earnings have been and will continue to be significantly impacted by jet fuel prices 

the company continues to implement its “focus on five” business approach a comprehensive set of priorities that focuses on the fundamentals of running a good airline one that runs on time with clean planes and courteous employees delivers industryleading revenues and competitive costs and does so safely the goal of this approach is to enable united to achieve bestinclass safety performance exceptional customer satisfaction and experience and industryleading margin and cash flow during 2009 united’s positions with respect to certain key metrics reported by the dot improved significantly in addition to improvements in overall customer satisfaction scores united ranked number one in ontime performance for domestic scheduled flights for 2009 among the five largest global us based carriers as measured by the dot and as published in the air travel consumer report for 2009 the company also reduced unit costs through cost control initiatives and successfully completed a number of financing initiatives during 2009 to strengthen its liquidity and considerably reduce its nearterm scheduled debt payments 

recent developments the global recession created an extremely challenging environment for the company for most of 2008 and 2009 the airline industry experienced decreased demand for air travel which put pressure on the company’s operating cash reserves as well as its operating revenues despite challenging revenue conditions the company significantly reduced its yearoveryear operating expenses in addition to fuel price declines and reduced capacity the company’s commitment to cost reduction was a contributing factor to this reduction in operating expenses as presented in the table below the following table presents the unit cost of various components of total operating expenses and related yearoveryear changes 

 

  

 in addition to mitigate the negative impact of the global recession the company focused on implementing strategies during 2009 related to among other things capacity reductions fleet optimization revenue generation and airline alliances as discussed below

 the company also took certain actions to enhance its liquidity and minimize its financing costs during this challenging economic environment in 2009 the company’s liquidity initiatives generated unrestricted cash of more than 15 billion primarily from the issuance of ual common stock proceeds from new debt issuances and aircraft asset saleleaseback transactions see liquidity and capital resources—financing activities  below for additional information related to these transactions 

the company also made the following significant changes to its international route network 

 

   

  

  

 financial results the air travel business is subject to seasonal fluctuations historically the company’s revenues are better in the second and third quarters as compared to the first and fourth quarters of each year since its first and fourth quarter results normally reflect weaker travel demand in addition the company’s results of operations may be impacted by adverse weather air traffic control delays fuel price volatility and other factors in any period 

the table below presents certain financial statement items to provide an overview of the company’s financial performance for the three years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 the most significant contributors to the company’s net losses in 2009 and 2008 were the negative impact of the economic recession on revenues in 2009 and increased fuel prices and asset impairments in 2008 the table below also highlights that the company through its past and ongoing cost reduction initiatives was able to effectively manage costs in nonfuel and other areas although the benefits of these cost savings initiatives were not sufficient to offset in 2009 lower revenues due to the global recession and in 2008 the dramatic increase in fuel cost 

summary results of operations 

 

   

 

    ual recorded the following impairment and other charges as further discussed below during the year ended december 31 2009 and 2008 

 

 the income tax benefit in 2009 is related to the impairment and sale of certain indefinitelived intangible assets partially offset by the income tax effects of items recorded in other comprehensive income the income tax benefit in 2008 is related to the impairment and sale of certain indefinitelived intangible assets partially offset by the impact of an increase in state tax rates 

  

liquidity the following table provides a summary of the company’s total cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash at december 31 2009 and 2008 

 

 the increase in the company’s cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash balances was primarily due to a 22 billion improvement in cash flows from operations in 2009 as compared to 2008 and the significant liquidity initiatives described in recent developments above ual’s variation in cash flows from operations in the 2009 period as compared to the prior year was relatively consistent with its results of operations as further described below under results of operations  lower cash expenditures for fuel purchases were offset by lower cash receipts from the sale of passenger and cargo transportation in 2009 as compared to 2008 in 2009 the company received 160 million related to the future relocation of its o’hare cargo operations this cash receipt was classified as an operating cash inflow the company also received 35 million from lax as part of an agreement to vacate certain facilities decreases in the company’s fuel hedge collateral requirements also provided operating cash of approximately 955 million this benefit was substantially offset by approximately 730 million of net cash paid to counterparties for fuel derivative contract settlements and premiums during 2009 

the company expects its cash flows from operations and its available capital to be sufficient to meet its future operating expenses lease obligations and debt service requirements in the next twelve months however the company’s future liquidity could be impacted by increases or decreases in fuel prices fuel hedge collateral requirements inability to adequately increase revenues to offset high fuel prices softening revenues resulting from reduced demand failure to meet future debt covenants and other factors see liquidity and capital resources and item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  below for a discussion of these factors and the company’s significant operating investing and financing cash flows 

capital commitments the company’s capital purchase commitments of 622 million are for the purchase of property and equipment including commitments related to its international premium cabin enhancement program as of december 31 2009 the company had remaining capital commitments to complete international enhancements on 46 aircraft in addition the company has an option to purchase 42 a319 and a320 aircraft for 23 billion 

contingencies united has guaranteed 270 million of the city and county of denver colorado special facilities airport revenue bonds united air lines project series 2007a the “denver bonds” this guarantee replaces our prior guarantee of 261 million of bonds issued by the city and county of denver colorado in 1992 these bonds are callable by united the outstanding bonds and related guarantee are not recorded in the company’s financial statements however the related lease agreement is accounted for on a straightline basis resulting in a ratable accrual of the final 270 million payment over the lease term 

bankruptcy matters  on december 9 2002 ual united and 26 direct and indirect whollyowned subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions to reorganize its business under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code the company emerged from bankruptcy on february 1 2006 under the plan of reorganization that was approved by the bankruptcy court during the course of its chapter 11 proceedings the company successfully reached settlements with most of its creditors and resolved all claims pending in the bankruptcy case on december 8 2009 the bankruptcy court issued a final decree closing all bankruptcy cases against the company effective as of that date see note 13 “commitments contingent liabilities and uncertainties” in the footnotes for further information regarding bankruptcy matters 

legal and environmental the company has certain contingencies resulting from litigation and claims incident to the ordinary course of business management believes after considering a number of factors 

  

including but not limited to the information currently available the views of legal counsel the nature of contingencies to which the company is subject and prior experience that the ultimate disposition of the litigation and claims will not materially affect the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations when appropriate the company accrues for these matters based on its assessments of the likely outcomes of their eventual disposition the amounts of these liabilities could increase or decrease in the near term based on revisions to estimates relating to the various claims 

the company anticipates that if ultimately found liable its damages from claims arising from the events of september 11 2001 could be significant however the company believes that under the air transportation safety and system stabilization act of 2001 its liability will be limited to its insurance coverage 

the company continues to analyze whether any potential liability may result from air cargopassenger surcharge cartel investigations following the receipt of a statement of objections that the commission issued to 26 companies on december 18 2007 the statement of objections sets out evidence related to the utilization of fuel and security surcharges and exchange of pricing information that the commission views as supporting the conclusion that an illegal pricefixing cartel had been in operation in the air cargo transportation industry united has provided written and oral responses vigorously disputing the commission’s allegations against the company nevertheless united will continue to cooperate with the commission’s ongoing investigation based on its evaluation of all information currently available the company has determined that no reserve for potential liability is required and will continue to defend itself against all allegations that it was aware of or participated in cartel activities however penalties for violation of european competition laws can be substantial and a finding that the company engaged in improper activity could have a material adverse impact on its consolidated financial position and results of operations 

many aspects of united’s operations are subject to increasingly stringent federal state and local laws protecting the environment future environmental regulatory developments such as in regard to climate change in the us and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in the airline industry some climate change laws and regulations that have gone into effect apply to united including environmental taxes for certain international flights including the united kingdom’s air passenger duty limited greenhouse gas reporting requirements and landbased planning laws which could apply to airports and could affect airlines in certain circumstances other areas of developing regulations include the state of california rulemakings regarding air emissions from ground support equipment and federal rulemakings concerning the discharge of deicing fluid and the regulation of aircraft drinking water supplies in addition a 2009 eu directive required eu member countries to enact legislation that would include aviation within the eu’s existing carbon emissions trading scheme effective in 2012 the legality of applying such a scheme to noneu airlines has been widely questioned in december 2009 the air transportation association joined by united continental and american airlines filed a lawsuit in the united kingdom challenging regulations that transpose into uk law the eu emissions trading scheme as applied to us carriers in addition noneu countries are considering filing a formal challenge before the united nations’ international civil aviation organization with respect to the eu’s inclusion of noneu carriers it is not clear whether the emissions trading scheme will withstand such challenges if the scheme is found to be valid however it could significantly increase the costs of carriers operating in the eu by requiring the purchase of carbon credits although the precise cost to united is difficult to calculate with any certainty due to a number of variables and will depend among other things on united’s carbon emissions from flights to and from the eu and the price of carbon credits actions may be taken in the future by the us government state governments within the us foreign governments the international civil aviation organization or by signatory countries through a new global climate change treaty to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry the precise nature of any such requirements and their applicability to united are difficult to predict but the impact to the company and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant including the potential for increased fuel costs carbon taxes or fees or a requirement to purchase carbon credits 

see note 13 “commitments contingent liabilities and uncertainties” in the footnotes for further discussion of the above contingencies 

  

results of operations 

operating revenues 

2009 compared to 2008 

the table below illustrates the yearoveryear percentage change in ual and united operating revenues 

 

 the table below presents ual and united passenger revenues and selected operating data from our mainline segment broken out by geographic region and from our regional affiliates segment expressed as yearoveryear changes 

 

  

 consistent with the rest of the airline industry the company’s decline in prasm was driven by a precipitous decline in worldwide travel demand as a result of the severe global recession two factors had a distinct impact on united’s revenue during 2009 

first network composition played a role in overall unit revenue decline international markets in particular the pacific region experienced more significant unit revenue declines as compared to the other regions given united’s strong international network and its historic relative contribution to revenues the company’s revenues were disproportionately impacted by the contraction in travel demand in the pacific 

second while demand declined across all geographic regions premium and business demand declined more significantly than leisure demand as united’s business model is strongly aligned to serve premium and business travelers both internationally and domestically the decrease in travel by business travelers and the buydown from premium class to economy class by some business travelers caused a significant negative impact on our results of operations however in the fourth quarter of 2009 the company began to see signs of improvement as discussed below 

  

in light of the current poor economic environment these two factors—network composition and decline of premium and business demand—have had and may continue to have a negative impact on our results of operations 

in 2009 revenues for both mainline and regional affiliates were negatively impacted by yield decreases of 15 and 13 respectively as compared to 2008 the yield decreases were a result of the weak economic environment in 2009 and the economic factors discussed above mainline revenues were also negatively impacted by lower rpms which were largely driven by the company’s capacity reductions and by the severe global recession partially offsetting regional affiliates’ decrease in yield was a 13 increase in rpms driven by an 11 increase in capacity regional affiliates capacity increased as we adjusted the size of our aircraft and capacity across united’s total network to conform to market demand and fulfill prior contractual commitments 

although the impact of the global recession on the company’s international network as well as business and premium travel during late 2008 and 2009 was severe the company saw indicators of economic recovery during the fourth quarter of 2009 which accelerated as the quarter progressed while fourth quarter 2009 consolidated passenger unit revenues were down 52 yearoveryear this performance was a vast improvement from the double digit declines in prior quarters most importantly there was a much needed sequential progress during the quarter ending with modest growth in december signs of recovery were evident internationally as well as in premium cabin booking and corporate revenues 

in 2009 mainline and regional affiliate revenues benefited from an increase in ancillary revenues which includes bag fees and other unbundled services of approximately 141 million compared to 2008 for the full year of 2009 ancillary revenues totaled approximately 11 billion 

mainline and regional affiliate revenues were favorably impacted in 2009 by an adjustment of approximately 36 million related to certain tax accruals that were previously recorded as a reduction of revenue this adjustment was recorded as a result of new information received by the company related to these tax matters 

cargo revenues declined by 318 million or 37 in 2009 as compared to 2008 due to four key factors first united took significant steps to rationalize its capacity with reduced international capacity affecting a number of key cargo markets second as noted by industry statistical releases during 2009 virtually all carriers in the industry including united were sharply impacted by reduced air freight and mail volumes driven by lower recessionary demand with the resulting oversupply of cargo capacity putting pressure on industry pricing in nearly all markets some of the largest industry demand reductions occurred in the pacific cargo market where united has a greater cargo capacity as compared to the atlantic latin and domestic air cargo markets third lower fuel costs in 2009 also reduced cargo revenues through lower fuel surcharges on cargo shipments as compared to 2008 when historically high fuel prices occurred finally united historically one of the largest carriers of us international mail was impacted by lower mail volumes and pricing beginning in third quarter of 2009 arising from us international mail deregulation the deregulation moved pricing from regulated rates set by the dot to marketbased pricing as a result of a competitive bidding process towards the end of 2009 the company began to experience significant market stabilization and improvement in cargo industry demand and yields 

  

2008 compared to 2007 

the table below illustrates the yearoveryear percentage change in ual and united operating revenues 

 

 the 2007 special item of 45 million relates to an adjustment of the estimated obligation associated with certain bankruptcy administrative claims of which 37 million and 8 million relates to the mainline and regional affiliates segments respectively the table below presents selected ual and united passenger revenues and selected operating data from our mainline segment broken out by geographic region with an associated allocation of the special revenue item and from our regional affiliates segment expressed as yearoveryear changes 

 

  

 in 2008 revenues for both mainline and regional affiliates benefited from yield increases of 7 and 5 respectively as compared to 2007 the yield increases are due to industry capacity reductions and fare increases including fuel surcharges plus incremental revenues derived from ancillary revenue such as checked bag services however the benefit of higher yields was partially offset by 6 and 4 decreases in traffic for the mainline and regional affiliates segments respectively consolidated passenger revenues in 2008 included an unfavorable variance compared to 2007 that was partly due to the change in the mileage plus expiration policy for inactive accounts from 36 months to 18 months that provided a consolidated estimated annual benefit of 246 million in 2007 in addition the weak economic environment negatively impacted demand and passenger revenues particularly in the fourth quarter of 2008 

international prasm was up 2 yearoveryear with a related capacity increase of 1 while latin american prasm growth was strong at 9 yearoveryear it is not a significant part of united’s international network atlantic performance was driven by lower than average revenue growth in our london and germany markets largely due to industry capacity growth of approximately 13 in the us to london heathrow route 

  

and united’s 15 growth in germany these markets account for approximately 75 of our atlantic capacity the pacific region was impacted by 7 industry capacity growth between the us and chinahong kong which account for approximately 45 of united’s pacific capacity 

cargo revenues increased by 84 million or 11 in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to higher fuel surcharges and improved fleet utilization in addition revenues were higher due to increased volume associated with the us domestic mail contract which commenced in late april 2007 as well as filling new capacity in international markets a weaker dollar also benefited cargo revenues in 2008 as a significant portion of cargo services are contracted in foreign currencies however the company experienced a significant decline in cargo revenues in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to rationalization of international capacity falling demand for domestic and international air cargo as the global economy softened and lower fuel costs driving lower fuel surcharges decreased cargo revenues resulting from lower demand have a disproportionate impact on our operating results because cargo revenues typically generate higher margins as compared to passenger revenues 

other revenues decreased approximately 11 in 2008 as compared to 2007 this decrease was primarily due to lower jet fuel sales to third parties the decrease in third party fuel sales had a negligible impact on our operating margin because the associated cost of sales decreased by a similar amount in 2008 as compared to 2007 

operating expenses 

2009 compared to 2008 

as discussed in operating revenues above the company decreased increased mainline and regional affiliates capacity by 10 and 11 respectively in 2009 as compared to 2008 the mainline capacity reductions had a significantly favorable impact on certain of the company’s mainline operating expenses as further described below other significant fluctuations in the company’s operating expenses are also discussed below the table below includes data related to ual and united operating expenses 

 

 salaries and related costs decreased 538 million or 13 in 2009 as compared to 2008 the decrease was primarily due to the company’s reduced workforce in 2009 compared to 2008 the company had approximately 43700 average fulltime equivalent employees for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 49600 in the prior year a 73 million decrease in severance expense related to the company’s operational plans and a 92 million yearoveryear benefit due to changes in employee benefits expenses also contributed to the decrease 

  

in salaries and related costs salaries and related costs also decreased by 46 million due to the company’s success sharing program the company did not record any expense for this plan in 2009 partially offsetting these benefits were the impacts of average wage and benefit cost increases and a 38 million increase related to ontime performance bonuses paid to operations employee groups during 2009 which were not paid in 2008 

the decrease in jet fuel expense and regional affiliates expense was primarily attributable to decreased market prices for jet fuel as shown in the table below which presents the significant changes in mainline and regional affiliate jet fuel cost per gallon in 2009 as compared to 2008 lower mainline fuel consumption due to the capacity reductions also benefited mainline fuel expense in 2009 as compared to the prior year see note 12 “fair value measurements and derivative instruments” in the footnotes for additional details regarding gainslosses from settled positions and unrealized gains and losses at the end of the period derivative gainslosses are not allocated to regional affiliate fuel expense 

 

  

 nm not meaningful 

regional affiliates expense decreased 309 million or 10 during 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to a 458 million decrease in regional affiliates fuel cost the decrease in regional affiliates fuel cost was primarily due to a lower average price per gallon of regional affiliates jet fuel in 2009 as presented in the table above and was partially offset by increased fuel consumption as a result of the increase in regional affiliates capacity increased capacity agreement payments to regional affiliates as a result of increased capacity partially offset the net fuel benefit the regional affiliates operating income was 125 million in the 2009 period as compared to a loss of 150 million in the 2008 period regional affiliates operating results improved significantly on a yearoveryear basis as the benefits of increased traffic and lower fuel cost offset the yield decrease 

purchased services decreased 208 million or 15 in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to the company’s operating cost savings programs and lower variable costs associated with lower mainline capacity 

during 2009 aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs decreased by 131 million or 12 as compared to the prior year primarily due to a lower volume of engine and airframe maintenance expense as a result of the company’s early retirement of 100 aircraft from its operating fleet and the timing of maintenance on other fleet types 

  

landing fees and other rent increased 43 million or 5 in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to higher rates 

distribution expenses decreased 176 million or 25 in 2009 primarily due to lower passenger revenues on lower traffic and yields driving reductions in commissions credit card fees and gds fees as compared to 2008 the company has also implemented several operating cost savings programs for both commissions and gds fees which produced realized savings in the current year 

aircraft rent expense decreased by 63 million or 15 primarily as a result of the company’s operational plans to retire its entire fleet of b737 aircraft some of which were financed through operating leases 

cost of third party sales decreased by 42 million or 15 primarily due to reduced sales of engine maintenance services 

asset impairments and special items 

in 2009 the company recorded special charges of 27 million related to the final settlement of the lax municipal bond litigation 104 million primarily related to b737 aircraft lease terminations and 93 million related to the impairment of regional aircraft and nonoperating b737 and b747 aircraft in addition the company recorded a 150 million intangible asset impairment to decrease the value of united tradenames a significant factor resulting in the lower fair value of the tradenames was a decrease in estimated future revenues due to the weak economic environment and the company’s capacity reductions among other factors in 2008 the company incurred asset impairment charges of 26 billion as shown in the table below all special charges and impairments relate to the mainline segment and the nongoodwill impairment charges are classified within “other impairments and special items” in the company’s financial statements see note 3 “asset impairments and intangible assets” and note 12 “fair value measurements and derivative instruments” and in the footnotes for additional information 

 

 in 2009 other operating expenses decreased by 123 million or 11 as compared to 2008 due to the company’s cost savings initiatives and lower variable expenses due to reduced capacity in the 2009 period as compared to 2008 ual recorded a gain of 29 million for a litigation settlement resulting in a reduction of other operating expenses during 2008 

  

2008 compared to 2007 

the table below includes data related to ual and united operating expenses significant fluctuations are discussed below 

 

 the increase in aircraft fuel expense and regional affiliates expense was primarily attributable to increased market prices for crude oil and related fuel products as shown in table below which presents several key variances for mainline and regional affiliate aircraft fuel expense in 2008 as compared to 2007 

 

  

 salaries and related costs increased 50 million in 2008 the company’s costs in 2008 include increases in average wages and benefits expense as well as severance expense of 106 million due to the implementation of 

  

the company’s operating plans as more fully described in note 2 “company operational plans” in the footnotes  in addition the company recorded 87 million of expense in 2008 from certain benefit obligation adjustments which were primarily due to discount rate changes these negative impacts were partially offset by lower combined profit and success sharing expense in the 2008 period as compared to the yearago period due to the unfavorable financial results in 2008 as compared to 2007 in addition 2008 salaries and related costs benefited from the workforce reductions completed during the year 

regional affiliates expense increased 307 million or 10 in 2008 as compared to 2007 regional affiliates expense increased primarily due to a 342 million or 37 increase in regional affiliates fuel that was driven by an increase in market price for fuel as highlighted in the fuel table above the regional affiliates operating loss was 150 million in 2008 period as compared to income of 122 million in 2007 due to the aforementioned fuel impacts which could not be fully offset by higher ticket prices as regional affiliates revenues were only 1 higher in 2008 

the company’s purchased services increased 29 million or 2 in 2008 as compared to 2007 in 2008 purchased services included a charge of 26 million related to certain projects and transactions being terminated or indefinitely postponed in 2008 other areas of purchased services did not change significantly as compared to 2007 

aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs decreased 6 in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to a decrease in engine and airframe maintenance associated with the retirement of the company’s b737 fleet and more favorable engine maintenance contract rates 

depreciation expense in 2008 was adversely impacted by 34 million of accelerated depreciation primarily related to the retirement of certain b737 and b747 aircraft and related parts and a 20 million charge to increase the inventory obsolescence reserve this adverse impact was partially offset by reduced amortization expense in 2008 related to certain intangible assets that were fully amortized in 2007 

ual landing fees and other rent decreased 2 in 2008 due to a reduction in the amount of facilities rented associated with ongoing efforts to optimize our rented facilities consistent with our operational needs 

distribution expenses decreased 9 in 2008 as compared to 2007 largely due to the company’s reduction of some of its travel agency commission programs in 2008 resulting in an average commission rate reduction in addition the company’s lower passenger revenues due to its capacity reductions in 2008 contributed to the decrease in related distribution expenses 

cost of third party sales decreased 14 yearoveryear primarily due to a reduction in the cost of jet fuel sales as a result of a reduction in sales to third parties 

other operating expenses decreased 5 in 2008 as compared to 2007 this decrease was partly due to a 29 million litigationsettlement gain which was recorded in other operating expenses and decreases in several other expense categories which resulted from the company’s cost reduction program 

asset impairments and special items 

as described in the footnotes as of may 31 2008 the company performed an interim impairment test of its goodwill all intangible assets and certain of its longlived assets principally aircraft predelivery deposits aircraft and related spare engines and spare parts due to events and changes in circumstances during the first five months of 2008 that indicated an impairment might have occurred in addition the company also performed an impairment test of certain aircraft fleet types as of december 31 2008 because unfavorable market conditions for aircraft indicated potential impairment of value the company also performed annual indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing at october 1 2008 as a result of all of its 2008 impairment testing the 

  

company recorded asset impairment charges of 26 billion as presented in the table above under 2009 compared to 2008  see critical accounting policies and note 3 “asset impairments and intangible assets” in the footnotes for additional information including factors considered by management in concluding that triggering events which indicated potential impairment had occurred and additional details of assets impaired 

in addition lease termination and other charges of 25 million were recorded during 2008 which primarily relate to the accrual of future rents for the b737 leased aircraft that were removed from service and charges associated with the return of certain of these aircraft to their lessors 

the company recorded special operating expense credits of 44 million in 2007 these items have been classified as special because they are directly related to the resolution of bankruptcy administrative claims and are not indicative of the company’s ongoing financial performance special items in the year ended december 31 2007 included a 30 million benefit due to the reduction in recorded accruals for bankruptcy litigation related to our sfo and lax municipal bond obligations and a 14 million benefit due to the company’s ongoing efforts to resolve certain other bankruptcy preconfirmation contingencies the 2007 special items resulted from revised estimates of the probable amount to be settled by the bankruptcy court see note 13 “commitments contingent liabilities and uncertainties” and note 18 “special items” in the footnotes for further information on these special items and bankruptcy matters 

other income expense 

2009 compared to 2008 

the following table illustrates the yearoveryear dollar and percentage changes in ual and united other income expense 

 

 ual interest expense increased 6 million or 1 in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to increased borrowing partially offset by lower interest rates on the company’s variablerate borrowings the decrease in interest expense was more than offset by a 93 million decrease in interest income primarily due to reduced investment yields resulting from lower market rates 

the hedge losses included in miscellaneous net in the 2008 period were due to significant fuel price declines below the contractual prices in the company’s fuel hedge portfolio that existed during and at the end of 2008 the company’s fuel derivative gain in 2009 was less significant because the company did not have any significant derivative activity for hedges that are classified in miscellaneous net in 2009 other than settlement of contracts that existed at december 31 2008 as of december 31 2009 the company had no unsettled fuel derivative trades that are classified within miscellaneous net see note 12 “fair value measurements and derivative instruments” in the footnotes for further information related to fuel hedges 

  

2008 compared to 2007 

the following table illustrates the yearoveryear dollar and percentage changes in ual and united other income expense 

 

 ual interest expense decreased 133 million or 19 in 2008 as compared to 2007 the 2008 period was favorably impacted by 15 billion of total credit facility prepayments and the february 2007 credit facility amendment which lowered united’s interest rate on these obligations scheduled debt obligation repayments throughout 2008 and 2007 also reduced interest expense in 2008 as compared to 2007 lower benchmark interest rates on the company’s variablerate borrowings also reduced the company’s interest expense in 2008 as compared to 2007 interest expense in 2007 included the writeoff of 17 million of previously capitalized debt issuance costs associated with the february 2007 amended credit facility partial prepayment 6 million of financing costs associated with the february 2007 amendment and a gain of 22 million from a debt extinguishment the benefit of lower interest expense in 2008 was offset by a 145 million decrease in interest income due to lower average cash and shortterm investment balances and lower investment yields interest expense for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 includes 48 million and 43 million respectively of noncash interest expense related to the company’s retrospective adoption of new accounting principles related to convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion see liquidity and capital resources below for further details related to financing activities 

nonoperating fuel hedge gainslosses relate to hedging instruments that are not classified as economic hedges these net hedge gainslosses are presented separately in the table above for purposes of additional analysis these hedging gainslosses are due to favorableunfavorable movements in crude oil prices relative to the fuel hedge instrument terms see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note 12 “fair value measurements and derivative instruments” in the footnotes for further discussion of these hedges 

there were no significant investment gains or losses in 2008 as compared to 2007 during which the company recorded a 41 million gain on sale of an investment this gain resulted from the company’s sale of its 211 interest in aeronautical radio inc during 2007 

the 24 million variance in miscellaneous net is primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations in 2008 

income taxes 

in 2009 ual and united recorded a tax benefit of 17 million and 16 million respectively primarily due to the impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets partially offset by income tax effects of items recorded in 

  

other comprehensive income the tax benefit recorded in 2008 is related to the impairment and sale of certain indefinitelived intangible assets partially offset by the impact of an increase in state tax rates ual recorded income tax expense of 297 million for the year ended december 31 2007 an effective tax rate of 455 see note 7 “income taxes” in the footnotes for additional information 

liquidity and capital resources 

as of the date of this form 10k the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to fund its operations for the next twelve months including liquidity for scheduled repayments of debt and capital lease obligations capital expenditures cash deposits required under fuel hedge contracts and other contractual obligations we expect to meet our liquidity needs in 2010 primarily from cash flows from operations cash and cash equivalents on hand and proceeds from the 2010 financing arrangements described below in addition the company may be able to generate a limited amount of liquidity from other sources including proceeds from aircraft sales and sales of other assets and potentially new financing arrangements while the company expects to meet its future cash requirements in 2010 our ability to do so could be impacted by many factors including but not limited to the following 

 

  

  

  

  

   

although the factors described above may adversely impact the company’s liquidity the company believes it has an adequate available cash position together with other sources of cash to fund current operations ual’s unrestricted and restricted cash balances were 30 billion and 341 million respectively at december 31 2009 in addition the company has recently taken actions to improve its liquidity and reduce nearterm obligations and believes it may access additional capital in the future as described below 

 

  

  

 cash position and liquidity as of december 31 2009 approximately 25 of the company’s cash and cash equivalents were invested in money market funds that primarily invest in us treasury securities and the remainder was invested in aaarated money market funds there are no withdrawal restrictions at the present time on any of the money market funds in which the company has invested we believe credit risk is limited with respect to our money market fund investments the following table provides a summary of ual’s net cash provided used by operating investing and financing activities for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 and total cash position as of december 31 2009 and 2008 

 

  

 the company’s cash position represents an important source of liquidity the change in cash from 2007 to 2009 is explained below restricted cash primarily represents cash collateral to secure workers’ compensation obligations cash collateral received from fuel derivative counterparties to secure their obligations security deposits for airport leases and reserves with institutions that process our credit card ticket sales we may be required to post significant additional cash collateral to meet such obligations in the future the company has a 255 million revolving commitment under its amended credit facility of which 254 million had been used for letters of credit as of both december 31 2009 and 2008 in addition under a separate agreement the company had 20 million of letters of credit issued as of december 31 2009

2009 compared to 2008 

ual’s cash from operations increased by 22 billion in 2009 as compared to the prior year this improvement was partly due to decreased cash required for aircraft fuel purchases as consolidated fuel purchase 

  

costs decreased by 41 billion in 2009 as compared to 2008 decreases in the company’s fuel hedge collateral requirements also provided operating cash of approximately 955 million in 2009 as compared to a use of cash of 965 million in 2008 in addition the company received 160 million during 2009 related to the future relocation of its o’hare cargo facility as further discussed in note 14 “lease obligations” in the footnotes 

these operating cash flow benefits were partially offset by a decrease in operating cash flow due to lower sales which decreased by 39 billion in 2009 as discussed in results of operations above and approximately 730 million of payments to counterparties for fuel derivative contract settlements and premiums in addition the company did not have a significant advance sale of miles in 2009 resulting in an unfavorable variance as compared to 2008 during which the company received 600 million from the company’s advanced sale of miles and license agreement with its cobranded credit card partner as discussed below 

in 2009 the company contributed approximately 245 million and 18 million to its defined contribution plans and nonus pension plans respectively as compared to contributions of 240 million and 22 million respectively in 2008 

2008 compared to 2007 

ual’s cash from operations decreased by 34 billion in 2008 as compared to 2007 this decrease was primarily due to the increased cash required for fuel purchases and operating and nonoperating cash fuel hedge losses mainline and regional affiliates fuel costs increased 31 billion in 2008 over 2007 and nonoperating expenses also increased over the same period largely due to cash and noncash fuel hedge losses in addition certain counterparties to our fuel hedge instruments required the company to provide cash collateral deposits of approximately 965 million in 2008 which negatively impacted our cash flows during 2008 as compared to 2007 when no similar deposits were required a decrease in advance ticket sales also negatively impacted operating cash flow in 2008 partially offsetting the negative impacts were 500 million of proceeds from the advanced purchase of miles by our cobranded credit card partner as part of the amendment of our marketing agreement and 100 million of proceeds from the extension of the license previously granted to our cobranded credit card partner to be the exclusive issuer of mileage plus visa cards through 2017 in 2008 the company contributed approximately 240 million and 22 million to its defined contribution plans and nonus pension plans respectively as compared to contributions of 236 million and 14 million respectively in 2007 for these plans 

cash flows from investing activities 

2009 compared to 2008 

the sale of 23 billion of shortterm investments throughout 2008 generated significant investing cash flows in 2008 as compared to 2009 as discussed below these investments were sold as part of the company’s shift to invest available cash into money market funds ual’s capital expenditures which included capitalized interest were 317 million and 475 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively capital expenditures decreased significantly in the 2009 period as compared to 2008 because the company only acquired one aircraft in 2009 as compared to ten aircraft acquired during 2008 in addition the company limited its spending in 2009 by focusing its capital resources only on its highestvalue projects the 2009 and 2008 aircraft acquisitions were completed pursuant to existing lease terms using prefunded lease deposits as described below in cash flows from financing activities  

in 2009 the company received 175 million from three saleleaseback agreements these transactions were accounted for as capital leases resulting in an increase to capital lease assets and capital lease obligations during 2009 the 2008 period included proceeds of 274 million from one saleleaseback transaction other asset sales including airport slot sales generated proceeds of 78 million and 94 million during 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  

2008 compared to 2007 

net sales of shortterm investments provided cash of 23 billion for ual in 2008 as compared to cash used for net purchases of shortterm investments of 20 billion in 2007 in 2008 the company invested most of its excess cash in money market funds whereas in 2007 excess cash was largely invested in shortterm investments such as commercial paper during 2008 the company also received 357 million of cash that was previously restricted cash held by the company’s largest credit card processor and was released as a part of an amendment to the company’s agreement with this processor see credit card processing agreements  below for further discussion of the amended agreement and future cash reserve requirements 

in 2008 cash expenditures for property equipment and software totaled approximately 475 million additions to property in 2008 included 20 million of capitalized interest in 2007 cash expenditures for property and equipment software and capitalized interest were 639 million 65 million and 19 million respectively this yearoveryear decrease is primarily due to the company’s efforts to optimize its available cash and a reduction in cash used to acquire aircraft as the 2007 capital expenditures included cash used to acquire six aircraft that were previously financed as operating leases 

during 2008 the company generated 94 million from various asset sales including the sale of five b737 aircraft spare parts engines and slots investing cash of 274 million was generated from aircraft sold under saleleaseback financing agreements in 2008 united entered into a 125 million saleleaseback involving nine previously unencumbered aircraft and a 149 million saleleaseback involving 15 aircraft see note 14 “lease obligations” and note 15 “statement of consolidated cash flows—supplemental disclosures” in the footnotes for additional information related to these transactions in addition the company’s investing cash flows benefited from 41 million of cash proceeds from a litigation settlement that resulted in the recognition of a 29 million gain during 2008 the litigation settlement related to predelivery advance aircraft deposits 

cash flows from financing activities 

2009 activity 

in 2009 the company generated gross proceeds of approximately 900 million from the following debt issuances 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition in 2009 the company generated net proceeds of 222 million from the following equity issuances 

 

   

 the proceeds from these transactions were partially offset by 984 million used for scheduled longterm debt and capital lease payments during 2009 as well as 49 million used for payment of various costs associated with the financing activities discussed above 

2008 activity 

ual used 253 million for its special distribution to common stockholders united issued a 257 million dividend to ual for this distribution and 919 million for scheduled longterm debt and capital lease payments united used cash of 109 million in connection with an amendment to its amended credit facility as further discussed below in 2008 the company acquired ten aircraft that were being operated under existing leases these aircraft were acquired pursuant to existing lease terms aircraft lease deposits of 155 million provided financing cash that was primarily utilized by the company to make the final payments due under these lease obligations 

united completed a 241 million credit agreement secured by 26 of the company’s currently owned and mortgaged a319 and a320 aircraft borrowings under the agreement were at a variable interest rate based on libor plus a margin the agreement requires periodic principal and interest payments through its final maturity in june 2019 the company may not prepay the loan prior to july 2012 this agreement did not change the number of the company’s unencumbered aircraft as the company used available equity in these previously owned and mortgaged aircraft as collateral for this financing 

united also entered into an 84 million loan agreement secured by three aircraft including two airbus a320 and one boeing b777 borrowings under the agreement were at a variable interest rate based on libor plus a margin the loan requires principal and interest payments every three months and has a final maturity in june 2015 

the company issued 112 million shares of ual common stock as part of a 200 million equity offering during 2008 as of december 31 2008 the company had generated net proceeds of 107 million from this offering 

see cash flows from investing activities above for a discussion of the company’s 2008 saleleaseback transactions 

2007 activity 

in 2007 the company made a 10 billion prepayment on its amended credit facility and made 11 billion of additional debt payments which included 590 million related to the early retirement of debt the company prepaid an additional 500 million of the amended credit facility in december 2007 in addition the company completed a 694 million debt issuance which effectively refinanced the aforementioned early debt retirement and refinanced three aircraft that had been previously financed through operating lease agreements 

in 2007 the company completed financing transactions totaling approximately 964 million which included 694 million related to the eetc secured financing and 270 million of denver bonds a portion of the proceeds of the 694 million eetc transaction was used to repay 590 million of debt obligations that were secured by ten previously mortgaged owned aircraft and to finance three previously unencumbered owned aircraft the proceeds from the denver bonds were used to refinance the former 261 million of denver series 1992a bonds 

in 2007 cash from aircraft lease deposits increased 80 million primarily due to the use of the deposits to purchase the three previously leased assets described above in cash flows from investing activities  this was reported as a financing cash inflow as the prepayment of the initial deposits were recorded as a financing cash outflow 

  

other financing matters 

secured notes offering in january 2010 the company issued 500 million aggregate principal amount of 9875 senior secured notes due 2013 the “senior secured notes” and 200 million aggregate principal amount of 120 senior second lien notes due 2013 the “senior second lien notes” the senior secured notes and senior second lien notes are secured by united’s route authority to operate between the united states and japan and beyond japan to points in other countries certain airport takeoff and landing slots and airport gate leaseholds utilized in connection with these routes among other covenants the indentures governing the senior secured notes and the senior second lien notes contain covenants related to the collateral including covenants requiring united subject to certain exceptions to maintain ownership of the collateral and to calculate the priority lien debt value ratio or secured debt value ratio as applicable and to maintain a minimum priority lien debt value ratio or minimum secured debt value ratio as applicable as of certain reference periods 

eetc financing in january 2010 the company issued the remaining principal amount of the equipment notes relating to the series 20091 and 20092 eetcs as discussed in 2009 activity above issuance proceeds of approximately 11 billion were used to repay the series 20002 and 20001 eetcs and for general corporate purposes the issuance of the 2009 eetcs resulted in a reduction in the company’s 2010 and 2011 debt obligations of approximately 440 million and 275 million respectively these financing activities resulted in approximately 250 million of incremental liquidity in 2010 

encumbered assets  as of december 31 2009 and 2008 a substantial portion of the company’s assets principally aircraft spare engines aircraft spare parts route authorities and mileage plus intangible assets were pledged under various loan and other agreements in january 2010 the company completed a debt offering secured by united’s route authorities to operate between the united states and japan and beyond japan to points in other countries certain airport takeoff and landing slots and airport gate leaseholds utilized in connection with these routes as a part of the offering united requested that these assets currently encumbered under the amended credit facility be released and substituted by replacement collateral consisting of aircraft spare engines primary slots at laguardia and washington reagan and flight simulators with an appraised value of approximately 830 million after the assets are released from the amended credit facility in april 2010 a balance of approximately 200 million in unencumbered assets will remain in addition the amended credit facility will include approximately 300 million of excess collateral that can be used for financing if needed subject to approval from the amended credit facility lenders see note 11 “debt obligations and card processing agreements” in the footnotes for additional information on assets provided as collateral by the company 

future financing subject to the restrictions of its amended credit facility and the notes the company could raise additional capital by issuing unsecured debt equity or equitylike securities monetizing or borrowing against certain assets or refinancing existing obligations to generate net cash proceeds however the availability and capacity of these funding sources cannot be assured or predicted general economic conditions poor credit market conditions the limited amount of unencumbered assets available as collateral for loans or other indebtedness and any adverse changes in the company’s credit ratings could adversely impact the company’s ability to raise capital if needed and could increase the company’s cost of capital 

credit ratings as of december 31 2009 the company had a corporate credit rating of b outlook negative from sp and a corporate family rating of “caa1” from moody’s investor services during 2009 fitch lowered ual’s issuer default rating to “ccc” from “b” these credit ratings are below investment grade levels downgrades from these rating levels among other things could restrict the availability andor increase the cost of future financing for the company 

other matters the company may from time to time make open market purchases of certain of its debt securities or other financing instruments depending on among other factors favorable market conditions and the company’s liquidity position 

  

amended credit facility covenants the company’s amended credit facility requires compliance with certain covenants the company was in compliance with all of its amended credit facility covenants as of december 31 2009 and 2008 in may 2008 the company amended the terms of certain financial covenants of the amended credit facility a summary of financial covenants after the may amendment is included below 

the company must maintain a specified minimum ratio of ebitdar to the sum of the following fixed charges for all applicable periods a cash interest expense and b cash aircraft operating rental expense ebitdar represents earnings before interest expense net of interest income income taxes depreciation amortization aircraft rent and certain other cash and noncash credits and charges as further defined by the amended credit facility the other adjustments to ebitdar include items such as foreign currency transaction losses increases in our deferred revenue obligation sharebased compensation expense nonrecurring or unusual losses any noncash nonrecurring charge or noncash restructuring charge a limited amount of cash restructuring charges certain cash transaction costs incurred with financing activities and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 

the amended credit facility also requires compliance with the following financial covenants i a minimum unrestricted cash balance as defined by the amended credit facility of 10 billion and ii a minimum collateral ratio of 150 at any time or 200 at any time following the release of the pacific narita china and hong kong and atlantic london heathrow routes together the “primary routes” having an appraised value in excess of 1 billion on the aggregate unless the primary routes are the only collateral then pledged in which case a minimum collateral ratio of 150 is required the minimum collateral ratio is calculated as the market value of collateral to the sum of a the aggregate outstanding amount of the loans plus b the undrawn amount of outstanding letters of credit plus c the unreimbursed amount of drawings under such letters of credit and d the termination value of certain interest rate protection and hedging agreements with the amended credit facility lenders and their affiliates 

as discussed above in connection with the issuance of the senior secured notes and the senior second lien notes in january 2010 certain assets currently encumbered under the amended credit facility are expected to be released and substituted by replacement collateral consisting of aircraft spare engines primary slots at laguardia and washington reagan and flight simulators with an appraised value of approximately 830 million the assets expected to be released consist of route authorities to operate between the united states and japan and beyond japan to points in other countries certain airport takeoff and landing slots and airport gate leaseholds utilized in connection with these routes and were used as collateral for the january 2010 offering 

the company’s requirement to meet the fixed charge coverage ratio is determined as set forth below 

 

 the amended credit facility contains a cross default provision with respect to final judgments that exceed 50 million although the company was in compliance with all required financial covenants as of december 31 2009 continued compliance depends on many factors some of which are beyond the company’s control including the overall industry revenue environment and the level of fuel costs there are no assurances that the company will continue to comply with its debt covenants failure to comply with applicable covenants in any reporting period would result in a default under the amended credit facility which could have a material adverse impact on the company depending on the company’s ability to obtain a waiver or amendment of such covenants or otherwise mitigate the impact of the default 

  

credit card processing agreements the company has agreements with financial institutions that process customer credit card transactions for the sale of air travel and other services under certain of the company’s card processing agreements the financial institutions either require or have the right to require that united maintain a reserve equal to a portion of advance ticket sales that have been processed by that financial institution but for which the company has not yet provided the air transportation referred to as “relevant advance ticket sales” as of december 31 2009 the company had total advance ticket sales of approximately 15 billion of which approximately 80 related to credit card sales 

the company’s credit card processing agreement with paymentech and jpmorgan chase bank na contains a cash reserve requirement in addition to certain other risk protections provided to the processor the amount of cash collateral reserve will be determined based on the amount of unrestricted cash held by the company as defined under the amended credit facility if the company’s unrestricted cash balance is at or more than 25 billion as of any calendar monthend measurement date its required reserve will remain at 25 million however if the company’s unrestricted cash is less than 25 billion its required reserve will increase to a percentage of relevant advance ticket sales as summarized in the following table 

 

  

 based on the company’s december 31 2009 unrestricted cash balance the company was not required to provide cash collateral above the current 25 million reserve balance 

united entered into a new agreement with american express on march 1 2009 which has an initial five year term under the agreement in addition to certain other risk protections provided to american express the company will be required to provide reserves based primarily on its unrestricted cash balance and net current exposure as of any calendar monthend measurement date as summarized in the following table 

 

  

  the agreement with american express permits the company to provide certain replacement collateral in lieu of cash collateral as long as the company’s unrestricted cash is above 135 billion such replacement collateral may be pledged for any amount of the required reserve up to the full amount thereof with the stated value of such collateral determined according to the agreement replacement collateral may be comprised of aircraft slots and routes real estate or other collateral as agreed between the parties based on the company’s unrestricted cash balance at december 31 2009 the company was not required to provide any reserves under this agreement 

an increase in the future reserve requirements as provided by the terms of either or both of the company’s material credit card processing agreements could materially reduce the company’s liquidity 

  

capital commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements the company’s business is very capital intensive requiring significant amounts of capital to fund the acquisition of assets particularly aircraft in the past the company has funded the acquisition of aircraft through outright purchase by issuing debt by entering into capital or operating leases or through vendor financings the company also often enters into longterm lease commitments with airports to ensure access to terminal cargo maintenance and other required facilities 

the table below provides a summary of ual’s material contractual obligations as of december 31 2009 

 

  

         

  see note 1i “summary of significant accounting policies—regional affiliates” note 8 “retirement and postretirement plans” note 11 “debt obligations and card processing agreements” and note 14 “lease obligations” in the footnotes for additional discussion of the items included in the table above 

offbalance sheet arrangements an offbalance sheet arrangement is any transaction agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has 1 made guarantees 2 a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets 3 an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or 4 any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to the company or that engages in leasing hedging or research and development arrangements with the company the company’s offbalance sheet arrangements include operating leases which are summarized in the contractual obligations table above and certain municipal bond obligations as discussed below and letters of credit of which 274 million were outstanding at december 31 2009 

certain municipalities have issued municipal bonds on behalf of united to finance the construction of improvements at airportrelated facilities the company also leases facilities at airports where municipal bonds funded at least some of the construction of airportrelated projects at december 31 2009 the company guaranteed interest and principal payments on 270 million in principal of denver bonds that were originally issued in 1992 subsequently refinanced in 2007 and are due in 2032 unless the company elects not to extend its lease in which case the bonds are due in 2023 the outstanding bonds and related guarantee are not recorded in the company’s financial statements because the related lease agreement is accounted for as an operating lease with the associated rent expense recorded on a straightline basis over the expected lease term through 2032 the annual lease payments through 2023 and the final payment for the principal amount of the denver bonds are included in the operating lease payments in the contractual obligations table above for further details see note 13 “commitments contingent liabilities and uncertainties—guarantees and offbalance sheet financing” in the footnotes 

fuel consortia the company participates in numerous fuel consortia with other carriers at major airports to reduce the costs of fuel distribution and storage interline agreements govern the rights and responsibilities of the consortia members and provide for the allocation of the overall costs to operate the consortia based on usage the consortia and in limited cases the participating carriers have entered into longterm agreements to lease certain airport fuel storage and distribution facilities that are typically financed through taxexempt bonds either special facilities lease revenue bonds or general airport revenue bonds issued by various local municipalities in general each consortium lease agreement requires the consortium to make lease payments in amounts sufficient to pay the maturing principal and interest payments on the bonds as of december 31 2009 approximately 12 billion principal amount of such bonds were secured by significant fuel facility leases in which united participates as to which united and each of the signatory airlines have provided indirect guarantees of the debt united’s exposure is approximately 214 million principal amount of such bonds based on its recent consortia participation the company’s exposure could increase if the participation of other carriers decreases the guarantees will expire when the taxexempt bonds are paid in full which ranges from 2010 to 2040 the company did not record a liability at the time these indirect guarantees were made 

  

other information 

foreign operations the company’s financial statements reflect material amounts of intangible assets related to the company’s pacific and latin american route authorities and its operations at london heathrow because operating authorities in international markets are governed by bilateral aviation agreements between the us and foreign countries changes in us or foreign government aviation policies can lead to the alteration or termination of existing air service agreements that could adversely impact and significantly impair the value of our international route authorities and other assets significant changes in such policies could also have a material impact on the company’s operating revenues and expenses and results of operations for further information see item 1 business—international regulation item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note 3 “asset impairments and intangible assets” in the footnotes for further information on the company’s foreign currency risks associated with its foreign operations 

critical accounting policies 

critical accounting policies are defined as those that are affected by significant judgments and uncertainties which potentially could result in materially different accounting under different assumptions and conditions the company has prepared the financial statements in conformity with gaap which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the footnotes actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions the company has identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of the financial statements 

passenger revenue recognition the value of unused passenger tickets and miscellaneous charge orders “mcos” is included in current liabilities as advance ticket sales united records passenger ticket sales and tickets sold by other airlines for use on united as operating revenues when the transportation is provided or when the ticket expires tickets sold by other airlines are recorded at the estimated values to be billed to the other airlines nonrefundable tickets generally expire on the date of the intended flight unless the date is extended by notification from the customer on or before the intended flight date fees charged in association with changes or extensions to nonrefundable tickets are recorded as passenger revenue at the time the fee is collected change fees related to nonrefundable tickets are considered a separate transaction from the air transportation because they represent a charge for the company’s additional service to modify a previous reservation therefore the pricing of the change fee and the initial customer reservation are separately determined and represent distinct earnings processes refundable tickets expire after one year mcos can be either exchanged for a passenger ticket or refunded after issuance united records an estimate of tickets that have been used but not recorded as revenue due to system processing errors as revenue in the month of sale based on historical results united also records an estimate of mcos that will not be exchanged or refunded as revenue ratably over the redemption period based on historical results due to complex industry pricing structures refund and exchange policies and interline agreements with other airlines certain amounts are recognized as revenue using estimates both as to the timing of recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized these estimates are based on the evaluation of actual historical results 

accounting for frequent flyer program miles sold to third parties and the advanced purchase of miles the company has an agreement with its cobranded credit card partner that requires its partner to purchase miles in advance of when miles will be awarded to the cobranded partner’s cardholders referred to as “prepurchased miles” the prepurchased miles are deferred when received by united in our financial statements as “advanced purchase of miles” the company amended its agreement with its cobranded credit card partner in 2008 see note 16 “advanced purchase of miles” in the footnotes for a description of this agreement and its 2008 amendment subsequently when the company’s credit card partner awards prepurchased miles to its cardholders the company transfers the related air transportation element for the awarded miles from “advanced purchase of miles” to “mileage plus deferred revenue” at estimated fair value and records the residual marketing element as “other operating revenue” the deferred revenue portion is then subsequently recognized as passenger revenue when transportation is provided in exchange for the miles awarded 

  

other frequent flyer accounting policies 

the company has adopted a deferred revenue measurement method to record the fair value of its frequent flyer obligation this method allocates an equivalent weightedaverage ticket value to each outstanding mile based upon projected redemption patterns for available award choices when such miles are consumed for miles sold to third parties the company recognizes revenue related to the air transportation and marketingrelated elements as follows 

air transportation element the company defers the portion of the sales proceeds that represents estimated fair value of the air transportation and recognizes that amount as revenue when transportation is provided the fair value of the air transportation component is determined based upon the equivalent ticket value of similar fares on united and amounts paid to other airlines for miles the initial revenue deferral is presented as “mileage plus deferred revenue” in the financial statements when recognized the revenue related to the air transportation component is classified as “passenger revenues” in the financial statements 

marketingrelated element the amount of revenue from the marketingrelated element is determined by subtracting the fair value of the air transportation from the total sales proceeds the residual portion of the sales proceeds related to marketing activities is recognized when miles are awarded this portion is recognized as “other operating revenues” in the financial statements 

the value of the deferred revenue is estimated assuming redemptions on both united and other participating carriers in the mileage plus program and by estimating the relative proportions of awards to be redeemed by class of service within broad geographic regions of the company’s operations including domestic atlantic pacific and latin america the estimation of the fair value of each award mile requires the use of several significant assumptions for which significant management judgment is required for example management must estimate how many miles are projected to be redeemed on united versus on other airline partners since the equivalent ticket value of miles redeemed on united and on other carriers can vary greatly this assumption can materially affect the calculation of the weightedaverage ticket value from period to period 

management must also estimate the expected redemption patterns of mileage plus customers who have a number of different award choices when redeeming their miles each of which can have materially different estimated fair values such choices include different classes of service first business and several coach award levels as well as different flight itineraries such as domestic and international routings and varied itineraries within domestic and international regions of united’s and other participating carriers’ route networks customer redemption patterns may also be influenced by program changes which occur from time to time and introduce new award choices or make material changes to the terms of existing award choices management must often estimate the probable impact of such program changes on future customer behavior management uses historical customer redemption patterns as the best single indicator of future redemption behavior in making its estimates but changes in customer mileage redemption behavior to patterns which are not consistent with historical behavior can result in material changes to deferred revenue balances and to recognized revenue 

the company measures its deferred revenue obligation using all awarded and outstanding miles regardless of whether or not the customer has accumulated enough miles to redeem an award eventually these customers accumulate enough miles to redeem awards or their accounts deactivate after a period of inactivity in which case the company recognizes the related revenue through its revenue recognition policy for expired miles 

the company recognizes revenue related to expected expired miles over the estimated redemption period based on analysis of mileage redemption and expiration patterns the company estimates that 24 of earned miles will expire or go unredeemed as of december 31 2009 and 2008 the company’s outstanding number of miles was approximately 4576 billion and 4782 billion respectively the company estimates that approximately 3491 billion of the outstanding miles at december 31 2009 will ultimately be redeemed based on assumptions as of december 31 2009 at december 31 2009 a hypothetical 1 change in the company’s outstanding number of miles or the weightedaverage ticket value has approximately a 41 million effect on the 

  

liability the company’s estimate of the expected expiration of miles requires significant management judgment current and future changes to expiration assumptions or to the expiration policy or to program rules and program redemption opportunities may result in material changes to the deferred revenue balance as well as recognized revenues from the program 

asset impairments 

the company recorded impairment charges during the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 as presented in the table below all of these impairment charges are within the mainline segment all of the impairments other than the goodwill impairment which is separately identified are classified within “other impairments and special items” in the financial statements 

 

 during 2009 the company performed interim and annual impairment tests of its intangible assets and certain of its longlived assets principally aircraft and related spare engines and spare parts due to events and changes in circumstances that indicated an impairment might have occurred the primary factors deemed by management to have constituted a potential impairment triggering event were a significant decline in unit revenues experienced in early 2009 and decreases in forecasted revenues the company performed a second interim impairment test of certain aircraft fleet types in 2009 due to an additional decrease in market prices as further discussed below 

similarly during 2008 the company performed an interim impairment test of its goodwill all intangible assets and certain of its longlived assets principally aircraft and related spare engines and spare parts as of may 31 2008 due to events and changes in circumstances during the first and second quarters of 2008 that indicated an impairment might have occurred factors deemed by management to have collectively constituted an impairment triggering event included record high fuel prices significant losses in the first and second quarters of 2008 a softening us economy analyst downgrade of ual common stock rating agency changes in outlook for the company’s debt instruments from stable to negative the planned removal from ual’s fleet of 100 aircraft and a significant decrease in the fair value of the company’s outstanding equity and debt securities including a decline in ual’s market capitalization to significantly below book value 

discussed below is the methodology used for each type of asset impairment shown in the table above 

aircraft and definitelived intangible asset impairments 

2009 impairment testing 

the company tested certain of its definitelived intangible assets at february 28 2009 and determined that the carrying value of its definitelived intangible assets was fully recoverable because their carrying amount 

  

exceeded the sum of the undiscounted cash flows attributable to their use as of february 28 2009 the company also tested its aircraft for impairment for all but two fleet types the company determined that the fleet types were not impaired as estimated cash flows exceeded carrying value for the two fleet types which had estimated undiscounted cash flows less than carrying value the company estimated the fair value of these fleet types and determined that the aircraft were not impaired as the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value for purposes of testing impairment of aircraft the estimated undiscounted cash flows were dependent on a number of critical management assumptions including estimates of future capacity passenger yield traffic operating costs including fuel prices and other relevant assumptions if estimates of fair value were required fair value was estimated using the market approach asset appraisals published aircraft pricing guides and recent transactions for similar aircraft were considered by the company in its market value determination 

in the fourth quarter of 2009 the company tested five of its owned regional jets which are leased to a third party for impairment due to a weak market for these aircraft and a remaining lease term of approximately one year as a result of this testing the company recorded impairment charges of 19 million to record the regional aircraft at estimated fair value as of december 31 2009 

on a quarterly basis in 2009 the company reviewed the carrying values of its nonoperating b737 and five b747 aircraft which are being marketed for sale to assess whether the carrying values were recoverable as a result of this testing the carrying value of the nonoperating b737s and five nonoperating b747 aircraft was reduced to a lower estimated fair value resulting in charges of 19 million and 55 million in the third and fourth quarters of 2009 respectively 

2008 impairment testing 

the company tested all aircraft for impairment as of may 31 2008 for the reasons discussed above based on the results of these tests the company determined that an impairment of 38 million existed which was attributable to the company’s fleet of owned b737 aircraft and related spare parts in addition as of december 31 2008 the company performed an impairment test of its b737 aircraft based on this analysis the company recorded an additional charge of 107 million to reduce the carrying value of the b737 aircraft as described in note 2 “company operational plans” in the footnotes the company retired its entire b737 fleet earlier than originally planned 

due to the unfavorable economic and industry factors described above the company also determined in the second quarter of 2008 that it was required to perform an impairment test of its 105 million of predelivery aircraft deposits and related capitalized interest the company determined that these aircraft deposits were completely impaired and wrote off their full carrying value the company believes that it is highly unlikely that it will take these future aircraft deliveries and therefore the company will be required to forfeit the deposits which are not transferable based on existing contract terms 

as a result of the 2008 impairment testing described above the company’s goodwill and certain of its indefinitelived intangible assets and tangible assets were recorded at fair value the company was not required to apply certain new fair value accounting principles to the determination of the fair value of these assets in 2008 as the new principles were not effective for nonfinancial assets and liabilities however the provisions of this standard were applied to the determination of the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities that were part of the step two goodwill fair value determination 

due to extreme fuel price volatility tight credit markets the uncertain economic environment as well as other uncertainties the company can provide no assurance that a material impairment charge will not occur in a future period the company will continue to monitor circumstances and events in future periods to determine whether additional asset impairment testing is warranted 

  

indefinitelived intangible assets 

2009 interim impairment test 

as of february 28 2009 the company performed an interim impairment test of all indefinitelived intangible assets due to events and changes in circumstances during the first quarter of 2009 that indicated an impairment might have occurred as discussed above 

indefinitelived intangible assets tested for impairment included tradenames international route authorities london heathrow slots and codesharing agreements the company utilized appropriate valuation techniques to separately estimate the fair values of all of its indefinitelived intangible assets as of february 28 2009 and compared those estimates to related carrying values the methods used to test these assets were primarily income methodologies which were based on estimated future cash flows except for the valuation of the london heathrow slots for which fair value was estimated using the market approach as of february 28 2009 the only impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets was related to the carrying value of united’s tradenames in the amount 40 million in addition the company performed a second interim impairment test of only tradenames as of may 31 2009 which resulted in an additional impairment of 110 million as a result of both of the impairment tests the company recorded impairment charges of 150 million to decrease the carrying value of the tradenames to estimated fair value as of may 31 2009 

2008 interim impairment test 

the company utilized appropriate valuation techniques to separately estimate the fair values of all of its indefinitelived intangible assets as of may 31 2008 and compared those estimates to related carrying values tested assets included tradenames international route authorities london heathrow slots and codesharing agreements the company used a market or income valuation approach as described above to estimate fair values based on the results of this testing the company recorded a 64 million impairment charge to indefinitelived intangible assets for the year ended december 31 2008 

annual impairment tests 

united performed annual impairment reviews of its indefinitelived intangible assets as of october 1 2009 and 2008 and determined that no impairment was indicated 

goodwill 

for purposes of testing goodwill in 2008 the company estimated the fair value of the mainline reporting unit to which all goodwill is allocated utilizing several fair value measurement techniques including two market estimates and one income estimate and using relevant data available through and as of may 31 2008 the market approach is a valuation technique in which fair value is estimated based on observed prices in actual transactions and on asking prices for similar assets the valuation process is essentially that of comparison and correlation between the subject asset and other similar assets the income approach is a technique in which fair value is estimated based on the cash flows that an asset could be expected to generate over its useful life including residual value cash flows these cash flows are discounted to their present value equivalents using a rate of return that accounts for the relative risk of not realizing the estimated annual cash flows and for the time value of money 

under the market approaches the fair value of the mainline reporting unit was estimated based upon the fair value of invested capital for ual as well as a separate comparison to revenue and ebitdar multiples for similar publicly traded companies in the airline industry the fair value estimates using both market approaches included a control premium similar to those observed for historical airline and transportation company market transactions 

  

under the income approach the fair value of the mainline reporting unit was estimated based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows for ual the income approach is dependent on a number of critical management assumptions including estimates of future capacity passenger yield traffic operating costs including fuel prices appropriate discount rates and other relevant assumptions the company estimated its future fuelrelated cash flows for the income approach based on the fiveyear forward curve for crude oil as of may 31 2008 the impacts of the company’s aircraft and other tangible and intangible asset impairments were considered in the fair value estimation of the mainline reporting unit 

taking into consideration an equal weighting of the two market estimates and the income estimate which has been the company’s practice when performing annual goodwill impairment tests the indicated fair value of the mainline reporting unit was less than its carrying value and therefore the company was required to perform additional goodwill impairment testing for this testing the company determined the implied fair value of goodwill of the mainline reporting unit by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of the mainline reporting unit including any recognized and unrecognized intangible assets as if the mainline reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the mainline reporting unit was the acquisition price as a result of this testing the company determined that goodwill was completely impaired and therefore recorded an impairment charge during the second quarter of 2008 to writeoff the full value of goodwill 

accounting for longlived assets the net book value of operating property and equipment for ual was 98 billion and 103 billion at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively in addition to the original cost of these assets as adjusted by freshstart reporting as of february 1 2006 their recorded value is impacted by a number of accounting policy elections including the estimation of useful lives and residual values and when necessary the recognition of asset impairment charges 

the company records assets acquired including aircraft at acquisition cost depreciable life is determined through economic analysis such as reviewing existing fleet plans obtaining appraisals and comparing estimated lives to other airlines that operate similar fleets older generation aircraft are assigned lives that are generally consistent with the experience of united and the practice of other airlines as aircraft technology has improved useful life has increased and the company has generally estimated the lives of those aircraft to be 30 years residual values are estimated based on historical experience with regard to the sale of both aircraft and spare parts and are established in conjunction with the estimated useful lives of the related fleets residual values are based on current dollars when the aircraft are acquired and typically reflect asset values that have not reached the end of their physical life both depreciable lives and residual values are revised periodically to recognize changes in the company’s fleet plan and other relevant information a one year increase in the average depreciable life of our flight equipment would reduce annual depreciation expense on flight equipment by approximately 17 million 

other postretirement benefit accounting the company accounts for other postretirement benefits by recognizing the difference between plan assets and obligations or the plan’s funded status in its financial statements under gaap other postretirement benefit expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees’ approximate service periods and is generally calculated independently of funding decisions or requirements the company has not been required to prefund its current and future plan obligations which has resulted in a significant net obligation as discussed below 

the fair value of plan assets at december 31 2009 and 2008 was 58 million and 57 million respectively for the other postretirement benefit plans the benefit obligation was 20 billion for the other postretirement benefit plans at both december 31 2009 and 2008 the difference between the plan assets and obligations has been recorded in the financial statements detailed information regarding the company’s other postretirement plans including key assumptions is included in note 8 “retirement and postretirement plans” in the footnotes 

the following provides a summary of the methodology used to determine the assumptions disclosed in note 8 “retirement and postretirement plans” in the footnotes the calculation of other postretirement benefit 

  

expense and obligations requires the use of a number of assumptions including the assumed discount rate for measuring future payment obligations and the expected return on plan assets the discount rates were based on the construction of theoretical corporate bond portfolios adjusted according to the timing of expected cash flows for the payment of the company’s future postretirement obligations a yield curve was developed based on a subset of these bonds those with yields between the 10 th and 90 th percentiles the projected cash flows were matched to this yield curve and a present value developed which was then calibrated to develop a single equivalent riskadjusted discount rate 

actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions under the applicable accounting standards those gains and losses are not required to be recognized currently as other postretirement expense but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into expense over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees the company’s accounting policy is to not apply the corridor approach available under applicable gaap with respect to amortization of amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income under the corridor approach amortization of any gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income is only required if at the beginning of the year the accumulated gain or loss exceeds 10 of the greater of the benefit obligation or the fair value of assets if amortization is required the minimum amount outside the corridor divided by the average remaining service period of active employees is recognized as expense the corridor approach is intended to reduce volatility of amounts recorded in pension expense each year since the company has elected not to apply the corridor approach all gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are amortized to expense over the remaining years of service at december 31 2009 and 2008 the company had unrecognized actuarial gains of 155 million and 286 million respectively recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income for its other postretirement benefit plans 

valuation allowance for deferred tax assets at december 31 2009 ual and united had valuation allowances applied to its deferred tax assets of approximately 31 billion and 30 billion respectively in accordance with accounting principles related to income taxes a valuation allowance is required to be recorded when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized future realization depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carry forward period available under the tax law sources of future taxable income include future reversals of taxable temporary differences future taxable income exclusive of reversing taxable differences taxable income in carry back years and tax planning strategies these sources of positive evidence of realizability must be weighed against negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years a recent history of losses would make difficult a determination that a valuation allowance is not needed 

in forming a judgment about the future realization of our deferred tax assets management considered both the positive and negative evidence of realizability and gave significant weight to the negative evidence from our cumulative losses for recent years management will continue to assess the valuation allowance and make appropriate adjustments based on the positive and negative evidence existing at that time the company is currently unable to forecast when there will be sufficient positive evidence for it to reverse the remainder of the valuation allowances that are recorded any reversals of valuation allowance would reduce income tax expense see note 7 “income taxes” in the footnotes for additional information

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks united’s exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to its debt obligations the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio united’s policy is to manage interest rate risk through a combination of fixed and variable rate debt and by entering into swap agreements depending upon market conditions a portion of united’s aircraft lease obligations and related accrued interest 295 million in equivalent us dollars at december 31 2009 is denominated in foreign currencies that expose the company to risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates to hedge against this risk united has placed foreign currency deposits 295 million in equivalent us dollars at december 31 2009 primarily for euros to meet foreign currency lease obligations denominated in that respective currency since unrealized marktomarket gains or losses on the foreign currency deposits are offset by the losses or gains on the foreign currency obligations united has hedged its overall exposure to foreign currency exchange rate volatility with respect to its foreign lease deposits and obligations the fair value of these deposits is determined based on the present value of future cash flows using an appropriate foreign currency swap rate the fair value of longterm debt is predominantly based on the present value of future cash flows using a us treasury rate that matches the remaining life of the instrument adjusted by a credit spread and to a lesser extent on the quoted market prices for the same or similar instruments the table below presents information as of december 31 2009 about certain of the company’s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest and exchange rates amounts shown below are the same for both ual and united except as noted 

  

  

 in addition to the cash equivalents included in the table above both ual and united have 128 million of shortterm restricted cash and 213 million and 212 million respectively of longterm restricted cash as discussed in note 1d “summary of significant accounting policies—cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash” in the footnotes restricted cash primarily includes cash collateral to secure workers’ compensation obligations reserves for institutions that process credit card ticket sales and in 2009 cash collateral received from fuel hedge counterparties due to the short term nature of these cash balances their carrying values approximate their fair values the company’s interest income is exposed to changes in interest rates on these cash balances during 2007 the company also repurchased certain of its own debt instruments which remain outstanding and have a fair value and carrying value of 51 million at december 31 2009 the company recognizes changes in fair value of these securities through other comprehensive income however on a net basis the company is not exposed to market risk due to the existence of offsetting changes in the fair value of the company’s related debt obligations 

the material changes in the amounts reported in the table above for 2009 as compared to 2008 include the following 1 cash and shortterm investments increased by approximately 10 billion primarily due to cash provided by operating and financing activities as discussed in liquidity above and 2 debt obligations increased by 242 million primarily due to new debt issuances in 2009 partially offset by scheduled debt repayments in 2009 the interest rate on the company’s cash and variable rate debt decreased in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to a decrease in market interest rates 

commodity price risk jet fuel our results of operations and liquidity have been and may continue to be materially impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel and other oilrelated commodities and related derivative instruments united may use swaps purchased call options or other derivative instruments to reduce its price risk exposure to jet fuel the company’s derivative positions are typically comprised of crude oil heating oil and jet fuel derivatives the derivative instruments are designed to provide protection against increases in the price of aircraft fuel some derivative instruments may result in hedging losses if the underlying commodity prices drop below specified floors or swap prices however the negative impact of these losses may 

  

be offset by the benefit of lower jet fuel acquisition cost since the company typically does not hedge all of its fuel consumption and only uses swaps or sold puts on a portion of the fuel volumes that it does hedge united may adjust its hedging program based on changes in market conditions at december 31 2009 the fair value of united’s fuelrelated derivatives was a payable of 5 million and a receivable of 138 million as compared to a payable of 727 million at december 31 2008 the primary reasons for this change were the dramatic decrease in fuel prices in the latter part of 2008 subsequent fuel price increases in 2009 and turnover of the company’s hedge portfolio to instruments with a lower average strike price at december 31 2009 the company also had 15 million of additional fuel derivative payables related to pending settlements for purchased call options and expired contracts 

as of december 31 2009 the company had hedged approximately 36 of its 2010 consolidated fuel consumption primarily with a combination of swaps and purchased call options the company’s hedge position at december 31 2009 consists of a notional amount of 97 million barrels with purchased call options at a weightedaverage crude oil equivalent strike price of 76 per barrel and 99 million barrels with swaps at an average price of 77 per barrel all of these derivative instruments mature within 12 months of december 31 2009 as of december 31 2008 the company had hedged 34 of its 2009 consolidated fuel consumption primarily with collar structures the company had significant losses on its 2008 hedge position as certain of the collar structures required payments by united to its counterparties for decreases in the price of crude oil below approximately 100 per barrel 

the above derivative positions are subject to potential counterparty cash collateral requirements in some circumstances the company provided counterparties with cash collateral of 10 million as of december 31 2009 

foreign currency united generates revenues and incurs expenses in numerous foreign currencies such expenses include fuel aircraft leases commissions catering personnel expense advertising and distribution costs customer service expenses and aircraft maintenance changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the company’s results of operations through changes in the dollar value of foreign currencydenominated operating revenues and expenses 

despite the adverse effects a strengthening foreign currency may have on demand for usoriginating traffic a strengthening of foreign currencies tends to increase reported revenue and operating income because the company’s foreign currencydenominated operating revenue generally exceeds its foreign currencydenominated operating expense for each currency likewise despite the favorable effects a weakening foreign currency may have on demand for usoriginating traffic a weakening of foreign currencies tends to decrease reported revenue and operating income 

the company’s most significant net foreign currency exposures in 2009 based on exchange rates in effect at december 31 2009 are presented in the table below 

 

 the company may use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31 2009 the company did not have any derivative positions to hedge foreign currency cash flows as of december 31 2008 the company hedged a portion of its expected foreign currency cash flows in the australian dollar canadian dollar and european euro as of december 31 2008 the notional amount of these foreign currencies hedged with the forward contracts in us dollars terms was approximately 62 million based on contractual forward rates these contracts had a fair value of 10 million at december 31 2008

company operational plans 

 

during 2008 ual’s management and its board of directors were active in adjusting the company’s operational plans in response to difficult industry conditions and the weakening global economy unprecedented increases in jet fuel prices during 2008 had a significant negative impact on our results of operations and were one of the leading factors that prompted the development of the company’s operational plans as described in note 2 “company operational plans” in combined notes to consolidated financial statements  

 

the company is taking actions to return to profitability and to strengthen liquidity including the permanent removal of 100 aircraft from united’s mainline fleet the elimination of the ted product for leisure markets and the reconfiguration of ted aircraft to include united first seating the development of new revenue sources through delivery of new products and services valued by our customers the streamlining of operations and corporate functions with a reduction of approximately 9000 positions during 2008 and 2009 and the formation of a strategic alliance with continental airlines all as further discussed in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

 

during 2008 the company ceased operations to ft lauderdale and west palm beach florida two markets served by ted which uses an alleconomy seating configuration to serve primarily leisure markets in addition during 2008 as part of its operational plans the company ceased operations in certain nonted markets and also reduced frequencies in several ted and nonted markets in light of these planned capacity reductions and other factors the company also determined that it would eliminate its entire b737 fleet by the end of 2009 with the reduced need for ted aircraft in leisure markets and an increased need for narrow body aircraft in nonted markets due to the elimination of the b737 fleet the company decided to reconfigure the entire ted fleet of alleconomy airbus aircraft to include first class as well as economy plus and economy seats the reconfigured airbus aircraft will provide united a consistent product offering for our customers and employees and increases our fleet flexibility to redeploy aircraft onto former ted and other narrow body routes as market conditions change 

 

overall the company has characterized its business approach as “focus on five” a comprehensive set of priorities that focus on the fundamentals of running a good airline one that runs on time with clean planes and courteous employees that delivers industryleading revenues and competitive costs and does so safely building on this foundation united aims to regain its industryleading position in key metrics reported by the us department of transportation “dot” as well as industryleading revenue driven by products services schedules and routes that are valued by the company’s customers the goal 

of this approach is intended to enable united to achieve bestinclass safety performance exceptional customer satisfaction and experience and industryleading margin and cash flow 

 

bankruptcy of predecessor company 

 

on december 9 2002 the “petition date” ual united and 26 direct and indirect whollyowned subsidiaries collectively the “debtors” filed voluntary petitions to reorganize their businesses under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of illinois eastern division the “bankruptcy court” on january 20 2006 the bankruptcy court confirmed the debtors’ second amended joint plan of reorganization pursuant to chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code the “plan of reorganization” the plan of reorganization became effective and the debtors emerged from bankruptcy protection on february 1 2006 the “effective date” on the effective date the company implemented freshstart reporting in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants’ statement of position 907 financial reporting by entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code “sop 907” resulting in significant changes as compared to the historical financial statements 

 

during the course of its chapter 11 proceedings the company successfully reached settlements with most of its creditors and resolved most pending claims against the debtors however certain significant matters remain to be resolved in the bankruptcy court for further details see note 4 “voluntary reorganization under chapter 11—significant matters remaining to be resolved in chapter 11 cases” in combined notes to consolidated financial statements  

 

operations 

 

segments the company operates its businesses through two reporting segments mainline and united express the company manages its business as an integrated network with assets deployed across integrated mainline and regional carrier networks this focus on managing the business seeks to maximize the profitability of the overall airline network financial information on the company’s reporting segments and operating revenues by geographic regions as reported to the dot can be found in note 10 “segment information” in combined notes to consolidated financial statements  

 

mainline the company’s mainline operating revenues were 171 billion 170 billion and 164 billion in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively as of december 31 2008 mainline domestic operations served over 80 destinations primarily throughout the us and canada and operated hubs at chicago o’hare international airport “o’hare” denver international airport “denver” los angeles international airport “lax” san francisco international airport “sfo” and washington dulles international airport “washington dulles” mainline international operations serve the pacific atlantic and latin america regions the pacific region includes nonstop service to beijing hong kong osaka seoul shanghai sydney and tokyo and direct service to bangkok seoul singapore and taipei via tokyo direct service to ho chi minh city and singapore via hong kong and to melbourne via sydney the atlantic region includes nonstop service to amsterdam brussels dubai frankfurt kuwait city london munich paris rome and zurich the latin american region offers nonstop service to buenos aires rio de janeiro seasonal nonstop and sao paulo the latin american region also serves various mexico destinations including cancun cozumel seasonal ixtapazihuatanejo seasonal mexico city puerto vallarta and san jose del cabo various caribbean points including aruba and seasonal service to montego bay punta cana and st maarten and central america including liberia costa rica seasonal 

 

ual’s operating revenues attributed to mainline domestic operations were 97 billion in 2008 109 billion in 2007 and 100 billion in 2006 operating revenues attributed to mainline international operations were 74 billion in 2008 61 billion in 2007 and 64 billion in 2006 for purposes of the company’s geographic revenue reporting the company considers destinations in mexico and the caribbean to be part of the latin america region as opposed to the north america region 

the mainline segment operated 409 aircraft as of december 31 2008 and produced 1358 billion available seat miles “asms” and 1101 billion revenue passenger miles “rpms” during 2008 in 2007 the mainline segment produced 1419 billion asms and 1174 billion rpms 

 

united express united express operating revenues were 31 billion in both 2008 and 2007 and 29 billion in 2006 united has contractual relationships with various regional carriers to provide regional jet and turboprop service branded as united express united express is an extension of the united mainline network chautauqua airlines colgan airlines go jet airlines mesa airlines shuttle america skywest airlines and trans states airlines are all united express carriers most of which operate under capacity purchase agreements under these agreements united pays the regional carriers contractuallyagreed fees carriercontrolled costs for operating these flights plus a variable reimbursement incentive payment based on agreed performance metrics the carriercontrolled costs are based on specific rates for various operating expenses of the united express carriers such as crew expenses maintenance and aircraft ownership some of which are multiplied by specific operating statistics eg block hours departures while others are fixed monthly amounts the incentive payment is a markup applied to the carriercontrolled costs for superior operational performance under these capacity agreements united is responsible for all fuel costs incurred as well as landing fees facilities rent and deicing costs which are passed through without any markup in return the regional carriers operate this capacity on schedules determined by united united also determines pricing revenues and inventory levels and assumes the inventory and distribution risk for the available seats 

 

the capacity agreements which united has entered into with united express carriers do not include the provision of ground handling services as a result united express sources ground handling support from a variety of thirdparty providers as well as by utilizing internal united resources in some cases 

 

while the regional carriers operating under capacity purchase agreements comprise over 95 of united express flying the company also has limited prorate agreements with colgan airlines and skywest airlines under these prorate agreements united and its prorate partners agree to divide revenue collected from each passenger according to a formula while both united and the prorate partners are individually responsible for their own costs of operations united also collects a program fee from colgan airlines to cover certain marketing and distribution costs such as credit card transaction fees global distribution systems “gds” transaction fees and frequent flyer costs unlike capacity purchase agreements these prorate agreements require the regional carrier to retain the control and risk of scheduling market selection seat pricing and inventory for its flights 

 

united express carriers operated 280 aircraft as of december 31 2008 and produced 162 billion asms and 121 billion rpms during 2008 while producing 163 billion asms and 126 billion rpms in 2007 

 

united cargo united cargo offers both domestic and international shipping through a variety of services including united small package delivery express and general cargo services freight shipments comprise approximately 85 of united cargo’s volumes with mail comprising the remainder during 2008 united cargo accounted for approximately 4 of the company’s operating revenues by generating 854 million in freight and mail revenue an 11 increase versus 2007 

 

united services united services is a global airline support business offering customers comprehensive aircraft maintenance repair and overhaul “mro” services which include engine and line maintenance services united services brings nearly 80 years of experience to serve over 100 airline customer contracts worldwide during 2008 and 2007 united services generated approximately 167 million and 183 million respectively in thirdparty revenue 

 

fuel the price and availability of jet fuel significantly affects the company’s results of operations fuel has been the company’s largest operating expense for the last several years the company has a risk management strategy to hedge a portion of its price risk related to projected jet fuel requirements the company utilizes various types of hedging instruments including purchased calls collars 3way collars and 4way collars a collar involves the purchase of fuel call options with the simultaneous sale of 

fuel put options with identical expiration dates if fuel prices rise above the ceiling of the collar the company’s counterparties are required to make settlement payments to the company while if fuel prices fall below the floor of the collars the company is required to make settlement payments to its fuel hedge counterparties in addition the company has been and may in the future be further required to provide counterparties with cash collateral prior to settlement of the hedge positions 

 

in both 2008 and 2007 an increase in jet fuel prices was the primary reason for higher mainline and united express fuel expense and aircraft fuel cost per gallon as highlighted in the table below the price of crude oil reached a record high of approximately 145 per barrel in july 2008 and then dramatically decreased in the second half of the year to approximately 45 per barrel at december 31 2008 this significant fuel price volatility drove the company’s total fuel hedge losses of more than 11 billion in 2008 a significant portion of these losses were unrealized as of december 31 2008 and could increase or decrease in future periods based on future changes in market prices before the related hedge contracts settle while the company’s results of operations should benefit significantly from lower fuel prices on its unhedged fuel consumption in the near term lower fuel prices could also significantly and negatively impact liquidity based on the amount of cash settlements and collateral that may be required 

 

the company accounts for the majority of its fuel derivative contracts as economic hedges which are markedtomarket with gains and losses classified as fuel expense remaining fuel derivative contracts which do not qualify for economic hedge accounting are markedtomarket with gains and losses classified as nonoperating expense see item 7a “quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk” and note 13 “fair value measurements and derivative instruments” in combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding gains and losses from settled and open positions cash settlements unrealized amounts at the end of the period and hedge collateral derivative gains and losses from contracts qualifying for economic hedge accounting are recorded in mainline fuel expense and are not allocated to united express fuel expense 

 

 

 

  

to ensure adequate supplies of fuel and to provide a measure of control over fuel costs the company arranges to have fuel shipped on major pipelines and stored close to its major hub locations although the company currently does not anticipate a significant reduction in the availability of jet fuel a number of factors make predicting fuel prices and fuel availability uncertain including changes in world energy demand geopolitical uncertainties affecting energy supplies from oilproducing nations industrial accidents threats of terrorism directed at oil supply infrastructure extreme weather conditions causing temporary shutdowns of production and refining capacity as well as changes in relative demand for other petroleum products that may impact the quantity and price of jet fuel produced from period to period 

alliances united has a number of bilateral and multilateral alliances with other airlines which enhance travel options for customers seeking access to markets that united does not serve directly these marketing alliances typically include one or more of the following features joint frequent flyer program participation codesharing of flight operations whereby seats on one carrier’s selected flights can be marketed under the brand name of another carrier coordination of reservations ticketing passenger checkin baggage handling and flight schedules and other resourcesharing activities 

 

the most significant of these arrangements is the star alliance a global integrated airline network cofounded by united in 1997 as of february 1 2009 star alliance carriers serve approximately 900 destinations in 159 countries with over 16500 average daily flights current star alliance partners in addition to united are air canada air china air new zealand all nippon airways asiana the austrian airlines group bmi egyptair lot polish airlines lufthansa sas shanghai airlines singapore airlines south african airways spanair swiss tap portugal thai turkish airlines and us airways regional member carriers are adria airways slovenia blue1 finland and croatia airlines air india brussels airlines continental airlines and tam airlines are expected to become future members of the star alliance 

 

united also has independent marketing agreements with other air carriers including aer lingus air one great lakes aviation gulfstream international hawaiian island air qatar airways taca group and virgin blue 

 

continental alliance in 2008 united and continental announced their plan to form a new alliance partnership that will link the airlines’ networks and services worldwide to the benefit of customers employees and shareholders creating new revenue opportunities cost savings and other efficiencies in addition continental plans to join united and its 20 other partners in the star alliance the most comprehensive airline alliance in the world during 2008 united continental and eight other airlines submitted a request to the dot and applicable foreign authorities to allow continental to join united air canada lufthansa and six other carriers in their already established antitrust immunized alliance if approved the immunity will enable united air canada continental and lufthansa to implement a joint venture covering transatlantic routings that would deliver highly competitive flight schedules fares and service in the us market where antitrust immunity would not apply customers will benefit as united and continental plan to begin broad codesharing which eases travel for customers flying on itineraries using both carriers and cooperation on frequent flyer programs and airport lounges subject to regulatory notice and continental exiting certain of its current alliance relationships in addition united and continental are also exploring opportunities to capture important cost savings in the areas of information technology frequent flyer programs airport operations lounges procurement and sales and marketing 

 

continental’s and united’s route networks are highly complementary with little overlap so they add value to each other and to customers who are planning domestic and international travel under codesharing customers will benefit from a coordinated process for reservationsticketing checkin flight connections and baggage transfer frequent flyer reciprocity will allow members of continental’s onepass program and united’s mileage plus program to earn miles in their accounts when flying on either partner airline and redeem awards on both carriers continental’s plans to join the star alliance and other planned cooperation are subject to certain regulatory and other approvals and the termination of certain contractual relationships including continental’s existing agreements with skyteam members that restrict its participation in another global alliance 

 

mileage plus mileage plus builds customer loyalty by offering awards and services to frequent travelers mileage plus members can earn mileage credit for flights on united united express ted members of the star alliance and certain other airlines that participate in the program miles can also be earned by purchasing the goods and services of our nonairline partners such as hotels car rental companies and credit card issuers mileage credits can be redeemed for free discounted or upgraded travel and nontravel awards there are more than 54 million members enrolled in mileage plus in 2008 23 million mileage plus travel awards were used on united as compared to 22 million in 2007 

and 23 million in 2006 these amounts represent the number of awards for which travel was provided and not the number of available seats that were allocated to award travel these awards represented 91 of united’s total revenue passenger miles in 2008 80 in 2007 and 81 in 2006 in addition mileage plus members redeemed miles for approximately 613000 nonunited awards in 2008 as compared to 928000 in 2007 nonunited awards include awards such as red carpet club memberships car and hotel awards merchandise and travel solely on another air carrier total miles redeemed for travel on united in 2008 including travel awards and classofservice upgrades represented 89 of the total miles redeemed for both completed and future travel the company expanded its offering of merchandise available for awards in 2009 which may increase the amount of nontravel awards 

 

for a detailed description of the accounting treatment of mileage plus program activity which was changed to a deferred revenue model upon the adoption of freshstart reporting on the effective date see critical accounting policies in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

 

ual loyalty services llc “uls” uls focuses on expanding the noncore marketing businesses of united and building airline customer loyalty uls operates substantially all unitedbranded travel distribution and customer loyalty ecommerce activities such as unitedcom in addition uls owns and operates mileage plus being responsible for member relationships communications and account management while united is responsible for other aspects of mileage plus including elite membership programs such as global services premier premier executive and premier executive 1k and the establishment of award mileage redemption programs and airlinerelated customer loyalty recognition policies united is also responsible for managing relationships with its mileage plus airline partners while uls manages relationships with nonairline business partners such as the mileage plus visa card hotels car rental companies and dining programs among others 

 

distribution channels the majority of united’s airline seat inventory continues to be distributed through the traditional channels of travel agencies and gds such as sabre and galileo the growing use of alternative distribution systems including wwwunitedcom and gds new entrants provides united with an opportunity to lower its ticket distribution costs to encourage customer use of lowercost channels and capitalize on these costsaving opportunities the company will continue to expand the capabilities of its website 

 

industry conditions 

 

seasonality the air travel business is subject to seasonal fluctuations the company’s operations can be adversely impacted by severe weather and the first and fourth quarter results of operations normally reflect lower travel demand historically results of operations are better in the second and third quarters which reflect higher levels of travel demand 

 

domestic competition the domestic airline industry is highly competitive and dynamic in domestic markets new and existing carriers are generally free to initiate service between any two points within the united states united’s competitors consist primarily of other airlines a number of whom are lowcost carriers “lccs” with cost structures lower than united’s and to a lesser extent other forms of transportation 

 

the rate of capacity increases in the domestic market has slowed in the past several years but lccs have continued expanding into markets where united flies united has extensive experience competing directly with lccs in its markets and believes it is well positioned to compete effectively in response to the adverse economic conditions in 2008 united and many of its competitors implemented significant capacity reductions in both domestic and international markets 

united’s capacity increases decreases for 2008 and its forecasted 2009 capacity decreases as compared to the yearago periods are summarized in the following table 

 

 

 

during 2008 several smaller carriers entered into either bankruptcy liquidation or reorganization proceedings carriers that reorganize through bankruptcy proceedings may be able to improve their cost structure making them more competitive with the rest of the industry in addition delta airlines completed its acquisition of northwest airlines corporation in late 2008 this merger may enable the combined airline to improve its revenue and cost performance relative to peers and thus enhance its competitive position within the industry it is also possible that other airline mergers or acquisitions may occur in the future 

 

domestic pricing decisions are largely affected by the need to be competitive with other us airlines fare discounting by competitors has historically had a negative effect on the company’s financial results because united often finds it necessary to match competitors’ fares to maintain passenger traffic attempts by united and other network airlines to raise fares often fail due to lack of competitive matching by lccs however because of capacity constraint the pressure of higher fuel prices and other industry conditions some fare increases have occurred in recent years because of different cost structures low ticket prices that may generate a profit for a lcc may have an adverse effect on the company’s financial results also additional revenue from fuelrelated fare increases may not completely offset the company’s increased cost of fuel 

 

international competition in united’s international networks the company competes not only with us airlines but also with foreign carriers competition on specified international routes is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulations recently the us and european union “eu” implemented an agreement to reduce restrictions on flight operations between the two entities this agreement has increased competition on united’s transatlantic network from both us and european airlines in our pacific operations competition will be increasing as the governments of the us and china permit more us and chinese airlines to fly new routes between the two countries although the commencement of some new services to china has been recently postponed due to the weak global economy see industry regulation  below part of united’s ability to successfully compete with nonus carriers on international routes is its ability to generate traffic from and to the entire us via its integrated domestic route network foreign carriers are currently prohibited by us law from carrying local passengers between two points in the us and united experiences comparable restrictions in many foreign countries in addition us carriers are often constrained from carrying passengers to points beyond designated international gateway cities due to limitations in air service agreements or restrictions imposed unilaterally by foreign governments to compensate for these structural limitations us and foreign carriers have entered into alliances and marketing arrangements that allow these carriers to exchange traffic between each other’s flights and route networks see alliances above for further details 

 

economic conditions airlines are highly susceptible to negative financial impacts caused by major changes in the global economy that drive sudden severe swings in costs or revenues during 2008 the combined forces of high fuel prices extensive competition and a severe global recession drove numerous us and international carriers to file for bankruptcy and in some cases to liquidate while fuel costs have significantly fallen since reaching historic highs in the summer of 2008 overall demand for airline services has decreased and may decrease further and the depth of and recovery from the global recession continues to be uncertain as discussed further in item 1a risk factors  and in item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the current 

economic conditions have had and may continue to have negative impacts on passenger demand revenues the level of credit card sales activity and our cargo operations in response to these economic conditions united and other carriers in the industry implemented significant reductions in domestic and international capacity which are expected to continue into 2009 

 

insurance united carries hull and liability insurance of a type customary in the air transportation industry in amounts that the company deems appropriate covering passenger liability public liability and damage to united’s aircraft and other physical property united also maintains other types of insurance such as property directors and officers cargo workers’ compensation automobile and the like with limits and deductibles that are standard within the industry after the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks the company’s insurance premiums increased significantly but have since been reduced reflecting the market’s perception of risk as well as the company’s ongoing capacity reductions additionally after september 11 2001 commercial insurers canceled united’s liability insurance for losses resulting from war and associated perils terrorism sabotage hijacking and other similar events the us government subsequently agreed to provide commercial warrisk insurance for us based airlines and has renewed this coverage on a periodic basis the current warrisk policy is effective until march 31 2009 and covers losses to employees passengers third parties and aircraft the secretary of transportation may extend this coverage until may 31 2009 if the us government does not extend this coverage beyond march 31 2009 obtaining comparable coverage from commercial underwriters could result in substantially higher premiums and more restrictive terms if it is available at all see “increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage may adversely impact the company’s operations and financial results” in item 1a risk factors  below 

 

industry regulation 

 

domestic regulation 

 

general all carriers engaged in air transportation in the us are subject to regulation by the dot among its responsibilities the dot issues certificates of public convenience and necessity for domestic air transportation no air carrier unless exempted may provide air transportation without a dot certificate of public convenience and necessity grants international route authorities approves international code share agreements regulates methods of competition and enforces certain consumer protection regulations such as those dealing with advertising denied boarding compensation and baggage liability 

 

airlines also are regulated by the federal aviation administration “faa” a division of the dot primarily in the areas of flight operations maintenance and other safety and technical matters the faa has authority to issue air carrier operating certificates and aircraft airworthiness certificates prescribe maintenance procedures and regulate pilot and other employee training among other responsibilities from time to time the faa issues rules that require air carriers to take certain actions such as the inspection or modification of aircraft and other equipment that may cause the company to incur substantial unplanned expenses the airline industry is also subject to various other federal laws and regulations the us department of homeland security “dhs” has jurisdiction over virtually all aspects of civil aviation security see legislation  below the us department of justice “doj” has jurisdiction over certain airline competition matters the us postal service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail labor relations in the airline industry are generally governed by the railway labor act “rla” the company is also subject to inquiries by the dot faa and other us and international regulatory bodies 

 

airport access access to landing and takeoff rights or “slots” at several major us airports and many foreign airports served by united are or recently have been subject to government regulation 

 

domestic slot restrictions currently apply at washington reagan national airport in washington dc john f kennedy airport and la guardia airport both in new york and newark airport in new jersey slot restrictions at o’hare ceased to apply as of november 2008 in 2008 the faa issued new rules related to slots at the three new york cityarea airports named above these rules provide for 

government confiscation of a portion of slots at each airport from incumbent airlines and establish a process whereby those slots will be auctioned over the course of five years the confiscation and auction provisions are controversial and are currently the subject of litigation in federal appellate court in which carriers serving those airports and the port authority of new york and new jersey claim that the faa lacks legal authority to conduct slot auctions on december 8 2008 the federal appellate court in washington dc stayed the auction pending a decision on the challenges to the auction process it is difficult to predict the outcome of that litigation if the slot auction provisions remain in effect united will likely lose a small number of slots at each of the three new york cityarea airports however the exact number is not yet known it is not yet clear what impact this might have on united’s operations at those airports 

 

also in 2008 the dot finalized amendments to its rates and charges policy that grant new authority to us airports to implement forms of congestion pricing the air transport association has filed a legal challenge to the amended policy we are currently unaware of any action by an airport to change pricing based on the new authority it is difficult to predict whether any given airport might seek to implement this new authority and what impact on revenues or costs a change in airport charges arising from this policy might have on united 

 

at the end of 2008 the dot proposed new regulations intended to enhance air passenger protection if made final as proposed the new regulations would create new areas of regulation and potentially permit passengers to sue air carriers should the carriers fail to meet certain service performance criteria 

 

legislation the airline industry is also subject to legislative activity that can have an impact on operations and costs specifically the law that authorizes federal excise taxes and fees assessed on airline tickets expired in september 2007 was extended to february 28 2008 and extended again until march 31 2009 congress is currently attempting to pass comprehensive reauthorization legislation to impose a new funding structure and make other changes to faa operations past aviation reauthorization bills have affected a wide range of areas of interest to the industry including air traffic control operations capacity control issues airline competition issues aircraft and airport technology requirements safety issues taxes fees and other funding sources there also exists the possibility that congress may pass other legislation that could increase labor and operating costs legislation is expected to focus on outsourced maintenance family and medical leave act changes and other work rules climate change legislation which would regulate greenhouse gas emissions is also likely to be a significant area of legislative and regulatory focus and could adversely impact fuel costs customer service issues have remained active areas for both congress and dot regulators during 2008 in addition to dotproposed customer service regulations discussed above legislation imposing more specific customer service requirements is likely to be approved by congress in 2009 though what those requirements might be is unclear at this time the dot has also proceeded with regulatory changes in this area including proposals regarding treatment of and payments to passengers involuntarily denied boarding domestic baggage liability proposals regarding flight delay reporting requirements and airline scheduling practices additionally since september 11 2001 aviation security has been and continues to be a subject of frequent legislative and regulatory action requiring changes to the company’s security processes and frequently increasing the cost of its security procedures 

 

international regulation 

 

general international air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation in connection with united’s international services the company is regulated by both the us government and the governments of the foreign countries united serves in addition the availability of international routes to us carriers is regulated by aviation agreements between the us and foreign governments and in some cases fares and schedules require the approval of the dot andor the relevant foreign governments 

airport access historically access to foreign markets has been tightly controlled through bilateral agreements between the us and each foreign country involved these agreements regulate the markets served the number of carriers allowed to serve each market and the frequency of carriers’ flights since the early 1990s the us has pursued a policy of “open skies” meaning all carriers have access to the destination under which the us government has negotiated a number of bilateral agreements allowing unrestricted access between us and foreign markets additionally all of the airports that united serves in europe and asia maintain slot controls and many of these are restrictive due to congestion at these airports london heathrow frankfurt and tokyo narita are among the most restrictive due to capacity limitations united has significant operations at these locations 

 

united’s ability to serve some foreign markets and expand into certain others is limited by the absence altogether of aviation agreements between the us government and the relevant governments shifts in us or foreign government aviation policies can lead to the alteration or termination of air service agreements depending on the nature of any such change the value of united’s international route authorities and slot rights may be materially enhanced or diminished 

 

the useu open skies agreement became effective in march 2008 this agreement replaced the bilateral arrangements between the us government and the 27 eu member states based on the us open skies model it provides us and eu carriers with expansive rights that have increased competition in transatlantic markets for example us and eu carriers now have the right to operate between any point in the us and the eu the agreement has no direct impact on airport slot rights nor does it provide for a reallocation of existing slots including those at london heathrow london heathrow currently remains subject to both slot and facility constraints 

 

the agreement provides united with additional commercial opportunities since it triggered the effectiveness of united’s antitrust immunity with british carrier bmi creating the potential for increased cooperation between the two carriers in the transatlantic market the dot had previously conditioned the carriers’ immunity upon the entry into force of an open skies agreement with the uk and the useu agreement satisfies this condition because of the diverse nature of potential impacts on united’s business however the overall future impact of the useu agreement on united’s business cannot be predicted with certainty 

 

also in 2008 the eu adopted interpretive guidance and legislation that will impact the company the commission has officially sanctioned secondary slot trading a current practice among carriers that involves the sale purchase or lease of slots this action resolves disputes about the legality of slot exchanges at eu airports including heathrow in addition the eu has adopted legislation to include aviation within the eu’s existing greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme effective in 2012 there are significant questions that remain as to the legality of applying the scheme to noneu airlines and the us and other governments are considering filing a legal challenge to the eu’s unilateral inclusion of noneu carriers while such a measure could significantly increase the costs of carriers operating in the eu the precise cost to united is difficult to calculate with certainty due to a number of variables and it is not clear whether the scheme will withstand legal challenge 

 

environmental regulation 

 

the airline industry is subject to increasingly stringent federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning emissions to the air discharges to surface and subsurface waters safe drinking water and the management of hazardous substances oils and waste materials new regulations surrounding the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide are being considered for promulgation both internationally and within the united states united is carefully evaluating the potential impact of such proposed regulations other areas of developing regulations include the state of california rulemakings regarding air emissions from ground support equipment and a federal rulemaking concerning the discharge of deicing fluid the airline industry is also subject to other environmental laws and regulations including those that require the company to remediate soil or groundwater to meet certain objectives compliance with all environmental laws and regulations can 

require significant expenditures under the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as “superfund” and similar environmental cleanup laws generators of waste materials and owners or operators of facilities can be subject to liability for investigation and remediation costs at locations that have been identified as requiring response actions the company also conducts voluntary environmental assessment and remediation actions environmental cleanup obligations can arise from among other circumstances the operation of aircraft fueling facilities and primarily involve airport sites future costs associated with these activities are currently not expected to have a material adverse affect on the company’s business 

 

employees 

 

as of december 31 2008 the company and its subsidiaries had approximately 50000 active employees of whom approximately 83 were represented by various us labor organizations the employee groups number of employees and labor organization for each of united’s collective bargaining groups were as follows 

 

 

 

  

collective bargaining agreements are negotiated under the rla which governs labor relations in the air transportation industry and such agreements typically do not contain an expiration date instead they specify an amendable date upon which the contract is considered “open for amendment” contracts remain in effect while new agreements are negotiated during the negotiation period both the company and the negotiating union are required to maintain the status quo the company plans to begin negotiations with its labor groups in 2009

 item 1a risk factors tableend  

the following risk factors should be read carefully when evaluating the company’s business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this report and other statements the company or its representatives make from time to time any of the following risks could materially adversely affect the company’s business operating results financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this report 

 

risks related to the company’s business 

 

the company may be unable to continue to comply with certain covenants in its amended credit facility and other agreements which if not complied with could accelerate repayment of the amended credit facility and similarly impact the company’s obligations under certain other agreements thereby materially and adversely affecting the company’s liquidity 

 

in february 2007 the company entered into an amended and restated revolving credit term loan and guaranty agreement dated as of february 2 2007 with jpmorgan chase bank na citicorp usa inc jp morgan securities inc citigroup global markets inc and credit suisse securities usa llc the “amended credit facility” after prepaying 972 million of its then outstanding credit facility debt the amended credit facility requires compliance with certain covenants which were further amended in may 2008 a summary of the current financial covenants includes the following 

 

the company must maintain a ratio of ebitdar to the sum of the following fixed charges for such period a cash interest expense and b cash aircraft operating rental expense ebitdar represents earnings before interest expense net of interest income income taxes depreciation amortization aircraft rent and certain cash and noncash charges as further defined by the amended credit facility the other adjustments to ebitdar include items such as foreign currency transaction gains or losses increases or decreases in our deferred revenue obligation sharebased compensation expense nonrecurring or unusual losses any noncash nonrecurring charge or noncash restructuring charge a limited amount of cash restructuring charges certain cash transaction costs incurred with financing activities and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle the requirement to meet this ratio was suspended for the four quarters beginning with the second quarter of 2008 and ending with the first quarter of 2009 but such requirement resumes beginning in the second quarter of 2009 the required ratio for the periods ended june 30 2009 september 30 2009 and december 31 2009 shall be computed based on three months ended june 30 2009 the six months ended september 30 2009 and the nine months ended december 31 2009 respectively and the required ratio in subsequent quarters shall be computed based on the twelve months preceding each quarterend the company must also maintain a minimum unrestricted cash balance of 10 billion at any time 

 

failure to comply with any applicable covenants in effect for any reporting period could result in a default under the amended credit facility additionally the amended credit facility contains a crossdefault provision with respect to other credit arrangements that exceed 50 million although the company was in compliance with all required financial covenants as of december 31 2008 and the company is not required to comply with a fixed charge coverage ratio until the three month period ending june 30 2009 continued compliance depends on many factors some of which are beyond the company’s control including the overall industry revenue environment and the level of fuel costs there are no assurances that the company will continue to comply with its amended credit facility covenants failure to comply with applicable covenants in any reporting period would result in a default under the amended credit facility which could have a material adverse impact on the company depending on the company’s ability to obtain a waiver of or otherwise mitigate the impact of the default 

the company may be unable to continue to comply with certain covenants in agreements with financial institutions that process customer credit card transactions which if not complied with could materially and adversely affect the company’s liquidity 

 

the company has agreements with financial institutions that process customer credit card transactions for the sale of air travel and other services under certain of the company’s card processing agreements the financial institutions either require or have the right to require that united maintain a reserve equal to a portion of advance ticket sales that have been processed by that financial institution but for which the company has not yet provided the air transportation referred to as “relevant advance ticket sales” as of december 31 2008 the company had advance ticket sales of approximately 15 billion of which approximately 13 billion relates to credit card sales 

 

in november 2008 united entered into an amendment for its card processing agreement with paymentech and jpmorgan chase bank the “amendment” that suspends until january 20 2010 the requirement for united to maintain additional cash reserves with this processor of bank cards above the current cash reserve of 25 million at december 31 2008 if united’s monthend balance of unrestricted cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments falls below 25 billion in exchange for this benefit united has granted the processor a security interest in certain of united’s owned aircraft with a current appraised value of at least 800 million united also has agreed that such security interest collateralizes not only united’s obligations under the processing agreement but also united’s obligations under united’s amended and restated cobranded card marketing services agreement united has an option to terminate the amendment prior to january 20 2010 in which event the parties’ prior credit card processing reserve arrangements under the processing agreement will go back into effect 

 

after january 20 2010 or in the event united terminates the amendment and in addition to certain other risk protections provided to the processor the amount of any such reserve will be determined based on the amount of unrestricted cash held by the company as defined under the amended credit facility if the company’s unrestricted cash balance is more than 25 billion as of any calendar monthend measurement date its required reserve will remain at 25 million however if the company’s unrestricted cash is less than 25 billion its required reserve will increase to a percentage of relevant advance ticket sales as summarized in the following table 

 

 

 

 

  

if the november 2008 amendment had not been in effect as of december 31 2008 the company would have been required to post an additional 132 million of reserves based on an actual unrestricted cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments balance of between 20 billion and 25 billion at december 31 2008 

 

united’s card processing agreement with american express expired on february 28 2009 and was replaced by a new agreement on march 1 2009 which has an initial five year term as of december 31 2008 there were no required reserves under this card agreement and no reserves were required up through the date of expiration 

 

under the new agreement in addition to certain other risk protections provided to american express the company will be required to provide reserves based primarily on its unrestricted cash 

balance and net current exposure as of any calendar monthend measurement date as summarized in the following table 

 

 

 

 

  

the new agreement permits the company to provide certain replacement collateral in lieu of cash collateral as long as the company’s unrestricted cash is above 135 billion such replacement collateral may be pledged for any amount of the required reserve up to the full amount thereof with the stated value of such collateral determined according to the agreement replacement collateral may be comprised of aircraft slots and routes real estate or other collateral as agreed between the parties 

 

in the near term the company will not be required to post reserves under the new american express agreement as long as unrestricted cash as measured at each monthend and as defined in the agreement is equal to or above 20 billion 

 

if the terms of the new agreement had been in place at december 31 2008 and ignoring the near term protection in the preceding sentence the company would have been required to provide collateral of approximately 40 million 

 

an increase in the future reserve requirements as provided by the terms of either or both the company’s material card processing agreements could materially reduce the company’s liquidity 

 

the company may not be able to maintain adequate liquidity 

 

while the company’s cash flows from operations and its available capital have been sufficient to meet its current operating expenses lease obligations and debt service requirements to date the company’s future liquidity could be negatively impacted by many factors including but not limited to substantial volatility in the price of fuel declines in passenger and cargo demand associated with the weak global economy and deterioration of global financial systems during 2008 particularly in the fourth quarter the company experienced weaker demand for its services due to the current economic conditions decreases in passenger and cargo demand resulting from a weak global economy have resulted in both lower passenger volumes and lower ticket fares which have adversely impacted our liquidity and are expected to adversely impact our results of operations and liquidity in 2009 in addition the company’s 2008 and planned 2009 capacity cuts may not be sufficient to address lower demand from a weak global economy see “economic and industry conditions constantly change and continued or worsening negative economic conditions in the united states and elsewhere may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations” below for further discussion of the adverse impacts of a weak economy on our operations 

 

in 2008 fuel price changes had a more significant impact on liquidity than changes in demand for the company’s products and services for example the crude oil spot price rose to a record high of approximately 145 per barrel in july 2008 the company’s consolidated fuel cost including the impact of fuel hedges increased by more than 31 billion for the full year of 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to increased fuel prices resulting in a significant negative impact on liquidity furthermore fuel prices continue to be extremely volatile which may negatively impact the company’s liquidity additionally the company’s fuel hedges require that it post cash collateral with applicable counterparties if crude oil prices change by specified amounts the company provided cash collateral of 

965 million to its fuel derivative counterparties as of december 31 2008 which decreased to 780 million as of january 19 2009 primarily due to the settlement of december 2008 contracts for more information on our aircraft fuel hedges see note 13 “fair value measurements and derivative instruments” in combined notes to consolidated financial statements and item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

 

the company’s current plans to address increased fuel prices and the weak global economy may not be successful in improving its results of operations and liquidity in addition the implementation of certain of these plans require the use of cash for such items as severance payments lease termination fees conversion of ted aircraft and facility closure costs among others these cash requirements reduce the company’s cash available for its ongoing operations in addition the economic downturn may have an adverse impact on travel demand which may result in a negative impact on revenues and liquidity 

 

as described above the company is required to comply with certain financial covenants under its amended credit facility and certain of its credit card processing agreements the factors noted above among other things may impair the company’s ability to comply with these covenants or could allow certain of our credit card processors to increase the required reserves on our advance ticket sales which could have an adverse impact on the company’s financial position and liquidity depending on its ability to obtain a waiver of or otherwise mitigate the impact of the default if a default occurs under our amended credit facility the cost to cure any such default may adversely impact our financial position and liquidity 

 

our level of indebtedness our noninvestment grade credit rating and the current unfavorable credit market conditions may make it difficult for us to raise capital to meet liquidity needs and may increase our cost of borrowing a higher cost of capital could negatively impact our results of operations financial position and liquidity 

 

see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further information regarding the company’s liquidity 

 

economic and industry conditions constantly change and continued or worsening negative economic conditions in the united states and elsewhere may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

 

our business and results of operations are significantly impacted by general economic and industry conditions industrywide passenger air travel varies from year to year robust demand for our air transportation services depends largely on favorable general economic conditions including the strength of the global and local economies low unemployment levels strong consumer confidence levels and the availability of consumer and business credit for leisure travelers air transportation is often a discretionary purchase that those consumers can eliminate from their spending in difficult economic times in addition during periods of poor economic conditions businesses usually reduce the volume of their business travel either due to costsavings initiatives or as a result of decreased business activity requiring travel the overall demand for air transportation in the us has been negatively impacted by adverse changes and continued deterioration in the health of the us and global economies which negatively impacted our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2008 and could continue to have a significant negative impact on our future results of operations for an extended period of time since the end of 2008 the outlook for key economic indicators has deteriorated and credit card activity and advance bookings have not been as strong as in the prior year these factors are expected to negatively impact the company’s 2009 passenger and cargo revenues in addition decreases in cargo revenues due to lower demand have a disproportionate impact on our operating results as our cargo revenues generally have higher margins as compared to our passenger revenues continuation or worsening of the current global recession may lead the company and other carriers to further reduce domestic or international capacity and may have a material adverse effect on the company’s revenues results of operations and liquidity 

continued periods of historically high fuel costs or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a material adverse impact on the company’s operating results 

 

the company’s operating results have been and continue to be significantly impacted by changes in the supply or price of aircraft fuel both of which are impossible to predict the recordhigh fuel prices each year from 2005 through 2007 increased in 2008 to new record highs with the crude oil spot price reaching highs of approximately 145 per barrel in july of 2008 at times united has not been able to increase its fares when fuel prices have risen due to the highly competitive nature of the airline industry and it may not be able to do so in the future and such increases may not be sustainable in the highly competitive environment in addition fare increases may not totally offset the fuel price increase and may also reduce demand for air travel from time to time the company enters into hedging arrangements to protect against rising fuel costs the company’s hedging programs may use significant amounts of cash due to posting of cash collateral in some circumstances may not be successful in controlling fuel costs and may be limited due to market conditions and other factors see note 13 “fair value measurements and derivative instruments” in combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company’s hedging programs 

 

additional terrorist attacks or the fear of such attacks even if not made directly on the airline industry could negatively affect the company and the airline industry 

 

the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 involving commercial aircraft severely and adversely impacted the company’s financial condition and results of operations as well as prospects for the airline industry generally among the effects experienced from the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks were substantial flight disruption costs caused by the faaimposed temporary grounding of the us airline industry’s fleet significantly increased security costs and associated passenger inconvenience increased insurance costs substantially higher ticket refunds and significantly decreased traffic and revenue per revenue passenger mile “yield” 

 

additional terrorist attacks even if not made directly on the airline industry or the fear of or the precautions taken in anticipation of such attacks including elevated national threat warnings or selective cancellation or redirection of flights could materially and adversely affect the company and the airline industry the wars in iraq and afghanistan and additional international hostilities including heightened terrorist activity could also have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial condition liquidity and results of operations the company’s financial resources might not be sufficient to absorb the adverse effects of any further terrorist attacks or other international hostilities involving the united states or us interests 

 

the airline industry is highly competitive susceptible to price discounting and may undergo further bankruptcy restructuring or industry consolidation 

 

the us airline industry is characterized by substantial price competition especially in domestic markets some of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources or lowercost structures than united does or both in recent years the market share held by lowcost carriers has increased significantly large network carriers like united have often had a lack of pricing power within domestic markets 

 

during 2008 aloha airlines ata airlines eos airlines inc frontier airlines and skybus airlines all filed for bankruptcy protection other domestic and international carriers could restructure in bankruptcy or threaten to do so to reduce their costs carriers operating under bankruptcy protection can operate in a manner that could be adverse to the company and could emerge from bankruptcy as more vigorous competitors 

 

during 2008 the us airline industry underwent consolidation with the merger of delta airlines inc and northwest airlines there is ongoing speculation that further airline industry consolidation could occur in the future united routinely monitors changes in the competitive landscape and engages in analysis and discussions regarding its strategic position including alliances asset acquisitions and 

divestitures and business combinations in 2008 the company announced its agreement to form a strategic alliance with continental airlines this alliance may not realize all of the benefits of a merger the company may have future discussions with other airlines regarding mergers andor other strategic alternatives if other airlines participate in merger activity and united does not those airlines may significantly improve their cost structures or revenue generation capabilities thereby potentially making them stronger competitors of united 

 

in addition united and certain of its competitors announced significant capacity reductions during 2008 the company may not achieve necessary increases in unit revenue from the announced capacity reductions and unit costs may be adversely impacted by capacity reductions further certain of the company’s competitors may not reduce capacity or may increase capacity thereby diminishing our expected benefit from capacity reductions the poor economic environment may have an adverse impact on travel demand which may result in a negative impact on revenues 

 

additional security requirements may increase the company’s costs and decrease its revenues and traffic 

 

since september 11 2001 the dhs and the transportation security administration have implemented numerous security measures that affect airline operations and costs and are likely to implement additional measures in the future in addition foreign governments have also instituted additional security measures at foreign airports united serves a substantial portion of the costs of these security measures is borne by the airlines and their passengers increasing the company’s costs andor reducing its revenue and traffic additional measures taken to enhance either passenger or cargo security procedures andor to recover associated costs in the future may result in similar adverse effects on united’s results of operations 

 

extensive government regulation could increase the company’s operating costs and restrict its ability to conduct its business 

 

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that result in significant costs in addition to the enactment of the aviation security act laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce airline revenue the faa from time to time also issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require significant expenditures by united the company expects to continue incurring material expenses to comply with the regulations of the faa and other agencies 

 

united operates under a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the dot if the dot altered amended modified suspended or revoked our certificate it could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business the faa can also limit united’s airport access by limiting the number of departure and arrival slots at “high density traffic airports” and local airport authorities may have the ability to control access to certain facilities or the cost of access to such facilities which could have an adverse effect on the company’s business 

 

in addition access to landing and takeoff rights or “slots” at several major us airports and many foreign airports served by united are or recently have been subject to government regulation as passenger travel has continued to increase in recent years many us and foreign airports have become increasingly congested certain of united’s major hubs are among the more congested airports in the us and have been or could be the subject of regulatory action that might limit the number of flights andor increase costs of operations at certain times or throughout the day 

 

in addition the company’s operations may be adversely impacted due to the existing outdated air traffic control “atc” system utilized by the us government during peak travel periods in certain markets the current atc system’s inability to handle existing travel demand has led to shortterm capacity constraints imposed by government agencies as discussed above and has also resulted in delays and disruptions of traffic using the atc system in addition the current system will not be able to effectively handle projected future air traffic growth therefore imposition of these atc constraints on 

a longterm basis may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations failure to update the atc system in a timely manner and the substantial funding requirements of a modernized atc system that may be imposed on carriers like united may have an adverse impact on the company’s financial condition or results of operations 

 

many aspects of united’s operations are also subject to increasingly stringent federal state and local laws protecting the environment future environmental regulatory developments such as in regard to climate change in the us and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in the airline industry there are a few climate change laws and regulations that have gone into effect that apply to united including environmental taxes for certain international flights some limited greenhouse gas reporting requirements and some landbased planning laws which could apply to airports and ultimately impact airlines depending upon the circumstances in addition the eu has adopted legislation to include aviation within the eu’s existing greenhouse gas emission trading scheme effective in 2012 there are significant questions that remain as to the legality of applying the scheme to noneu airlines and the us and other governments are considering filing a legal challenge to the eu’s unilateral inclusion of noneu carriers while such a measure could significantly increase the costs of carriers operating in the eu the precise cost to united is difficult to calculate with certainty due to a number of variables and it is not clear whether the scheme will withstand legal challenge there may be future regulatory actions taken by the us government state governments within the us foreign governments the international civil aviation organization or through a new climate change treaty to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry such future regulatory actions are uncertain at this time in terms of either the regulatory requirements or their applicability to united but the impact to the company and its industry would likely be adverse and could be significant including the potential for increased fuel costs carbon taxes or fees or a requirement to purchase carbon credits 

 

the ability of us carriers to operate international routes is subject to change because the applicable arrangements between the united states and foreign governments may be amended from time to time or because appropriate slots or facilities may not be made available united currently operates on a number of international routes under government arrangements that limit the number of carriers capacity or the number of carriers allowed access to particular airports if an open skies policy were to be adopted for any of these routes such an event could have a material adverse impact on the company’s financial position and results of operations and could result in the impairment of material amounts of related tangible and intangible assets 

 

certain aspects of united’s proposed cooperation with continental through broad revenue and codesharing and other commercial cooperation and continental’s entry into the star alliance is subject to receipt of certain regulatory and other approvals and the termination of certain contractual relationships including continental’s existing agreements with skyteam members that restrict its participation in another global alliance the parties may not be successful in obtaining regulatory approval or the timing for termination of existing contractual relationships may be delayed 

 

the company’s plans to enter into or expand antitrust immunized joint ventures for various international regions involving continental united and other members of the star alliance are subject to receipt of approvals from applicable national authorities or otherwise satisfying applicable regulatory requirements and there can be no assurances that such approvals will be granted or applicable regulatory requirements will be satisfied other air carriers are also seeking to initiate or expand antitrust immunity for joint ventures which if approved could adversely affect the company’s financial position and results of operations 

 

further the company’s operations in foreign countries are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in those countries the company cannot provide any assurance that current laws and regulations or laws or regulations enacted in the future will not adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations 

the company’s results of operations fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors associated with the airline industry 

 

due to greater demand for air travel during the summer months revenues in the airline industry in the second and third quarters of the year are generally stronger than revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year the company’s results of operations generally reflect this seasonality but have also been impacted by numerous other factors that are not necessarily seasonal including among others the imposition of excise and similar taxes extreme or severe weather air traffic control congestion changes in the competitive environment due to industry consolidation and other factors and general economic conditions as a result the company’s quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year and historical operating results in a quarterly or annual period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 

 

the company may never realize the full value of its intangible assets or our longlived assets causing it to record impairments that may negatively affect its results of operations 

 

in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets “sfas 142” and statement of financial accounting standards no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets “sfas 144” the company is required to test certain of its intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis on october 1 of each year or more frequently if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred in addition the company is required to test certain of its tangible assets for impairment if conditions indicate that an impairment may have occurred 

 

during the second quarter of 2008 the company performed an interim impairment test of its goodwill all indefinitelived intangible assets and certain of its longlived assets principally aircraft and related spare engines and spare parts due to events and changes in circumstances that indicated an impairment might have occurred factors deemed by management to have collectively constituted a potential impairment triggering event included record high fuel prices significant losses in 2008 a softening us economy analyst downgrade of ual common stock rating agency changes in outlook for the company’s debt instruments from stable to negative the announcement in 2008 of the planned removal from ual’s fleet of 100 aircraft and a significant decrease in the fair value of the company’s outstanding equity and debt securities during 2008 including a decline in ual’s market capitalization to significantly below book value 

 

during the fourth quarter of 2008 the company performed its annual impairment test of intangible assets and determined that no additional impairment had occurred in addition due to certain conditions similar to those which triggered the second quarter 2008 impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2008 the company tested its b737 and b747 aircraft for additional impairment during the fourth quarter including evaluating the fair value of those aircraft already removed from service which resulted in additional impairment charges being recorded in the fourth quarter 

 

as a result of the impairment testing performed in the second and fourth quarters of 2008 the company recorded goodwill and tangible and intangible asset impairment charges totaling approximately 26 billion during 2008 the company determined that goodwill was completely impaired however the company still has book values at december 31 2008 of approximately 103 billion of operating property and equipment and 27 billion of intangible assets that could be subject to future impairment charges we may be required to recognize additional impairments in the future due to among other factors extreme fuel price volatility tight credit markets a decline in the fair value of certain tangible or intangible assets unfavorable trends in historical or forecasted operating or cash flow losses and the uncertain economic environment as well as other uncertainties the company can provide no assurance that a material impairment charge of tangible or intangible assets will not occur in a future period the value of our aircraft could be impacted in future periods by changes in the market for these aircraft such changes could result in a greater supply and lower demand for certain aircraft types as other 

carriers are also grounding aircraft an impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations in the period of recognition 

 

the company’s initiatives to improve the delivery of its products and services to its customers reduce costs increase its revenues and increase shareholder value including the operational plans recently initiated by the company may not be adequate or successful 

 

the company continues to identify and implement improvement programs to enhance the delivery of its products and services to its customers reduce its costs and increase its revenues in response to the unprecedented increase in fuel prices during 2008 and the weakening us and global economies the company began implementing certain operational plans the company’s efforts are focused on cost savings in areas such as telecommunications airport services catering maintenance materials aircraft ground handling and regional affiliates expenses among others in addition the company is significantly reducing mainline domestic and consolidated capacity and is removing 100 aircraft from its mainline fleet including its entire b737 fleet of 94 aircraft and six b747 aircraft united is also eliminating its ted product and reconfiguring that fleet’s 56 a320s to include united first class seats see item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further information regarding the company’s capacity reductions the company will continue to review the deployment of all of our aircraft in various markets and the overall composition of our fleet to ensure that we are using our assets appropriately to provide the best available return in connection with the capacity reductions the company is further streamlining its operations and corporate functions in order to match the size of its workforce to the size of its operations the company currently estimates a reduction of approximately 9000 positions during 2008 and 2009 through a combination of furloughs and furloughmitigation plans such as earlyout options there can be no assurance that the company’s initiatives to reduce costs and increase revenues will be successful 

 

the company is taking additional actions beyond the operational plans discussed above including increased cost reductions new revenue sources and other actions certain of the company’s plans to improve its performance require the use of significant cash for such items as severance payments lease termination fees conversion of ted aircraft and facility closure costs among others the company is also reviewing strategic alternatives to maximize the value of its assets and its businesses which may include a possible sale of all or part of these assets or operations there can be no assurance that any transactions with respect to these assets or operations will occur nor are there any assurances with respect to the form or timing of any such transactions or their actual effect on shareholder value a number of the company’s ongoing initiatives involve significant changes to the company’s business that it may be unable to implement successfully in addition revenue and other initiatives may not be successful due to the competitive landscape of the industry and the reaction of our competitors to certain of our initiatives the adequacy and ultimate success of the company’s programs and initiatives to improve the delivery of its products and services to its customers reduce its costs and increase both its revenues and shareholder value cannot be assured 

 

union disputes employee strikes and other laborrelated disruptions may adversely affect the company’s operations and impair its financial performance 

 

approximately 83 of the employees of ual are represented for collective bargaining purposes by us labor unions these employees are organized into six labor groups represented by six different unions 

 

relations between air carriers and labor unions in the united states are governed by the rla under the rla a carrier must maintain the existing terms and conditions of employment following the amendable date through a multistage and usually lengthy series of bargaining processes overseen by the national mediation board “nmb” this process continues until either the parties have reached agreement on a new collective bargaining agreement or the parties are released to “selfhelp” by the nmb although in most circumstances the rla prohibits strikes shortly after release by the nmb carriers and unions are free to engage in selfhelp measures such as strikes and lockouts all six of the 

company’s us labor agreements become amendable in january 2010 with negotiations between the company and the labor unions scheduled to commence during 2009 the company can provide no assurance that a successful or timely resolution of labor negotiations for all amendable agreements will be achieved there is also a risk that dissatisfied employees either with or without union involvement could engage in illegal slowdowns work stoppages partial work stoppages sickouts or other actions short of a full strike that could individually or collectively harm the operation of the airline and materially impair its financial performance 

 

increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage may adversely impact the company’s operations and financial results 

 

the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 led to a significant increase in insurance premiums and a decrease in the insurance coverage available to commercial airlines accordingly the company’s insurance costs increased significantly and its ability to continue to obtain certain types of insurance remains uncertain the company has obtained thirdparty war risk terrorism insurance through a special program administered by the faa resulting in lower premiums than if it had obtained this insurance in the commercial insurance market should the government discontinue this coverage obtaining comparable coverage from commercial underwriters could result in substantially higher premiums and more restrictive terms if it is available at all if the company is unable to obtain adequate war risk insurance its business could be materially and adversely affected 

 

if any of united’s aircraft were to be involved in an accident the company could be exposed to significant liability the insurance it carries to cover damages arising from any future accidents may be inadequate if the company’s insurance is not adequate it may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident 

 

the company relies heavily on automated systems to operate its business and any significant failure of these systems could harm its business 

 

the company depends on automated systems to operate its business including its computerized airline reservation systems flight operations systems telecommunication systems and commercial websites including unitedcom united’s website and reservation systems must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic and deliver important flight and schedule information as well as process critical financial transactions substantial or repeated website reservations systems or telecommunication systems failures could reduce the attractiveness of united’s services versus its competitors and materially impair its ability to market its services and operate its flights 

 

the company’s business relies extensively on thirdparty providers failure of these parties to perform as expected or unexpected interruptions in the company’s relationships with these providers or their provision of services to the company could have an adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations 

 

the company has engaged a growing number of thirdparty service providers to perform a large number of functions that are integral to its business such as operation of united express flights operation of customer service call centers provision of information technology infrastructure and services provision of aircraft maintenance and repairs provision of various utilities and performance of aircraft fueling operations among other vital functions and services the company does not directly control these thirdparty providers although it does enter into agreements with many of them that define expected service performance any of these thirdparty providers however may materially fail to meet their service performance commitments to the company the failure of these providers to adequately perform their service obligations or other unexpected interruptions of services may reduce the company’s revenues and increase its expenses or prevent united from operating its flights and providing other services to its customers in addition the company’s business and financial performance could be materially harmed if its customers believe that its services are unreliable or unsatisfactory 

the company’s high level of fixed obligations could limit its ability to fund general corporate requirements and obtain additional financing could limit its flexibility in responding to competitive developments and could increase its vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions 

 

the company has a significant amount of financial leverage from fixed obligations including its amended credit facility aircraft lease and debt financings leases of airport property and other facilities and other material cash obligations in addition as of december 31 2008 the company had pledged a substantial amount of its assets as collateral to secure its various fixed obligations the company’s high level of fixed obligations a downgrade in the company’s credit ratings or poor credit market conditions could impair its ability to obtain additional financing if needed and reduce its flexibility to conduct its business certain of the company’s existing indebtedness also requires it to meet covenants and financial tests to maintain ongoing access to those borrowings see note 12 “debt obligations and card processing agreements” in combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further details related to the company’s credit agreements and assets pledged as collateral a failure to timely pay its debts or other material uncured breach of its contractual obligations could result in a variety of adverse consequences including the acceleration of the company’s indebtedness the withholding of credit card sale proceeds by its credit card service providers and the exercise of other remedies by its creditors and equipment lessors that could result in material adverse effects on the company’s operations and financial condition in such a situation it is unlikely that the company would be able to fulfill its obligations to repay the accelerated indebtedness make required lease payments or otherwise cover its fixed costs 

 

the company’s net operating loss carry forward may be limited or possibly eliminated 

 

as of december 31 2008 the company had a net operating loss “nol” carry forward tax benefit of approximately 26 billion for federal and state income tax purposes that primarily originated before ual’s emergence from bankruptcy and will expire over a five to twenty year period this tax benefit is mostly attributable to federal pretax nol carry forwards of 70 billion if the company were to have a change of ownership within the meaning of section 382 of the internal revenue code under certain conditions its annual federal nol utilization could be limited to an amount equal to its market capitalization at the time of the ownership change multiplied by the federal longterm tax exempt rate a change of ownership under section 382 of the internal revenue code is defined as a cumulative change of 50 percentage points or more in the ownership positions of certain stockholders owning 5 or more of the company’s common stock over a three year rolling period 

 

to reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect on the company’s ability to utilize its nol carry forward for federal income tax purposes ual’s restated certificate of incorporation contains a “5 ownership limitation” applicable to all stockholders except the pension benefit guaranty corporation “pbgc” the 5 ownership limitation remains effective until february 1 2011 the 5 ownership limitation prohibits i the acquisition by a single stockholder of shares representing 5 or more of the common stock of ual corporation and ii any acquisition or disposition of common stock by a stockholder that already owns 5 or more of ual corporation’s common stock unless prior written approval is granted by the ual board of directors the percentage ownership of a single stockholder can be computed by dividing the number of shares of common stock held by the stockholder by the sum of the shares of common stock issued and outstanding plus the number of shares of common stock still held in reserve for payment to unsecured creditors under the plan of reorganization for additional information regarding the 5 ownership limitation please refer to ual’s restated certificate available on its website 

 

while the purpose of these transfer restrictions is to prevent a change of ownership from occurring within the meaning of section 382 of the internal revenue code which ownership change might materially and adversely affect the company’s ability to utilize its nol carry forward or other tax attributes no assurance can be given that such an ownership change will not occur in which case the availability of the company’s substantial nol carry forward and other federal income tax attributes might be significantly limited or possibly eliminated any transfers of common stock that are made in violation of the restrictions set forth above will be void and pursuant to ual’s restated certificate of 

incorporation will be treated as if such transfer never occurred this provision may prevent a sale of common stock by a stockholder or adversely affect the price at which a stockholder can sell common stock and consequently make it more difficult for a stockholder to sell shares of common stock in addition this limitation may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of ual creating a perception that a change in control cannot occur or otherwise discouraging takeover attempts that some stockholders may consider beneficial which could also adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock ual cannot predict the effect that this provision in the ual restated certificate of incorporation may have on the market price of the common stock 

 

the company is subject to economic and political instability and other risks of doing business globally 

 

the company is a global business with operations outside of the united states from which it derives approximately onethird of its operating revenues as measured and reported to the dot the company’s operations in asia latin america the middle east and europe are a vital part of its worldwide airline network volatile economic political and market conditions in these international regions may have a negative impact on the company’s operating results and its ability to achieve its business objectives in addition significant or volatile changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies and the imposition of exchange controls or other currency restrictions may have a material adverse impact upon the company’s liquidity revenues costs and operating results 

 

the company could be adversely affected by an outbreak of a disease that affects travel behavior 

 

an outbreak of a disease that affects travel demand or travel behavior such as severe acute respiratory syndrome “sars” or avian flu or other illness could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

 

certain provisions of ual’s governance documents could discourage or delay changes of control or changes to the board of directors of ual 

 

certain provisions of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws of ual the “governance documents” may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of ual’s board of directors and may discourage takeover attempts that some of its stockholders may consider beneficial 

 

certain provisions of the governance documents may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if ual’s board of directors determines that such changes in control are not in the best interests of ual and its stockholders 

 

these provisions of the governance documents are not intended to prevent a takeover but are intended to protect and maximize the value of ual’s stockholders’ interests while these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of ual to negotiate with the ual board of directors they could enable the board of directors to prevent a transaction that some or a majority of its stockholders might believe to be in their best interests and in that case may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

 

the issuance of ual’s contingent senior unsecured notes could adversely impact results of operations liquidity and financial position and could cause dilution to the interests of its existing stockholders 

 

in connection with the company’s emergence from chapter 11 bankruptcy protection ual is obligated under an indenture to issue to the pbgc 8 senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principal amount of up to 500 million in up to eight equal tranches of 625 million with no more than one tranche issued as a result of each issuance trigger event upon the occurrence of certain financial triggering events an issuance trigger event occurs when the company’s ebitdar as defined in the indenture exceeds 35 billion over the prior twelve months ending june 30 or december 31 of any applicable fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ending december 31 2009 and ending with the fiscal year ending december 31 2017 however if the issuance of a tranche would cause a default under any 

other securities then existing ual may satisfy its obligations with respect to such tranche by issuing ual common stock having a market value equal to 625 million the issuance of these notes could adversely impact the company’s results of operations because of increased interest expense related to the notes and adversely impact its financial position or liquidity due to increased cash required to meet interest and principal payments if common stock is issued in lieu of debt this could cause additional dilution to existing ual stockholders see risks related to ual’s common stock below for additional information regarding other risks related to our common stock 

 

risks related to ual’s common stock

ual’s certificate of incorporation limits voting rights of certain foreign persons 

 

ual’s restated certificate of incorporation limits the total number of shares of equity securities held by persons who are not “citizens of the united states” as defined in section 40102a15 of title 49 united states code to no more than 249 of the aggregate votes of all equity securities outstanding this restriction is applied pro rata among all holders of equity securities who fail to qualify as “citizens of the united states” based on the number of votes the underlying securities are entitled to

air cargopassenger surcharge investigations 

 

in february 2006 the european commission the “commission” and the us department of justice “doj” commenced an international investigation into what government officials described as a possible price fixing conspiracy relating to certain surcharges included in tariffs for carrying air cargo doj issued a grand jury subpoena to united and the commission conducted an inspection at the company’s offices in frankfurt in june 2006 united received a second subpoena from the doj requesting information related to certain passenger pricing practices and surcharges applicable to international passenger routes we are cooperating fully united is considered a source of information for the doj investigation not a target 

 

separately united has received information requests regarding cargo pricing matters from the competition authorities in australia brazil japan korea and switzerland on december 18 2007 the commission issued a statement of objections to 26 companies including united the statement of objections presented evidence related to the utilization of fuel and security surcharges and the exchange of pricing information that the commission views as supporting the conclusion that an illegal pricefixing cartel had been in operation in the air cargo transportation industry united has provided written and oral responses vigorously disputing the commission’s allegations against the company on july 31 2008 state prosecutors in sao paulo brazil commenced criminal proceedings against eight individuals including united’s cargo manager for allegedly participating in cartel activity the company is actively participating in the defense of those allegations on december 15 2008 the new zealand commerce commission issued notices of proceeding and statements of claim to 13 airlines including united the company is currently preparing its response to these proceedings 

 

in addition to the government investigations united and other air cargo carriers were named as defendants in over ninety class action lawsuits alleging civil damages as a result of the purported air cargo pricing conspiracy those lawsuits were consolidated for pretrial activities in the united states federal court for the eastern district of new york on june 20 2006 united entered into an agreement with the majority of the private plaintiffs to dismiss united from the class action lawsuits in return for an agreement to cooperate with the plaintiffs’ factual investigation and united is no longer named as a defendant in the consolidated civil lawsuit the company is reviewing whether its receipt of a statement of objections from the commission will impact the civil litigation 

multiple putative class actions were also filed alleging violations of the antitrust laws with respect to the passenger pricing practices which were the subject of the doj subpoena those lawsuits were consolidated for pretrial activities in the united states federal court for the northern district of california “federal court” united was dismissed from the case on october 3 2008 

 

the company is currently cooperating with all ongoing investigations and analyzing whether any potential liability may result from any of the investigating bodies based on its evaluation of all information currently available the company has determined that no reserve for potential liability is required and will continue to defend itself against all allegations that it was aware of or participated in cartel activities however penalties for violation of competition laws can be substantial and an ultimate finding that the company engaged in improper activity could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

overview 

 

as discussed above under item 1 business  the company derives virtually all of its revenues from airline related activities the most significant source of airline revenues is passenger revenues however mileage plus united cargo and united services are also major sources of operating revenues the airline industry is highly competitive and is characterized by intense price competition fare discounting by united’s competitors has historically had a negative effect on the company’s financial results because united has generally been required to match competitors’ fares to maintain passenger traffic future competitive fare adjustments may negatively impact the company’s future financial results the company’s most significant operating expense is jet fuel jet fuel prices are extremely volatile and are largely uncontrollable by the company the company’s historical and future earnings have been and will continue to be significantly impacted by jet fuel prices 

 

this annual report on form 10k is a combined report of ual and united as ual consolidates united for financial statement purposes disclosures that relate to activities of united also apply to ual unless otherwise noted united’s operating revenues and operating expenses comprise nearly 100 of ual’s revenues and operating expenses in addition united comprises approximately the entire balance of ual’s assets liabilities and operating cash flows therefore the following qualitative discussion is applicable to both ual and united unless otherwise noted any significant differences between ual and united results are separately disclosed and explained united meets the conditions set forth in general instruction i1a and b of form 10k and is therefore filing this form 10k with the reduced disclosure format allowed under that general instruction 

 

bankruptcy matters on december 9 2002 ual united and 26 direct and indirect whollyowned subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions to reorganize its business under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code the company emerged from bankruptcy on february 1 2006 under a plan of reorganization that was approved by the bankruptcy court in connection with its emergence from chapter 11 bankruptcy protection the company adopted freshstart reporting which resulted in significant changes in postemergence financial statements as compared to the company’s historical financial statements see the “financial results” section below for further discussion see note 4 “voluntary reorganization under chapter 11” in combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding bankruptcy matters 

 

recent developments the unprecedented increase in fuel prices and a worsening global recession have created an extremely challenging environment for the airline industry while the company significantly improved its financial performance in 2006 and 2007 the company was not able to financially compensate for the substantial increase in fuel prices during 2008 the company’s average consolidated fuel price per gallon including net hedge losses that are classified in fuel expense increased 59 from 2007 to 2008 the increased cost of fuel purchases and hedging losses drove the 31 billion increase in the company’s consolidated fuel costs the company’s fuel hedge losses that are classified in nonoperating expense also had a significant negative impact on its 2008 liquidity and results of operations 

 

although the company was adversely impacted by fuel costs and special items in this recessionary environment the company’s commitment to cost reduction was a contributory factor to the yearoveryear reduction in other areas of operating expenses as presented in the table below the 

following table presents the unit cost of various components of total operating expenses and yearoveryear changes 

 

 

 

  

in 2008 the company focused on mitigating a portion of the negative impact of higher fuel costs and the weakening economy through cost reductions fleet optimization generation of higher revenues executing on initiatives to enhance liquidity and other strategies as discussed below overall the company has characterized its business approach as “focus on five” which refers to a comprehensive set of priorities that focus on the fundamentals of running a good airline one that runs on time with clean planes and courteous employees that delivers industryleading revenues and competitive costs and does so safely building on this foundation united aims to regain its industryleading position in key metrics reported by the dot as well as industryleading revenue driven by products services schedules and routes that are valued by the company’s customers the goal of this approach is intended to enable united to achieve bestinclass safety performance exceptional customer satisfaction and experience and industryleading margin and cash flow although results of operations in 2008 were disappointing and economic conditions continue to present a challenge for the company we believe we are taking the necessary steps to position the company for improved financial and operational performance in 2009 

 

some of these actions include the following 

 

 38 

 

 39 

  

  

the company also took certain actions to maintain adequate liquidity and minimize its financing costs during this challenging economic environment during 2008 the company generated unrestricted cash of approximately 19 billion through new financing agreements amendments to our mileage plus cobranded credit card agreement and our largest credit card processing agreement and other means some of these agreements are summarized below see liquidity and capital resources—financing activities  below for additional information related to these agreements 

 

  

the company also made the following significant changes to its international route network

financial results ual and united adopted freshstart reporting in accordance with sop 907 upon emerging from bankruptcy thus the consolidated financial statements before february 1 2006 reflect results based upon the historical cost basis of the company while the postemergence consolidated financial statements reflect the new basis of accounting which incorporates fair value and other adjustments recorded from the application of sop 907 therefore financial statements for the postemergence periods are not comparable to the preemergence period financial statements references to “successor company” refer to ual andor united on or after february 1 2006 after giving effect to the adoption of freshstart reporting references to “predecessor company” refer to ual andor united before their exit from bankruptcy on february 1 2006 

 

for purposes of the discussion of financial results management utilizes the combined results of the successor company and predecessor company for the twelve months ended december 31 2006 the combined results for the twelve months ended december 31 2006 are nongaap measures however management believes that the combined results provide a more meaningful comparison to the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 

 

the air travel business is subject to seasonal fluctuations and historically the company’s results of operations are better in the second and third quarters as compared to the first and fourth quarters of each year since our first and fourth quarter results normally reflect weaker travel demand the company’s results of operations can be impacted by adverse weather air traffic control delays fuel price volatility and other factors in any period 

the table below presents certain financial statement items to provide an overview of the company’s financial performance for the three years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 the most significant contributors to the company’s net loss in 2008 were increased fuel prices and asset impairments the table below also highlights that the company through its past and ongoing cost reduction initiatives was able to effectively manage costs in nonfuel and other areas although the benefits of these cost savings initiatives and higher revenues were not sufficient to offset the dramatic increase in fuel cost 

 

summary results of operations

additional details of significant variances in 2008 as compared to 2007 results as presented in the table above include the following 

 

  

 

 

  

liquidity the following table provides a summary of the company’s cash restricted cash and shortterm investments at december 31 2008 and 2007 

 

 

 

the decrease in the company’s cash restricted cash and shortterm investments balances was primarily due to a 34 billion unfavorable reduction in cash flows from operations in 2008 as compared to 2007 the operating cash decrease was primarily due to increased cash expenses mainly fuel and fuel hedge cash settlements as discussed below under results of operations  fuel hedge collateral requirements also used operating cash of approximately 965 million in the year ended december 31 2008 this unfavorable variance was partly offset by approximately 600 million of proceeds received from the amendment of the cobrand credit card agreement as discussed above restricted cash 

decreased in 2008 primarily due to an amendment to our largest credit card processing agreement and posting of letters of credit as further discussed below 

 

the increase in net cash used by investing activities was primarily due to a reallocation of excess cash from shortterm investments to cash and cash equivalents investing cash flows benefited from a reduction in restricted cash of 484 million this benefit was primarily due to the amendment of the credit card processing agreement in association with the cobranded amendment described above which decreased restricted cash by 357 million and the substitution of letters of credit for cash deposits related to workers’ compensation obligations in addition ual financing outflows included approximately 253 million to pay a 215 per common share special distribution in january 2008 

 

the company expects its cash flows from operations and its available capital to be sufficient to meet its future operating expenses lease obligations and debt service requirements in the next twelve months however the company’s future liquidity could be impacted by increases or decreases in fuel prices fuel hedge collateral requirements inability to adequately increase revenues to offset high fuel prices softening revenues resulting from reduced demand failure to meet future debt covenants and other factors see the liquidity and capital resources and item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  below for a discussion of these factors and the company’s significant operating investing and financing cash flows 

 

capital commitments at december 31 2008 the company’s future commitments for the purchase of property and equipment include approximately 24 billion of nonbinding aircraft commitments and 06 billion of binding commitments the nonbinding commitments of 24 billion are related to 42 a319 and a320 aircraft these orders may be cancelled which would result in the forfeiture of 91 million of advance payments provided to the manufacturer united believes it is highly unlikely that it will take delivery of the remaining aircraft in the future and therefore believes it will be required to forfeit its 91 million of advance delivery deposits based on this determination the company recorded an impairment charge in 2008 to decrease the value of the deposits and related capitalized interest of 14 million to zero in the company’s statements of consolidated financial position  in addition the company’s capital commitments include commitments related to its international premium cabin enhancement program during 2008 the company reduced the scope of this project by six aircraft from the originally disclosed number of 97 aircraft as of december 31 2008 the company had completed upgrades on 25 aircraft and had remaining capital commitments to complete enhancements on an additional 66 aircraft for further details see note 14 “commitments contingent liabilities and uncertainties” in combined notes to consolidated financial statements 

 

contingencies during the course of its chapter 11 proceedings the company successfully reached settlements with most of its creditors and resolved most pending claims against the debtors we are a party to numerous longterm agreements to lease certain airport and maintenance facilities that are financed through taxexempt municipal bonds issued by various local municipalities to build or improve airport and maintenance facilities united was advised during its restructuring that these municipal bonds may have been unsecured or in certain instances partially secured prepetition debt in 2006 certain of united’s lax municipal bond obligations were conclusively adjudicated through the bankruptcy court as financings and not true leases however there remains pending litigation to determine the value of the security interests if any that the bondholders have in our underlying leaseholds see note 4 “voluntary reorganization under chapter 11” in combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on this matter and the resolution of the separate sfo municipal bond matter in 2008 

 

united has guaranteed 270 million of the city and county of denver colorado special facilities airport revenue bonds united air lines project series 2007a the “denver bonds” this guarantee replaces our prior guarantee of 261 million of bonds issued by the city and county of denver colorado in 1992 these bonds are callable by united the outstanding bonds and related guarantee are not recorded in the company’s statements of consolidated financial position  however the related lease 

agreement is accounted for on a straightline basis resulting in a ratable accrual of the final 270 million payment over the lease term 

 

legal and environmental the company has certain contingencies resulting from litigation and claims incident to the ordinary course of business management believes after considering a number of factors including but not limited to the information currently available the views of legal counsel the nature of contingencies to which the company is subject and prior experience that the ultimate disposition of the litigation and claims will not materially affect the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations when appropriate the company accrues for these matters based on its assessments of the likely outcomes of their eventual disposition the amounts of these liabilities could increase or decrease in the near term based on revisions to estimates relating to the various claims 

 

the company anticipates that if ultimately found liable its damages from claims arising from the events of september 11 2001 could be significant however the company believes that under the air transportation safety and system stabilization act of 2001 its liability will be limited to its insurance coverage 

 

the company continues to analyze whether any potential liability may result from air cargopassenger surcharge cartel investigations following the receipt of a statement of objections that the european commission the “commission” issued to 26 companies on december 18 2007 the statement of objections sets out evidence related to the utilization of fuel and security surcharges and exchange of pricing information that the commission views as supporting the conclusion that an illegal pricefixing cartel had been in operation in the air cargo transportation industry united received a copy of the statement of objections and has provided written and oral responses vigorously disputing the commission’s allegations against the company nevertheless united will continue to cooperate with the commission’s ongoing investigation based on its evaluation of all information currently available the company has determined that no reserve for potential liability is required and will continue to defend itself against all allegations that it was aware of or participated in cartel activities however penalties for violation of european competition laws can be substantial and a finding that the company engaged in improper activity could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

 

many aspects of united’s operations are subject to increasingly stringent federal state and local laws protecting the environment future environmental regulatory developments such as in regard to climate change in the us and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in the airline industry there are a few climate change laws and regulations that have gone into effect that apply to united including environmental taxes for certain international flights some limited greenhouse gas reporting requirements and some landbased planning laws which could apply to airports and ultimately impact airlines depending upon the circumstances in addition the eu has adopted legislation to include aviation within the eu’s existing greenhouse gas emission trading scheme effective in 2012 there are significant questions that remain as to the legality of applying the scheme to noneu airlines and the us and other governments are considering filing a legal challenge to the eu’s unilateral inclusion of noneu carriers while such a measure could significantly increase the costs of carriers operating in the eu the precise cost to united is difficult to calculate with certainty due to a number of variables and it is not clear whether the scheme will withstand legal challenge there may be future regulatory actions taken by the us government state governments within the us foreign governments the international civil aviation organization or through a new climate change treaty to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry such future regulatory actions are uncertain at this time in terms of either the regulatory requirements or their applicability to united but the impact to the company and its industry would likely be adverse and could be significant including the potential for increased fuel costs carbon taxes or fees or a requirement to purchase carbon credits

results of operations 

 

operating revenues 

 

2008 compared to 2007 

 

the table below illustrates the yearoveryear percentage change in ual and united operating revenues 

 

 

 

the 2007 special item of 45 million relates to an adjustment of the estimated obligation associated with certain bankruptcy administrative claims of which 37 million and 8 million relates to the mainline and united express reporting units respectively the table below presents selected ual and united passenger revenues and operating data from our mainline segment broken out by geographic region with an associated allocation of the special item and from our united express segment expressed as yearoveryear changes 

 

 

 

  

in 2008 revenues for both mainline and united express benefited from yield increases of 69 and 50 respectively as compared to 2007 the yield increases are due to industry capacity reductions and fare increases including fuel surcharges plus incremental revenues derived from merchandising and fees however the benefit of higher yields was partially offset by 63 and 39 decreases in traffic for the mainline and united express segments respectively consolidated passenger revenues in 2008 included an unfavorable variance compared to 2007 that was partly due to the change in the mileage plus expiration policy for inactive accounts from 36 months to 18 months that provided a consolidated estimated annual benefit of 246 million in 2007 in addition the weak economic environment negatively impacted demand and passenger revenues particularly in the fourth quarter of 2008 

 

international prasm was up 24 yearoveryear with a related capacity increase of 09 while latin american prasm growth was strong at 90 yearoveryear it is not a significant part of united’s international network atlantic performance was driven by lower than average revenue growth in our london and germany markets largely due to industry capacity growth of approximately 13 in the us to london heathrow route and united’s 15 growth in germany these markets account for approximately 75 of our atlantic capacity the pacific region was impacted by 7 industry capacity growth between the us and china  hong kong which account for approximately 45 of united’s pacific capacity 

cargo revenues increased by 84 million or 11 in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to higher fuel surcharges and improved fleet utilization in addition revenues were higher due to increased volume associated with the us domestic mail contract which commenced in late april 2007 as well as filling new capacity in international markets a weaker dollar also benefited cargo revenues in 2008 as a significant portion of cargo services are contracted in foreign currencies however the company experienced a significant decline in cargo revenues in the fourth quarter of 2008 due to rationalization of international capacity falling demand for domestic and international air cargo as the global economy softened and lower fuel costs driving lower fuel surcharges in late 2008 decreased cargo revenues resulting from lower demand have a disproportionate impact on our operating results because cargo revenues typically generate higher margins as compared to passenger revenues 

 

the fullyear 2008 trends in passenger and cargo revenues are not indicative of the company’s most recent fourth quarter revenue results in the fourth quarter of 2008 mainline passenger revenues decreased approximately 10 due to lower traffic as a result of the company’s 12 capacity reduction and lower demand due to the weak global economy the 2008 capacity reductions planned 2009 capacity reductions and weak us and global economies are expected to negatively impact revenues in 2009 in late 2008 and early 2009 the company has experienced decreased travel bookings and lower credit card sales activity which have resulted from the weak global economy and have negatively affected revenues and are expected to continue to negatively impact revenues in 2009 the company cannot predict the longevity or severity of the current weak global economy and therefore cannot accurately estimate the negative impact it will have on future revenues 

 

other revenues decreased approximately 11 in 2008 as compared to 2007 this decrease was primarily due to lower jet fuel sales to third parties the decrease in third party fuel sales had a negligible impact on our operating margin because the associated cost of sales decreased by a similar amount in 2008 as compared to 2007 

 

2007 compared to 2006 

 

the table below illustrates the yearoveryear percentage changes in ual and united operating revenues the primary difference between ual and united revenues is due to other revenues at ual which are generated from minor direct subsidiaries of ual 

 

 

 

 47 

 

the table below presents selected ual and united passenger revenues and operating data from our mainline segment broken out by geographic region and from our united express segment expressed as yearoveryear changes passenger revenues presented below include the effects of the 45 million special revenue items on mainline 37 million and united express 8 million revenue which resulted directly from the company’s ongoing efforts to resolve certain bankruptcy preconfirmation contingencies 

 

 

 

  

including the special revenue items mainline and united express passenger revenues increased by 924 million and 170 million respectively in 2007 as compared to 2006 in 2007 mainline revenues benefited from a 06 point increase in load factor and a 7 increase in yield as compared to 2006 in the same periods united express load factor was relatively flat while yield and traffic both increased 3 resulting in the 6 increase in revenue overall passenger revenues increased due to a better revenue environment for the industry which was partly due to industrywide capacity constraint the company’s shift of some capacity and traffic from domestic to higher yielding international flights also benefited revenues in 2007 in addition the change in the mileage plus expiration period policy also contributed to the increase in revenues in 2007 mileage plus revenue included in passenger revenues was approximately 169 million higher in 2007 this impact was largely due to a change in the mileage plus expiration period policy from 36 months to 18 months as discussed in critical accounting policies  below mileage plus customer accounts are deactivated after 18 months of inactivity effective december 31 2007 severe winter storms in december 2007 had the estimated impact of reducing revenue by 25 million similarly winter storms in december 2006 had an estimated impact of reducing revenue by 40 million 

 

cargo revenues increased by 20 million or 3 in the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to the same period in 2006 freight revenue increased due to both higher yields and higher volume this increase was partially offset by a reduction in mail revenue due to lower 2007 volume as a result of the termination of the us postal service “usps” contract on june 30 2006 united signed a new usps contract effective april 2007 

 

ual other operating revenues decreased by 311 million or 24 in the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to the same period in 2006 lower jet fuel sales to third parties by our subsidiary uafc accounted for 307 million of the other revenue decrease this decrease in jet fuel sales was due to several factors including decreased uafc sales to our regional affiliates our decision not to renew various low margin supply agreements to other carriers and decreased sales of excess inventory this decrease had no material impact on the company’s operating margin because uafc cost of sales decreased by 306 million in the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to the prior year 

operating expenses 

 

2008 compared to 2007 

 

the table below includes data related to ual and united operating expenses significant fluctuations are discussed below 

 

 

 

the increase in aircraft fuel expense and regional affiliates expense was primarily attributable to increased market prices for crude oil and related fuel products as highlighted in table below which presents several key variances for mainline and regional affiliate aircraft fuel expense in the 2008 period as compared to the yearago period 

 

 

 

  

salaries and related costs increased 50 million in 2008 the company’s costs in 2008 include the negative impact of average wage increases and higher benefits expense as well as severance expense of 106 million due to the implementation of the company’s operating plans as more fully explained in note 2 “company operational plans” in combined notes to consolidated financial statements in addition the company recorded 87 million of expense in 2008 from certain benefit obligation 

adjustments which were primarily due to discount rate changes these negative impacts were partially offset by lower combined profit and success sharing expense in the 2008 period as compared to the yearago period due to the unfavorable financial results in 2008 as compared to 2007 in addition 2008 salaries and related costs benefited from the workforce reductions completed during the year as discussed in overview above 

 

regional affiliate expense increased 307 million or 10 in 2008 as compared to the same period last year regional affiliate expense increased primarily due to a 342 million or 37 increase in regional affiliate fuel that was driven by an increase in market price for fuel as highlighted in the fuel table above the regional affiliate operating loss was 150 million in 2008 period as compared to income of 122 million in 2007 due to the aforementioned fuel impacts which could not be fully offset by higher ticket prices as regional affiliate revenues were only 1 higher in 2008 

 

the company’s purchased services increased 29 million or 2 in 2008 as compared to 2007 in 2008 purchased services included a charge of 26 million related to certain projects and transactions being terminated or indefinitely postponed in 2008 other areas of purchased services did not change significantly as compared to 2007 

 

aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs decreased 6 in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to a decrease in engine and airframe maintenance associated with the retirement of the company’s b737 fleet and more favorable engine maintenance contract rates 

 

depreciation expense in 2008 was adversely impacted by 34 million of accelerated depreciation primarily related to the retirement of certain b737 and b747 aircraft and related parts and a 20 million charge to increase the inventory obsolescence reserve this adverse impact was partially offset by reduced amortization expense in 2008 related to certain of the company’s intangible assets that were fully amortized in 2007 

 

ual landing fees and other rent decreased 2 in 2008 due to a reduction in the amount of facilities rented based upon our ongoing efforts to optimize our rented facilities consistent with our operational needs 

 

distribution expenses decreased 9 in 2008 as compared to 2007 largely due to the company’s reduction of some of its travel agency commission programs in 2008 resulting in an average commission rate reduction in addition the company’s lower passenger revenues due to its capacity reductions in 2008 also contributed to the decrease in related distribution expenses 

 

cost of third party sales decreased 14 yearoveryear primarily due to a reduction in uafc expenses this decrease is consistent with the reduction in uafc revenues 

 

the company’s other operating expenses decreased 5 in 2008 compared to the yearago period this decrease was partly due to a 29 million litigationsettlement gain which was recorded in other operating expenses and decreases in several other expense categories which resulted from the company’s cost reduction program 

 

asset impairments and special items 

 

as described in combined notes to consolidated financial statements  in accordance with sfas 142 and sfas 144 as of may 31 2008 the company performed an interim impairment test of its goodwill all intangible assets and certain of its longlived assets principally aircraft predelivery deposits aircraft and related spare engines and spare parts due to events and changes in circumstances during the first five months of 2008 that indicated an impairment might have occurred in addition the company also performed an impairment test of certain aircraft fleet types as of december 31 2008 because unfavorable market conditions for aircraft indicated potential impairment of value the company also performed annual indefinitelived intangible asset impairment testing at october 1 2008 as a result of all of its impairment testing the company recorded asset impairment charges of 26 billion as summarized in the table below all of these impairment charges are within the mainline segment all of 

the impairments other than the goodwill impairment which is separately identified are classified as “other impairments and special items” in the company’s statements of consolidated operations see note 3 “asset impairments and intangible assets” in combined notes to consolidated financial statements and critical accounting policies for additional information including factors considered by management in concluding that a triggering event under sfs 142 and sfas 144 had occurred and additional details of assets impaired 

 

the lease termination and other charges of 25 million primarily relate to the accrual of future rents for the b737 leased aircraft that have been removed from service and charges associated with the return of certain of these aircraft to their lessors 

 

 

 

the company recorded special operating expense credits of 44 million in 2007 these items have been classified as special because they are directly related to the resolution of bankruptcy administrative claims and are not indicative of the company’s ongoing financial performance see 2007 compared to 2006  below for a discussion of these bankruptcyrelated special items and note 4 “voluntary reorganization under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code” in combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on pending matters related to the company’s bankruptcy 

 

2007 compared to 2006 

 

the table below includes the yearoveryear dollar and percentage changes in ual and united operating expenses significant fluctuations are discussed below 

 

 

 

 51 

 

mainline aircraft fuel increased 179 million or 4 in the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 2006 this net fuel variance was due to a 4 increase in the average price per gallon of jet fuel from 211 in 2006 to 218 in 2007 resulting from unfavorable market conditions included in the 2007 average price per gallon was an 83 million net hedge gain a net fuel hedge loss of 26 million is included in the 2006 average price per gallon 

 

ual salaries and related costs remained relatively flat in 2007 as compared to 2006 the company recognized 49 million of sharebased compensation expense in 2007 as compared to 159 million in 2006 there were no significant grants in 2007 as compared to 2006 which included a large number of grants associated with the company’s emergence from bankruptcy additionally immediate recognition of 100 of the cost of awards granted to retirementeligible employees on the grant date together with accelerated vesting of grants within the first twelve months after the grant date accounted for most of the decrease in sharebased compensation expense also benefiting the 2007 period was the absence of the 22 million severance charge incurred in 2006 offsetting the decreased sharebased compensation and severance expense was a slight increase in salaries and related costs as a result of certain wage increases as well as a 110 million increase in profit sharing including related employee taxes which is based on annual pretax earnings as noted above this increase is due to increased pretax earnings and an increase in the payout percentage from 75 in 2006 to 15 in 2007 

 

regional affiliate expense which includes aircraft fuel increased 117 million or 4 during 2007 as compared to 2006 regional affiliate capacity increased 4 in 2007 which was a major contributor to the increase in expense including the special revenue item of 8 million our regional affiliate operating income was 53 million higher in the 2007 period as compared to the 2006 period the margin improvement was due to improved revenue performance which was due to increased yield and traffic and cost control factors impacting regional affiliate margin include the restructuring of regional carrier capacity agreements the replacement of some 50seat regional jets with 70seat regional jets and regional carrier network optimization all of these improvements were put in place throughout 2006 therefore we realized some yearoveryear benefits in 2007 regional affiliate fuel expense increased 81 million or 10 from 834 million in 2006 to 915 million in 2007 due to a 9 increase in the average price of fuel and a 1 increase in consumption 

 

purchased services increased 8 in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to increased information technology and other costs incurred in support of the company’s customer and employee initiatives information technology expenses increased due to an increase in noncapitalizable information technology related expenditures generally occurring during the planning and scoping phases for new applications in 2007 in addition airport operations handling and security costs increased due to the new usps contract and new international routes among other factors 

 

aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs expense increased 157 million or 16 yearoveryear primarily due to inflationary increases related to our v2500 engine maintenance contract and the cost of component parts as well as the impact of increases in airframe and engine repair volumes 

 

a charge of 18 million in 2007 for surplus and obsolete aircraft parts inventory accounted for approximately half of the 4 increase in depreciation and amortization 

 

ongoing efforts to efficiently utilize our rented facilities have offset contractual rent increases keeping 2007 rent expense in line with 2006 rent expense 

 

in 2007 united’s mainline revenues increased by 6 during the same period of time distribution expenses which include commissions gds fees and credit card fees decreased 2 from 798 million in 2006 to 779 million in 2007 this decrease was due to cost savings realized as the company continues to drive reductions across the full spectrum of costs of sale impact areas included renegotiation of contracts with various channel providers rationalization of commission plans and programs and continued emphasis on movement of customer purchases toward lower cost channels including online channels such efforts resulted in a 9 yearoveryear reduction in gds fees and commissions 

the decrease in cost of sales in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to lower uafc third party fuel sales of 307 million as described in the discussion of revenue variances above 

 

special items of 44 million in the year ended december 31 2007 include a 30 million benefit due to the reduction in recorded accruals for pending bankruptcy litigation related to our sfo and lax municipal bond obligations and a 14 million benefit due to the company’s ongoing efforts to resolve certain other bankruptcy preconfirmation contingencies in the eleven months ended december 31 2006 special items of 36 million included a 12 million benefit to adjust the company’s recorded obligation for the sfo and lax municipal bonds and a 24 million benefit related to preconfirmation pension matters the 2007 and 2006 special items resulted from revised estimates of the probable amount to be allowed by the bankruptcy court and were recorded in accordance with aicpa practice bulletin 11 accounting for preconfirmation contingencies in freshstart reporting  see note 4 “voluntary reorganization under chapter 11” and note 19 “special items” in combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on these special items and pending bankruptcy matters 

 

other income expense 

 

2008 compared to 2007 

 

the following table illustrates the yearoveryear dollar and percentage changes in ual and united other income expense 

 

 

 

ual interest expense decreased 138 million or 21 in 2008 as compared to 2007 the 2008 period was favorably impacted by 15 billion of total credit facility prepayments and the february 2007 credit facility amendment which lowered united’s interest rate on these obligations scheduled debt obligation repayments throughout 2008 and 2007 also reduced interest expense in 2008 as compared to 2007 the company has a significant amount of variablerate debt lower benchmark interest rates on these variablerate borrowings also reduced the company’s interest expense in 2008 as compared to 2007 interest expense in 2007 included the writeoff of 17 million of previously capitalized debt issuance costs associated with the february 2007 amended credit facility partial prepayment 6 million of financing costs associated with the february 2007 amendment and a gain of 22 million from a debt extinguishment the benefit of lower interest expense in 2008 was offset by a 145 million decrease in interest income due to lower average cash and shortterm investment balances and lower investment yields see liquidity and capital resources below for further details related to financing activities 

 

nonoperating fuel hedge gains losses relate to hedging instruments that are not classified as economic hedges these net hedge gains losses are presented separately in the table above for purposes of additional analysis these hedging gains losses are due to favorable unfavorable movements in crude oil prices relative to the fuel hedge instrument terms see item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note 13 “fair value measurements and derivative instruments” in combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these hedges 

there were no significant investment gains or losses in 2008 as compared to 2007 during which the company recorded a 41 million gain on sale of investment as discussed below under 2007 compared to 2006 

 

the 24 million variance in miscellaneous net is primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations in 2008 

 

2007 compared to 2006 

 

the following table illustrates the yearoveryear dollar and percentage changes in other income expense 

 

 

 

  

ual interest expense decreased 109 million or 14 in 2007 as compared to 2006 the decrease was due to the february and december 2007 amendments and prepayments of the amended credit facility which lowered united’s interest rate on these obligations and reduced the total obligations outstanding by approximately 15 billion repayments of scheduled maturities of debt obligations and other debt refinancings which are discussed in “liquidity and capital resources” below also reduced interest expense the 2007 period also included a 22 million reduction in interest expense due to the recognition of a gain on debt extinguishment these benefits were offset by interest expense of 17 million for expensing previously capitalized debt issuance costs that were associated with the february 2007 prepayment of the amended credit facility and 6 million for financing costs incurred in connection with the february amendment of the amended credit facility the 500 million amended credit facility prepayment in december 2007 increased interest expense by a net of 4 million from expensing 6 million of previously capitalized credit facility costs and recording a gain of 2 million to recognize previously deferred interest rate swap gains 

 

ual interest income increased 8 million or 3 yearoveryear interest income increased due to the classification of 6 million of interest income as reorganization items in the january 2006 predecessor period in accordance with sop 907 

 

the 41 million gain on sale of investment resulted from the company’s sale of its 211 interest in aeronautical radio inc “arinc” 

 

the unfavorable variances in miscellaneous income expense are primarily due to foreign currency transaction gains of 9 million in 2006 as compared to foreign currency transaction losses of 4 million in 2007 

 

income taxes 

 

the relatively small tax benefit recorded in 2008 is related to the impairment and sale of certain indefinitelived intangible assets partially offset by the impact of an increase in state tax rates ual 

recorded income tax expense of 297 million for the year ended december 31 2007 based an estimated effective tax rate of 43 see note 8 “income taxes” in combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

as of the date of this form 10k the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to fund its operations for the next twelve months including funding for scheduled repayments of debt and capital lease obligations capital expenditures cash deposits required under fuel hedge contracts and other contractual obligations we expect to meet our liquidity needs in 2009 from cash flows from operations cash and cash equivalents on hand proceeds from new financing arrangements using unencumbered assets and proceeds from aircraft sales and sales of other assets among other sources while the company expects to meet its future cash requirements in 2009 our ability to do so could be impacted by many factors including but not limited to the following 

 

  

 55 

 

  

  

although the factors described above may adversely impact the company’s liquidity the company believes it has an adequate available cash position to fund current operations ual’s unrestricted and restricted cash balances were 20 billion and 03 billion respectively at december 31 2008 in addition the company has recently taken actions to improve its liquidity and believes it may access additional capital or improve its liquidity further as described below 

 

  

cash position and liquidity as of december 31 2008 approximately 50 of the company’s cash and cash equivalents consisted of money market funds directly or indirectly invested in us treasury securities with the remainder largely in money market funds that are covered by the new government money market funds guarantee program there are no withdrawal restrictions at the present time on any of the money market funds in which the company has invested in addition the company has no auction rate securities as of december 31 2008 therefore we believe our credit risk is limited with respect to our cash balances the following table provides a summary of ual’s net cash provided used 

by operating financing investing and reorganization activities for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 and total cash position as of december 31 2008 and 2007 

 

 

 

 

 

the company’s cash and shortterm investment position represents an important source of liquidity the change in cash from 2006 to 2008 is explained below restricted cash primarily represents cash collateral to secure workers’ compensation obligations security deposits for airport leases and reserves with institutions that process our credit card ticket sales we may be required to post significant additional cash collateral to meet such obligations in the future the company has a 255 million revolving commitment under its amended credit facility of which 254 million and 102 million had been used for letters of credit as of december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively in addition under a separate agreement the company had 27 million of letters of credit issued as of december 31 2008 the increase of letters of credit issued in 2008 was primarily due to the providing of alternative collateral in place of restricted cash deposits thereby providing the company with additional unrestricted cash 

 

cash flows from operating activities 

 

2008 compared to 2007 

 

ual’s cash from operations decreased by approximately 34 billion in 2008 as compared to 2007 this decrease was primarily due to the increased cash required for fuel purchases and operating and nonoperating cash fuel hedge losses mainline and regional affiliate fuel costs increased 31 billion in 2008 over 2007 and nonoperating expenses also increased over the same period largely due to cash and noncash fuel hedge losses in addition certain counterparties to our fuel hedge instruments required the company to provide cash collateral deposits of approximately 965 million in 2008 which negatively impacted our cash flows during this period as compared to 2007 when no similar deposits were required a decrease in advance ticket sales also negatively impacted operating cash flow in 2008 partially offsetting the negative impacts were 500 million of proceeds from the advanced purchase of miles by our cobranded credit card partner as part of the amendment of our marketing agreement and 100 million of proceeds from the extension of the license previously granted to our cobranded credit card partner to be the exclusive issuer of mileage plus visa cards through 2017 in 2008 the company contributed approximately 240 million and 22 million to its defined contribution plans and nonus pension plans respectively as compared to contributions of 236 million and 14 million respectively in 2007 for these plans 

 

2007 compared to 2006 

 

the company’s cash from operations improved by more than 500 million yearoveryear the company’s improvement in net income excluding primarily noncash reorganization items was a significant factor contributing to the increase in operating cash flows operating cash flows for 2007 also include the favorable impact of an increase in noncash income tax expense of nearly 300 million as compared to 2006 in addition cash from operations improved due to a reduction of 124 million in cash interest payments in 2007 as compared to 2006 as a result of the financing activities completed in 

2007 to reduce debt and interest rates the improvement in cash generated from operations that was due to better operating performance was further enhanced by a decrease in operating cash used for working capital in 2007 the company contributed approximately 236 million and 14 million to its defined contribution plans and nonus pension plans respectively as compared to contributions of 270 million in 2006 for these plans 

 

cash flows from investing activities 

 

2008 compared to 2007 

 

net sales of shortterm investments provided cash of 23 billion for ual in 2008 as compared to cash used for net purchases of shortterm investments of 20 billion in 2007 in 2008 the company invested most of its excess cash in money market funds whereas in 2007 excess cash was largely invested in shortterm investments such as commercial paper during 2008 the company also received 357 million of cash that was previously restricted cash held by the company’s largest credit card processor the release of cash was part of an amendment to the company’s cobranded credit card agreement and largest credit card processor agreement see credit card processing agreements  below for further discussion of the amended agreement and future cash reserve requirements 

 

in 2008 cash expenditures for property equipment and software totaled approximately 455 million additions to property in 2008 also included 20 million of capitalized interest in 2007 cash expenditures for property and equipment software and capitalized interest were 639 million 65 million and 19 million respectively this yearoveryear decrease is primarily due to the company’s efforts to optimize its available cash and a reduction in cash used to acquire aircraft as the 2007 capital expenditures included cash used to acquire six aircraft that were previously financed as operating leases as discussed in 2007 compared to 2006  below 

 

during 2008 the company generated 94 million from various asset sales including the sale of five b737 aircraft spare parts engines and slots certain previously existing agreements in principle to sell additional aircraft in 2008 have been terminated 

 

investing cash of 274 million was generated from aircraft sold under saleleaseback financing agreements in 2008 united entered into a 125 million saleleaseback involving nine previously unencumbered aircraft and a 149 million saleleaseback involving 15 aircraft see note 15 “lease obligations” and note 16 “statement of consolidated cash flows—supplemental disclosures” in combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to these transactions in addition the company’s investing cash flows benefited from 41 million of cash proceeds from a litigation settlement resulting in the recognition of a 29 million gain during 2008 the litigation settlement related to predelivery advance aircraft deposits 

 

2007 compared to 2006 

 

ual’s cash released from restricted funds was 91 million in 2007 as compared to 357 million that was provided by a decrease in the segregated and restricted funds for ual in 2006 the significant cash generated from restricted accounts in 2006 was due to our improved financial position upon our emergence from bankruptcy net purchases of shortterm investments used cash of 20 billion for ual in 2007 as compared to cash used for net purchases of shortterm investments of 02 billion in 2006 this change was due to investing additional excess cash in longerterm commercial paper in 2007 to increase investment yields investing activities in 2007 also included the company’s use of 96 million of cash to acquire certain of the company’s previously issued and outstanding debt instruments the debt instruments repurchased by the company remain outstanding see note 12 “debt obligations and card processing agreements” in combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further information related to the 96 million of purchased debt securities 

 

the company’s capital expenditures were 658 million and 362 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively including the purchase of six aircraft during 2007 in the third quarter of 2007 the 

company purchased three 747400 aircraft that had previously been financed by united through operating leases which were terminated at closing the total purchase price for these aircraft was largely financed with certain proceeds from the secured eetc financing described below these transactions did not result in any change in the company’s fleet count of 460 mainline aircraft or in the amount of aircraft encumbered by debt or lease agreements 

 

during the fourth quarter of 2007 the company used existing cash to acquire three aircraft that were previously financed under operating lease agreements the total purchase price of these three aircraft and the three aircraft acquired in the third quarter of 2007 was approximately 200 million this purchase did not result in any change in the company’s fleet count of 460 mainline aircraft but did unencumber three aircraft 

 

in addition in the fourth quarter of 2007 the company utilized existing aircraft deposits pursuant to the terms of the original capital lease to make the final lease payments on three aircraft resulting in the reclassification of the aircraft from capital leased assets to owned assets however the purchase of these three aircraft did not result in a net change in cash because the company had previously provided cash deposits equal to the purchase price of the aircraft to third party financial institutions for the benefit of the lessor these transactions resulted in three additional aircraft becoming unencumbered for a total increase of six unencumbered aircraft during the year 

 

during 2007 the company sold its interest in arinc generating proceeds of 128 million in 2006 ual received 43 million more in cash proceeds from investing activities as compared to united primarily due to 56 million of proceeds from the sale of mypoints a former direct subsidiary of ual 

 

cash flows from financing activities 

 

2008 activity 

 

ual used 253 million for its special distribution to common stockholders united issued a 257 million dividend to ual for this distribution and 919 million for scheduled longterm debt and capital lease payments united used cash of 109 million in connection with an amendment to its amended credit facility as further discussed below in 2008 the company acquired ten aircraft that were being operated under existing leases these aircraft were acquired pursuant to existing lease terms aircraft lease deposits of 155 million provided financing cash that was primarily utilized by the company to make the final payments due under these lease obligations nine of these aircraft were previously recorded as capital leased assets and are now owned assets 

 

united completed a 241 million credit agreement secured by 26 of the company’s currently owned and mortgaged a319 and a320 aircraft borrowings under the agreement were at a variable interest rate based on libor plus a margin the agreement requires periodic principal and interest payments through its final maturity in june 2019 the company may not prepay the loan prior to july 2012 this agreement did not change the number of the company’s unencumbered aircraft as the company used available equity in these previously owned and mortgaged aircraft as collateral for this financing 

 

united also entered into an 84 million loan agreement secured by three aircraft including two airbus a320 and one boeing b777 borrowings under the agreement were at a variable interest rate based on libor plus a margin the loan requires principal and interest payments every three months and has a final maturity in june 2015 

 

the company issued 112 million shares of ual common stock as part of a 200 million equity offering during 2008 as of december 31 2008 the company had generated net proceeds of 107 million 

 

as of december 31 2008 62 aircraft with a net book value of approximately 570 million were unencumbered the unencumbered aircraft at december 31 2008 exclude nine aircraft which became encumbered with the december 2008 signing of a binding saleleaseback agreement that closed in january 2009 as of december 31 2007 the company had 113 unencumbered aircraft with a net book 

value of 20 billion see note 12 “debt obligations and card processing agreements” in combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on assets provided as collateral by the company 

 

see the cash flows from investing activities section  above for a discussion of the company’s 2008 saleleaseback transactions 

 

2007 activity 

 

in 2007 the company made a 10 billion prepayment on its amended credit facility and made 11 billion of additional debt payments which included 590 million related to the early retirement of debt the company prepaid an additional 500 million of the amended credit facility in december 2007 in addition the company completed a 694 million debt issuance which effectively refinanced the aforementioned early debt retirement and refinanced three aircraft that had been previously financed through operating lease agreements 

 

in 2007 the company completed financing transactions totaling approximately 964 million which included the 694 million eetc secured financing and the 270 million denver airport financing a portion of the proceeds of the 694 million eetc transaction was used to repay 590 million of debt obligations that were secured by ten previously mortgaged owned aircraft and to finance three previously unencumbered owned aircraft the proceeds of the denver airport bonds were used to refinance the former 261 million of denver series 1992a bonds 

 

in 2007 cash from aircraft lease deposits increased 80 million primarily due to the use of the deposits to purchase the three previously leased assets described above in cash flows from investing activities  this was reported as a financing cash inflow as the prepayment of the initial deposits were recorded as a financing cash outflow 

 

2006 activity 

 

during 2006 we generated proceeds of 30 billion from united’s new credit facility but used approximately 21 billion of these proceeds to repay the 12 billion dip financing and make other scheduled and revolving payments under longterm debt and capital lease agreements 

 

other 2008 and 2009 financing matters 

 

in january 2009 the company entered into a saleleaseback agreement of nine aircraft for approximately 95 million in addition in january 2009 the company generated net proceeds of 62 million from the issuance of 40 million shares and settlement of unsettled trades at december 31 2008 under its 200 million common stock distribution agreement after issuance of these shares the company had issued shares for gross proceeds of 172 million of the 200 million available under this stock offering leaving 28 million available for future issuance under this program 

 

in january 2009 the company entered into an amendment to its o’hare cargo building site lease with the city of chicago the company agreed to vacate its current cargo facility at o’hare to allow the land to be used for the development of a future runway in january 2009 the company received 160 million from o’hare in accordance with the lease amendment in addition the lease amendment requires that the city of chicago provide the company with another site at o’hare upon which a replacement cargo facility could be constructed 

 

future financing subject to the restrictions of its amended credit facility the company could raise additional capital by issuing unsecured debt equity or equitylike securities monetizing or borrowing against certain assets or refinancing existing obligations to generate net cash proceeds however the availability and capacity of these funding sources cannot be assured or predicted general economic conditions poor credit market conditions and any adverse changes in the company’s credit ratings could adversely impact the company’s ability to raise capital if needed and could increase the company’s cost of capital 

credit ratings in 2008 both standard  poor’s and moody’s investors services lowered the company’s credit ratings standard  poor’s lowered its ratings from a corporate credit rating of b outlook stable to b outlook negative reflecting expected losses and reduced operating cash flow due to volatile fuel prices meanwhile moody’s investor services lowered ual’s corporate family from “b2” to “caa1” with a negative outlook and its secured bank rating from “b1” to “b3” citing recordhigh fuel prices and the weak us economy these credit ratings are below investment grade levels downgrades from these rating levels among other things could restrict the availability andor increase the cost of future financing for the company 

 

amended credit facility covenants the company’s amended credit facility requires compliance with certain covenants the company was in compliance with all of its amended credit facility covenants as of december 31 2008 and 2007 in may 2008 the company amended the terms of certain financial covenants of the amended credit facility a summary of financial covenants after the may amendment is included below 

 

beginning with the second quarter of 2009 the company must maintain a specified minimum ratio of ebitdar to the sum of the following fixed charges for all applicable periods a cash interest expense and b cash aircraft operating rental expense ebitdar represents earnings before interest expense net of interest income income taxes depreciation amortization aircraft rent and certain other cash and noncash credits and charges as further defined by the amended credit facility the other adjustments to ebitdar include items such as foreign currency transaction gains or losses increases or decreases in our deferred revenue obligation sharebased compensation expense nonrecurring or unusual losses any noncash nonrecurring charge or noncash restructuring charge a limited amount of cash restructuring charges certain cash transaction costs incurred with financing activities and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 

 

the amended credit facility also requires compliance with the following financial covenants i a minimum unrestricted cash balance of 10 billion and ii a minimum ratio of market value of collateral to the sum of a the aggregate outstanding amount of the loans plus b the undrawn amount of outstanding letters of credit plus c the unreimbursed amount of drawings under such letters of credit and d the termination value of certain interest rate protection and hedging agreements with the amended credit facility lenders and their affiliates of 150 at any time or 200 at any time following the release of primary routes having an appraised value in excess of 1 billion unless the primary routes are the only collateral then pledged 

 

the requirement to meet a fixed charge coverage ratio was suspended for the four quarters beginning with the second quarter of 2008 and ending with the first quarter of 2009 and thereafter is determined as set forth below 

 

 

 

the amended credit facility contains a cross default provision with respect to other credit arrangements that exceed 50 million although the company was in compliance with all required financial covenants as of december 31 2008 and the company is not required to comply with a fixed charge coverage ratio until the three month period ending june 30 2009 continued compliance depends on many factors some of which are beyond the company’s control including the overall industry revenue environment and the level of fuel costs there are no assurances that the company will continue to comply with its debt covenants failure to comply with applicable covenants in any reporting period would result in a default under the amended credit facility which could have a material adverse impact 

on the company depending on the company’s ability to obtain a waiver of or otherwise mitigate the impact of the default 

 

credit card processing agreements the company has agreements with financial institutions that process customer credit card transactions for the sale of air travel and other services under certain of the company’s card processing agreements the financial institutions either require or have the right to require that united maintain a reserve equal to a portion of advance ticket sales that have been processed by that financial institution but for which the company has not yet provided the air transportation referred to as “relevant advance ticket sales” as of december 31 2008 the company had advance ticket sales of approximately 15 billion of which approximately 13 billion relates to credit card sales 

 

in november 2008 united entered into an amendment for its card processing agreement with paymentech and jpmorgan chase bank the “amendment” that suspends until january 20 2010 the requirement for united to maintain additional cash reserves with this processor of bank cards above the current cash reserve of 25 million at december 31 2008 if united’s monthend balance of unrestricted cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments falls below 25 billion in exchange for this benefit united has granted the processor a security interest in certain of united’s owned aircraft with a current appraised value of at least 800 million united also has agreed that such security interest collateralizes not only united’s obligations under the processing agreement but also united’s obligations under united’s amended and restated cobranded card marketing services agreement united has an option to terminate the amendment prior to january 20 2010 in which event the parties’ prior credit card processing reserve arrangements under the processing agreement will go back into effect 

 

after january 20 2010 or in the event united terminates the amendment and in addition to certain other risk protections provided to the processor the amount of any such reserve will be determined based on the amount of unrestricted cash held by the company as defined under the amended credit facility if the company’s unrestricted cash balance is more than 25 billion as of any calendar monthend measurement date its required reserve will remain at 25 million however if the company’s unrestricted cash is less than 25 billion its required reserve will increase to a percentage of relevant advance ticket sales as summarized in the following table 

 

 

 

  

if the november 2008 amendment had not been in effect as of december 31 2008 the company would have been required to post an additional 132 million of reserves based on an actual unrestricted cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments balance of between 20 billion and 25 billion at december 31 2008 

 

united’s card processing agreement with american express expired on february 28 2009 and was replaced by a new agreement on march 1 2009 which has an initial five year term as of december 31 2008 there were no required reserves under this card agreement and no reserves were required up through the date of expiration 

 

under the new agreement in addition to certain other risk protections provided to american express the company will be required to provide reserves based primarily on its unrestricted cash 

balance and net current exposure as of any calendar monthend measurement date as summarized in the following table 

 

 

 

  

the new agreement permits the company to provide certain replacement collateral in lieu of cash collateral as long as the company’s unrestricted cash is above 135 billion such replacement collateral may be pledged for any amount of the required reserve up to the full amount thereof with the stated value of such collateral determined according to the agreement replacement collateral may be comprised of aircraft slots and routes real estate or other collateral as agreed between the parties 

 

in the near term the company will not be required to post reserves under the new american express agreement as long as unrestricted cash as measured at each monthend and as defined in the agreement is equal to or above 20 billion 

 

if the terms of the new agreement had been in place at december 31 2008 and ignoring the near term protection in the preceding sentence the company would have been required to provide collateral of approximately 40 million 

 

an increase in the future reserve requirements as provided by the terms of either or both the company’s material card processing agreements could materially reduce the company’s liquidity 

 

capital commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements the company’s business is very capital intensive requiring significant amounts of capital to fund the acquisition of assets particularly aircraft in the past the company has funded the acquisition of aircraft through outright purchase by issuing debt by entering into capital or operating leases or through vendor financings the company also often enters into longterm lease commitments with airports to ensure access to terminal cargo maintenance and other required facilities 

 

the table below provides a summary of ual’s material contractual obligations as of december 31 2008 

 

 

 

  

see note 1i “summary of significant accounting policies—united express” note 9 “retirement and postretirement plans” note 12 “debt obligations and card processing agreements” and note 15 “lease obligations” in combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these items 

 

offbalance sheet arrangements an offbalance sheet arrangement is any transaction agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has 1 made guarantees 2 a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets 3 an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or 4 any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to the company or that engages in leasing hedging or research and development arrangements with the company the company’s offbalance sheet arrangements include operating leases which are summarized in the contractual obligations table above and certain municipal bond obligations as discussed below and letters of credit of which 281 million were outstanding at december 31 2008 

 

certain municipalities have issued municipal bonds on behalf of united to finance the construction of improvements at airportrelated facilities the company also leases facilities at airports where municipal bonds funded at least some of the construction of airportrelated projects at december 31 2008 the company guaranteed interest and principal payments on 270 million in principal of such bonds that were originally issued in 1992 subsequently refinanced in 2007 and are due in 2032 unless 

the company elects not to extend its lease in which case the bonds are due in 2023 the outstanding bonds and related guarantee are not recorded in the company’s statements of consolidated financial position in accordance with gaap the related lease agreement is accounted for as an operating lease with the associated rent expense recorded on a straightline basis the annual lease payments through 2023 and the final payment for the principal amount of the bonds are included in the operating lease payments in the contractual obligations table above for further details see note 14 “commitments contingent liabilities and uncertainties—guarantees and offbalance sheet financing” in combined notes to consolidated financial statements  

 

fuel consortia the company participates in numerous fuel consortia with other carriers at major airports to reduce the costs of fuel distribution and storage interline agreements govern the rights and responsibilities of the consortia members and provide for the allocation of the overall costs to operate the consortia based on usage the consortia and in limited cases the participating carriers have entered into longterm agreements to lease certain airport fuel storage and distribution facilities that are typically financed through taxexempt bonds either special facilities lease revenue bonds or general airport revenue bonds issued by various local municipalities in general each consortium lease agreement requires the consortium to make lease payments in amounts sufficient to pay the maturing principal and interest payments on the bonds as of december 31 2008 approximately 12 billion principal amount of such bonds were secured by significant fuel facility leases in which united participates as to which united and each of the signatory airlines have provided indirect guarantees of the debt united’s exposure is approximately 226 million principal amount of such bonds based on its recent consortia participation the company’s exposure could increase if the participation of other carriers decreases the guarantees will expire when the taxexempt bonds are paid in full which ranges from 2010 to 2028 the company did not record a liability at the time these indirect guarantees were made 

 

other information 

 

foreign operations the company’s statements of consolidated financial position reflect material amounts of intangible assets related to the company’s pacific and latin american route authorities and its operations at london’s heathrow airport because operating authorities in international markets are governed by bilateral aviation agreements between the us and foreign countries changes in us or foreign government aviation policies can lead to the alteration or termination of existing air service agreements that could adversely impact and significantly impair the value of our international route authorities and other assets significant changes in such policies could also have a material impact on the company’s operating revenues and expenses and results of operations for further information see note 3 “asset impairments and intangible assets” in combined notes to consolidated financial statements item 1 business—international regulation and item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures above market risk for further information on the company’s foreign currency risks associated with its foreign operations 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

critical accounting policies are defined as those that are affected by significant judgments and uncertainties which potentially could result in materially different accounting under different assumptions and conditions the company has prepared the accompanying financial statements in conformity with gaap which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions the company has identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of these financial statements 

 

passenger revenue recognition the value of unused passenger tickets and miscellaneous charge orders “mcos” is included in current liabilities as advance ticket sales united records passenger ticket sales and tickets sold by other airlines for use on united as operating revenues when the transportation is provided or when the ticket expires tickets sold by other airlines are recorded at the estimated values 

to be billed to the other airlines nonrefundable tickets generally expire on the date of the intended flight unless the date is extended by notification from the customer on or before the intended flight date fees charged in association with changes or extensions to nonrefundable tickets are recorded as passenger revenue at the time the fee is collected change fees related to nonrefundable tickets are considered a separate transaction from the air transportation because they represent a charge for the company’s additional service to modify a previous reservation therefore the pricing of the change fee and the initial customer reservation are separately determined and represent distinct earnings processes refundable tickets expire after one year mcos can be either exchanged for a passenger ticket or refunded after issuance united records an estimate of tickets that have been used but not recorded as revenue due to system processing errors as revenue in the month of sale based on historical results united also records an estimate of mcos that will not be exchanged or refunded as revenue ratably over the redemption period based on historical results due to complex industry pricing structures refund and exchange policies and interline agreements with other airlines certain amounts are recognized as revenue using estimates both as to the timing of recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized these estimates are based on the evaluation of actual historical results 

 

accounting for frequent flyer program miles sold to third parties and the advanced purchase of miles the company has an agreement with its cobranded credit card partner that requires our partner to purchase miles in advance of when miles are awarded to the cobranded partner’s cardholders referred to as “prepurchased miles” the prepurchased miles are deferred when received by united in our statements of consolidated financial position as “advanced purchase of miles” the company amended its agreement with its cobranded credit card partner in 2008 see note 17 “advanced purchase of miles” in combined notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of this agreement and its 2008 amendment subsequently when our credit card partner awards prepurchased miles to its cardholders we transfer the related air transportation element for the awarded miles from “advanced purchase of miles” to “mileage plus deferred revenue” at estimated fair value and record the residual marketing element as “other operating revenue” the deferred revenue portion is then subsequently recognized as passenger revenue when transportation is provided in exchange for the miles awarded accounting for the company’s air transportation element and marketing elements are described below 

 

other frequent flyer accounting policies 

 

air transportation element the company defers the portion of the sales proceeds that represents estimated fair value of the air transportation and recognizes that amount as revenue when transportation is provided the fair value of the air transportation component is determined based upon the equivalent ticket value of similar fares on united and amounts paid to other airlines for miles the initial revenue deferral is presented as “mileage plus deferred revenue” on our statements of consolidated financial position when recognized the revenue related to the air transportation component is classified as “passenger revenues” in our statements of consolidated operations  

 

marketingrelated element the amount of revenue from the marketingrelated element is determined by subtracting the fair value of the air transportation from the total sales proceeds the residual portion of the sales proceeds related to marketing activities is recognized when miles are awarded this portion is recognized as “other operating revenues” in our statements of consolidated operations 

 

the company’s frequent flyer obligation was recorded at fair value at february 1 2006 the effective date of the company’s emergence from bankruptcy the deferred revenue measurement method used to record fair value of the frequent flyer obligation on and after the effective date is to allocate an equivalent weightedaverage ticket value to each outstanding mile based upon projected redemption patterns for available award choices when such miles are consumed such value is estimated assuming redemptions on both united and other participating carriers in the mileage plus program and by estimating the relative proportions of awards to be redeemed by class of service within broad geographic regions of the company’s operations including north america atlantic pacific and latin america 

the estimation of the fair value of each award mile requires the use of several significant assumptions for which significant management judgment is required for example management must estimate how many miles are projected to be redeemed on united versus on other airline partners since the equivalent ticket value of miles redeemed on united and on other carriers can vary greatly this assumption can materially affect the calculation of the weightedaverage ticket value from period to period 

 

management must also estimate the expected redemption patterns of mileage plus customers who have a number of different award choices when redeeming their miles each of which can have materially different estimated fair values such choices include different classes of service first business and several coach award levels as well as different flight itineraries such as domestic and international routings and different itineraries within domestic and international regions of united’s and other participating carriers’ route networks customer redemption patterns may also be influenced by program changes which occur from time to time and introduce new award choices or make material changes to the terms of existing award choices management must often estimate the probable impact of such program changes on future customer behavior which requires the use of significant judgment management uses historical customer redemption patterns as the best single indicator of future redemption behavior in making its estimates but changes in customer mileage redemption behavior to patterns which are not consistent with historical behavior can result in material changes to deferred revenue balances and to recognized revenue 

 

the company measures its deferred revenue obligation using all awarded and outstanding miles regardless of whether or not the customer has accumulated enough miles to redeem an award eventually these customers will accumulate enough miles to redeem awards or their accounts will deactivate after a period of inactivity in which case the company will recognize the related revenue through its revenue recognition policy for expired miles 

 

the company recognizes revenue related to expected expired miles over the estimated redemption period the company’s estimate of the expected expiration of miles requires significant management judgment in early 2007 the company announced that it was reducing the expiration period for inactive accounts from 36 months to 18 months effective december 31 2007 the change in the expiration period increased revenues by 246 million in 2007 current and future changes to expiration assumptions or to the expiration policy or to program rules and program redemption opportunities may result in material changes to the deferred revenue balance as well as recognized revenues from the program in 2008 the company updated certain of its assumptions related to the recognition of revenue for expiration of miles based on additional analysis of mileage redemption and expiration patterns the company revised the estimated number of miles that are expected to expire from 15 to 24 of earned miles including miles that will expire or go unredeemed for reasons other than account deactivation in 2008 the company also extended the total time period over which revenue from its expiration of miles is recognized based upon the estimated period of miles redemption this change did not materially impact the company’s mileage plus revenue recognition in 2008 

 

as of december 31 2008 and 2007 the company’s outstanding number of miles was approximately 4782 billion and 4884 billion respectively the company estimates that approximately 3620 billion of the outstanding miles at december 31 2008 will ultimately be redeemed based on assumptions as of december 31 2008 at december 31 2008 a hypothetical 1 change in the company’s outstanding number of miles or the weightedaverage ticket value has approximately a 50 million effect on the liability 

 

impairment testing in accordance with sfas 142 and sfas 144 as of may 31 2008 the company performed an interim impairment test of its goodwill all intangible assets and certain of its longlived assets principally aircraft and related spare engines and spare parts due to events and changes in circumstances that indicated an impairment might have occurred the company also performed annual impairment testing of indefinitelived intangible assets as of october 1 2008 and further tested the potential impairment of certain tangible assets as of december 31 2008 

factors deemed by management to have collectively constituted a potential impairment triggering event as of may 31 2008 included record high fuel prices significant losses in the first and second quarters of 2008 a softening us economy analyst downgrade of uaua common stock rating agency changes in outlook for the company’s debt instruments from stable to negative the announcement of the planned removal from ual’s fleet of 100 aircraft in 2008 and 2009 and a significant decrease in the fair value of the company’s outstanding equity and debt securities during the first five months of 2008 including a decline in ual’s market capitalization to significantly below book value the company’s consolidated fuel expense increased by more than 50 during this period 

 

as a result of the interim impairment testing performed as of may 31 2008 and december 31 2008 the company recorded impairment charges during the year as presented in the table below all of these impairment charges are within the mainline segment all of the impairments other than the goodwill impairment which is separately identified are classified as “other impairments and special items” in the company’s statements of consolidated operations 

 

 

 

discussed below is the methodology used for each type of asset impairment shown in the table above 

 

accounting for longlived assets the net book value of operating property and equipment for ual was 103 billion and 114 billion at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively in addition to the original cost of these assets as adjusted by freshstart reporting as of february 1 2006 their recorded value is impacted by a number of accounting policy elections including the estimation of useful lives and residual values and when necessary the recognition of asset impairment charges 

 

for purposes of testing impairment of longlived assets at may 31 2008 the company determined whether the carrying amount of its longlived assets was recoverable by comparing the carrying amount to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets if the carrying value of the assets exceeded the expected cash flows the company estimated the fair value of these assets to determine whether an impairment existed the company grouped its aircraft by fleet type to perform this evaluation and used data and assumptions through may 31 2008 the estimated undiscounted cash flows were dependent on a number of critical management assumptions including estimates of future capacity passenger yield traffic operating costs including fuel prices and other relevant assumptions if estimates of fair value were required fair value was estimated using the market approach asset appraisals published aircraft pricing guides and recent transactions for similar aircraft were considered by the company in its market value determination as of may 31 2008 based on the results of these tests the company determined that an impairment of 36 million existed which was attributable to the company’s fleet of owned b737 aircraft and related spare parts as described in overview above the company is retiring its entire b737 fleet earlier than originally planned the company recorded an additional 2 million of impairment for other assets in the second quarter of 2008 subsequently in the fourth quarter of 2008 the company determined it was necessary to perform an impairment test of certain of its operating fleet due to changes in market conditions for aircraft which 

indicated a potential impairment of value this impairment analysis resulted in an additional fourth quarter impairment charge of 107 million related to the company’s b737 fleet this additional impairment charge was due to changes in market conditions and other conditions including but not limited to the cancellation of multiple letters of intent that the company had to sell b737 aircraft that occurred since the impairment testing performed in the second quarter of 2008 

 

due to the unfavorable economic and industry factors described above the company also determined in the second quarter of 2008 that it was required to test its 91 million of predelivery aircraft deposits for impairment the company determined that these aircraft deposits were completely impaired and recorded an impairment charge to writeoff their full carrying value and 14 million of related capitalized interest the company believes that it is highly unlikely that it will take these future aircraft deliveries and will therefore be required to forfeit the 91 million of deposits which are not transferable 

 

as a result of the impairment testing described above the company’s goodwill and certain of its indefinitelived intangible assets and tangible assets were recorded at fair value in accordance with fasb staff position no 1572  effective date of fasb statement no 157  the company has not applied statement of financial accounting standards no 157 fair value measurements “sfas 157” to the determination of the fair value of these assets however the provisions of sfas 157 were applied to the determination of the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities that were part of the sfas 142 step two goodwill fair value determination 

 

due to extreme fuel price volatility tight credit markets uncertain economic environment as well as other factors and uncertainties the company can provide no assurance that a material impairment charge of aircraft or indefinitelived intangible assets will not occur in a future period the value of our aircraft could be impacted in future periods by changes in the market for these aircraft such changes could result in a greater supply and lower demand for certain aircraft types as other carriers announce plans to retire similar aircraft the company will continue to monitor circumstances and events in future periods to determine whether additional interim asset impairment testing is warranted 

 

except for the adoption of freshstart reporting at february 1 2006 whereby the company remeasured longlived assets at fair value it is the company’s policy to record assets acquired including aircraft at acquisition cost depreciable life is determined through economic analysis such as reviewing existing fleet plans obtaining appraisals and comparing estimated lives to other airlines that operate similar fleets older generation aircraft are assigned lives that are generally consistent with the experience of united and the practice of other airlines as aircraft technology has improved useful life has increased and the company has generally estimated the lives of those aircraft to be 30 years residual values are estimated based on historical experience with regard to the sale of both aircraft and spare parts and are established in conjunction with the estimated useful lives of the related fleets residual values are based on current dollars when the aircraft are acquired and typically reflect asset values that have not reached the end of their physical life both depreciable lives and residual values are revised periodically to recognize changes in the company’s fleet plan and other relevant information a one year increase in the average depreciable life of our flight equipment would reduce annual depreciation expense on flight equipment by approximately 18 million 

 

accounting for goodwill and intangible assets upon the implementation of freshstart reporting see note 4 “voluntary reorganization under chapter 11—freshstart reporting” in combined notes to consolidated financial statements  the company’s assets liabilities and equity were generally valued at their respective fair values the excess of reorganization value over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities was recorded as goodwill in the accompanying statements of consolidated financial position on the effective date the entire goodwill amount of 23 billion at december 31 2007 was allocated to the mainline reporting segment in addition the adoption of freshstart reporting resulted in the recognition of 22 billion of indefinitelived intangible assets 

 

in accordance with sfas 142 the company applies a fair valuebased impairment test to the book value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets on an annual basis and if certain events or 

circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred on an interim basis an impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position and results of operations in the period of recognition the company tested its goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment during its annual impairment test as of october 1 2007 and as part of its interim test as of may 31 2008 the interim testing resulted in the total impairment of the company’s goodwill and partial impairment of other indefinitelived intangible assets the company also performed its annual interim test of indefinitelived intangible assets as of october 1 2008 

 

goodwill—2008 interim impairment test 

 

for purposes of testing goodwill the company performed step one of the sfas 142 test by estimating the fair value of the mainline reporting unit to which all goodwill is allocated utilizing several fair value measurement techniques including two market estimates and one income estimate and using relevant data available through and as of may 31 2008 the market approach is a valuation technique in which fair value is estimated based on observed prices in actual transactions and on asking prices for similar assets the valuation process is essentially that of comparison and correlation between the subject asset and other similar assets the income approach is a technique in which fair value is estimated based on the cash flows that an asset could be expected to generate over its useful life including residual value cash flows these cash flows are discounted to their present value equivalents using a rate of return that accounts for the relative risk of not realizing the estimated annual cash flows and for the time value of money certain variations of the income approach were used to determine certain of the intangible asset fair values 

 

under the market approaches the fair value of the mainline reporting unit was estimated based upon the fair value of invested capital for ual as well as a separate comparison to revenue and ebitdar multiples for similar publicly traded companies in the airline industry the fair value estimates using both market approaches included a control premium similar to those observed for historical airline and transportation company market transactions 

 

under the income approach the fair value of the mainline reporting unit was estimated based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows for ual the income approach is dependent on a number of critical management assumptions including estimates of future capacity passenger yield traffic operating costs including fuel prices appropriate discount rates and other relevant assumptions the company estimated its future fuelrelated cash flows for the income approach based on the fiveyear forward curve for crude oil as of may 31 2008 the impacts of the company’s aircraft and other tangible and intangible asset impairments discussed below were considered in the fair value estimation of the mainline reporting unit 

 

taking into consideration an equal weighting of the two market estimates and the income estimate which has been the company’s practice when performing annual goodwill impairment tests the indicated fair value of the mainline reporting unit was less than its carrying value and therefore the company was required to perform step two of the sfas 142 goodwill impairment test 

 

in step two of the impairment test the company determined the implied fair value of goodwill of the mainline reporting unit by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit determined in step one to all the assets and liabilities of the mainline reporting unit including any recognized and unrecognized intangible assets as if the mainline reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the mainline reporting unit was the acquisition price as a result of the step two testing the company determined that goodwill was completely impaired and therefore recorded an impairment charge to writeoff the full value of goodwill 

 

indefinitelived intangible assets 

 

the company utilized appropriate valuation techniques to separately estimate the fair values of all of its indefinitelived intangible assets as of may 31 2008 and compared those estimates to related carrying values tested assets included tradenames international route authorities london heathrow 

slots and codesharing agreements the company used a market or income valuation approach as described above to estimate fair values based on the preliminary results of this testing the company recorded 80 million of impairment charges during the second quarter of 2008 and in the third quarter of 2008 reduced the impairment charge by 16 million as a result of the finalization of the impairment testing no impairments of indefinitelived intangible assets resulted from the company’s annual impairment test performed as of october 1 2008 

 

other postretirement benefit accounting the company accounts for other postretirement benefits using statement of financial accounting standards no 106 employers’ accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions “sfas 106” and statement of financial accounting standards no 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans—an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r “sfas 158” for the year ended december 31 2006 the company adopted sfas 158 which requires the company to recognize the difference between plan assets and obligations or the plan’s funded status in its statements of consolidated financial position  under these accounting standards other postretirement benefit expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees’ approximate service periods and is generally calculated independently of funding decisions or requirements the company has not been required to prefund its current and future plan obligations which has resulted in a significant net obligation as discussed below 

 

the fair value of plan assets at december 31 2008 and 2007 was 57 million and 56 million respectively for the other postretirement benefit plans the benefit obligation was 20 billion for the other postretirement benefit plans at both december 31 2008 and 2007 the difference between the plan assets and obligations has been recorded in the statements of consolidated financial position  detailed information regarding the company’s other postretirement plans including key assumptions is included in note 9 “retirement and postretirement plans” in combined notes to consolidated financial statements  

 

the following provides a summary of the methodology used to determine the assumptions disclosed in note 9 “retirement and postretirement plans” in combined notes to consolidated financial statements  the calculation of other postretirement benefit expense and obligations requires the use of a number of assumptions including the assumed discount rate for measuring future payment obligations and the expected return on plan assets the discount rates were based on the construction of theoretical corporate bond portfolios adjusted according to the timing of expected cash flows for the payment of the company’s future postretirement obligations a yield curve was developed based on a subset of these bonds those with yields between the 10th and 90th percentiles the projected cash flows were matched to this yield curve and a present value developed which was then calibrated to develop a single equivalent riskadjusted discount rate 

 

actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions under the applicable accounting standards those gains and losses are not required to be recognized currently as other postretirement expense but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into expense over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees the company’s accounting policy is to not apply the corridor approach available under sfas 106 with respect to amortization of amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income under the corridor approach amortization of any gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income is only required if at the beginning of the year the accumulated gain or loss exceeds 10 of the greater of the benefit obligation or the fair value of assets if amortization is required the minimum amount outside the corridor divided by the average remaining service period of active employees is recognized as expense the corridor approach is intended to reduce volatility of amounts recorded in pension expense each year since the company has elected not to apply the corridor approach all gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are amortized and included in pension expense each year at december 31 2008 and 2007 the company had unrecognized actuarial gains of 286 million and 254 million respectively recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income for its other postretirement benefit plans 

valuation allowance for deferred tax assets at december 31 2008 the company had valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets of approximately 29 billion in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 109 accounting for income taxes  a valuation allowance is required to be recorded when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized future realization depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carry forward period available under the tax law sources of future taxable income include future reversals of taxable temporary differences future taxable income exclusive of reversing taxable differences taxable income in carry back years and tax planning strategies these sources of positive evidence of realizability must be weighed against negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years a recent history of losses would make difficult a determination that a valuation allowance is not needed 

 

in forming a judgment about the future realization of our deferred tax assets management considered both the positive and negative evidence of realizability and gave significant weight to the negative evidence from our cumulative losses for recent years management will continue to assess this situation and make appropriate adjustments to the valuation allowance based on its evaluation of the positive and negative evidence existing at that time we are currently unable to forecast when there will be sufficient positive evidence for us to reverse the remainder of the valuation allowances that we have recorded through december 31 2008 any reversals of valuation allowance would have reduced goodwill if any then intangible assets see note 1p “summary of significant accounting policies—new accounting pronouncements” for information regarding the effect of changes to this method of accounting for valuation allowance reversals if any on the company’s results of operations and financial condition after it adopts statement of financial accounting standards no 141 revised 2007 business combinations on january 1 2009 see note 8 “income taxes” in combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks united’s exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to its debt obligations and shortterm investments the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio united’s policy is to manage interest rate risk through a combination of fixed and variable rate debt and by entering into swap agreements depending upon market conditions a portion of united’s aircraft lease obligations and related accrued interest 306 million in equivalent us dollars at december 31 2008 is denominated in foreign currencies that expose the company to risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates to hedge against this risk united has placed foreign currency deposits 306 million in equivalent us dollars at december 31 2008 primarily for euros to meet foreign currency lease obligations denominated in that respective currency since unrealized marktomarket gains or losses on the foreign currency deposits are offset by the losses or gains on the foreign currency obligations united has hedged its overall exposure to foreign currency exchange rate volatility with respect to its foreign lease deposits and obligations the fair value of these deposits is determined based on the present value of future cash flows using an appropriate swap rate the fair value of longterm debt is predominantly based on the present value of future cash flows using a us treasury rate that matches the remaining life of the instrument adjusted by a credit spread and to a lesser extent on the quoted market prices for the same or similar instruments the table below presents information as of december 31 2008 about certain of the company’s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest and exchange rates amounts shown below are the same for both ual and united except as noted 

 

 

 

  

in addition to the cash equivalents included in the table above ual and united have 54 million and 50 million of shortterm restricted cash respectively and 218 million and 217 million respectively of longterm restricted cash as discussed in note 1d “summary of significant accounting policies—cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash” in combined notes to consolidated financial statements  this cash is being held in restricted accounts primarily for workers’ compensation obligations security deposits for airport leases and reserves with institutions that process united’s credit card ticket sales due to the short term nature of these cash balances their carrying values approximate their fair values the company’s interest income is exposed to changes in interest rates on these cash balances during 2007 the company also repurchased certain of its own debt instruments which remain outstanding and have a fair value and carrying value of 46 million at 

december 31 2008 the company recognizes changes in fair value of these securities through other comprehensive income however on a net basis the company is not exposed to market risk due to the existence of offsetting changes in the fair value of the company’s related debt obligations 

 

the material changes in the amounts reported in the table above for 2008 as compared to 2007 include the following 1 cash and shortterm investments decreased by approximately 15 billion primarily due to cash used for operating activities as discussed in liquidity above 2 lease deposits decreased by 190 million due to scheduled payments and aircraft acquisitions under lease agreement terms and 3 debt obligations decreased by 316 million primarily due to scheduled debt repayments in 2008 which were partially offset by new debt issuances in 2008 the interest rate on the company’s cash and variable rate debt decreased in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to a decrease in market interest rates 

 

commodity price risk jet fuel our results of operations and liquidity have been and may continue to be materially impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel and other oilrelated commodities and related derivative instruments when market conditions indicate risk reduction is achievable united may use commodity option contracts or other derivative instruments to reduce its price risk exposure to jet fuel the company’s derivative positions are typically comprised of crude oil heating oil and jet fuel derivatives the derivative instruments are designed to provide protection against increases in the price of aircraft fuel some derivative instruments may result in hedging losses if the underlying commodity prices drop below specified floors however the negative impact of these losses may be offset by the benefit of lower jet fuel acquisition cost since the company typically does not hedge all of its fuel consumption united may adjust its hedging program based on changes in market conditions at december 31 2008 the fair value of united’s fuelrelated derivatives was a payable of 867 million as compared to a receivable of 20 million at december 31 2007 the primary reason for this change was due to the dramatic spike in fuel prices through july 2008 and the subsequent fuel price decreases in the latter part of 2008 at december 31 2008 the fuel derivative payables includes 140 million related to pending settlements for purchased options and expired contracts 

 

as of december 31 2008 the company had hedged its forecasted consolidated fuel consumption as shown in the table below 

 

 

  

as presented in the table above in 2008 the company began modifying its fuel hedge portfolio by purchasing put options contracts to effectively cap losses on its short put option positions from further oil price decreases the company may take additional actions to reduce potential losses and collateral requirements that could arise from its short put option positions certain 3way collars and collars included in the table above have sold puts with twice the notional amount of the purchased calls the company’s exposure to losses should the positions settle below the put exercise price exceeds its potential benefit from price increases above the purchased call exercise price the company classifies gains losses resulting from these collar structures as nonoperating income expense as of december 31 2008 the company had hedged less than 1 of its 2010 forecasted fuel consumption 

 

the above derivative positions are subject to potential counterparty cash collateral requirements in some circumstances the company provided counterparties with cash collateral of 965 million as of december 31 2008 this collateral decreased to 780 million as of january 19 2009 primarily due to the settlement of the december 2008 contracts our counterparties may require greater amounts of collateral when the price of the underlying commodity decreases and lesser amounts when the price of the underlying commodity increases however the company has mitigated some of its exposure to larger collateral requirements by purchasing puts to cover its short put positions as presented in the table above the following table presents the company’s actual collateral position as of january 19 2009 and estimated fuel collateral position at the end of each quarter in 2009 based on the company’s january 16 2009 hedge positions and closing forward curve fuel prices 

 

 

 

because united had already posted significant amounts of collateral during 2008 the 2009 net cash impacts of the hedge settlements are not expected to be material based on january 16 2009 forward curve prices and the company’s january 16 2009 hedge position as hedges settle this collateral will be returned to cover cash settled losses the following table presents information regarding estimated fuel purchase cost and estimated cash requirements to meet fuel hedge losses based on the company’s actual collateral position as of january 19 2009 using closing forward fuel prices as of january 16 2009 and other factors 

 

 

 

 76 

 

actual collateral requirements fuel purchase costs and cash requirements for hedge losses will vary depending on changes in forward fuel prices modifications to the company’s fuel hedge portfolio and other factors the table below outlines the company’s estimated collateral provisions at various crude oil prices based on the hedge portfolio as of january 16 2009 

 

 

 

for example using the table above at an illustrative 35 per barrel at january 16 2009 the company’s required collateral provision to its derivative counterparties would be approximately 780 million 

 

foreign currency united generates revenues and incurs expenses in numerous foreign currencies such expenses include fuel aircraft leases commissions catering personnel expense advertising and distribution costs customer service expenses and aircraft maintenance changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the company’s results of operations through changes in the dollar value of foreign currencydenominated operating revenues and expenses 

 

despite the adverse effects a strengthening foreign currency may have on demand for usoriginating traffic a strengthening of foreign currencies tends to increase reported revenue and operating income because the company’s foreign currencydenominated operating revenue generally exceeds its foreign currencydenominated operating expense for each currency likewise despite the favorable effects a weakening foreign currency may have on demand for usoriginating traffic a weakening of foreign currencies tends to decrease reported revenue and operating income 

 

the company’s most significant net foreign currency exposures in 2008 based on exchange rates in effect at december 31 2008 are presented in the table below 

 

 

 

the company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31 2008 the company hedged a portion of its expected foreign currency cash flows in the australian dollar canadian dollar and european euro as of december 31 2008 the notional amount of these foreign currencies hedged with the forward contracts in us dollars was approximately 62 million based on contractual forward rates these contracts had a fair value of 10 million at december 31 2008 and expire at various dates through march 2009 as of december 31 2007 the notional amount of these foreign currencies hedged with the forward contracts in us dollars terms was approximately 346 million with a fair value of 1 million

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

operations 

segments the company operates its businesses through two reporting segments mainline and united express the company manages its business as an integrated network with assets deployed across integrated mainline and regional carrier networks this focus on managing the business seeks to maximize the profitability of the overall airline network financial information on the companys reporting segments and operating revenues by geographic regions as reported to the us department of transportation dot can be found in note 10 segment information in the combined notes to consolidated financial statements  

mainline mainline operating revenues were 170 billion in 2007 164 billion in 2006 and 150 billion and 149 billion for ual and united respectively in 2005 as of december 31 2007 mainline domestic operations served approximately 90 destinations primarily throughout the us and canada and operated hubs at chicago ohare international airport ohare denver international airport los angeles international airport lax san francisco international airport sfo and washington dulles international airport washington dulles mainline international operations serve the pacific atlantic and latin america regions the pacific region includes nonstop service to beijing hong kong nagoya osaka seoul shanghai sydney tokyo and taipei with service to guangzhou china scheduled to commence in june 2008 direct service to bangkok seoul and singapore via tokyo direct service to ho chi minh city and singapore via hong kong and to melbourne via sydney the atlantic region includes nonstop service to amsterdam brussels frankfurt kuwait city london munich paris rome and zurich the latin american region offers nonstop service to buenos aires sao paulo and direct service to rio de janeiro the latin american region also serves various mexico destinations including cancun cozumel seasonal mexico city puerto vallarta san jose del cabo and ixtapazihuatanejo seasonal various caribbean points

uals operating revenues attributed to mainline domestic operations were 109 billion in 2007 100 billion in 2006 and 90 billion in 2005 operating revenues attributed to mainline international operations were 61 billion in 2007 64 billion in 2006 and 60 billion in 2005 for purposes of the companys geographic revenue reporting the company considers destinations in mexico and the caribbean to be part of the latin america region as opposed to the north america region 

the mainline segment operated 460 aircraft as of december 31 2007 and produced approximately 142 billion available seat miles asms and 117 billion revenue passenger miles rpms during 2007 in 2006 the mainline segment produced approximately 143 billion asms and 117 billion rpms 

united express united express operating revenues were 31 billion in 2007 29 billion in 2006 and 24 billion in 2005 united has contractual relationships with various regional carriers to provide regional jet and turboprop service branded as united express united express is an extension of the united mainline network united ted and ps skywest airlines mesa airlines colgan airlines chautauqua airlines shuttle america trans states airlines gojet airlines and expressjet airlines are all united express carriers most of which operate under capacity purchase agreements under these agreements united pays the regional carriers contractuallyagreed fees carriercontrolled costs for operating these flights plus a variable reimbursement incentive payment based on agreed performance metrics the carriercontrolled costs are based on specific rates for various operating expenses of the united express carriers such as crew expenses maintenance and aircraft ownership some of which are multiplied by specific operating statistics eg block hours departures while others are fixed monthly amounts the incentive payment is a markup applied to the carriercontrolled costs for superior operational performance under these capacity agreements united is responsible for all fuel costs incurred as well as landing fees facilities rent and deicing costs which are passed through without any markup in return the regional carriers operate this capacity on schedules determined by united which also determines pricing revenues and inventory levels and assumes the inventory and distribution risk for the available seats 

the capacity agreements which united has entered into with united express carriers do not include the provision of ground handling services as a result united express sources ground handling support from a variety of thirdparty providers as well as by utilizing internal united resources in some cases 

while the regional carriers operating under capacity purchase agreements comprise over 95 of united express flying the company also has limited prorate agreements with skywest airlines and colgan airlines under these prorate agreements united and its prorate partners agree to divide revenue collected from each passenger according to a formula while both united and the prorate partners are individually responsible for their own costs of operations united also collects a program fee from colgan airlines to cover certain marketing and distribution costs such as credit card transaction fees global distribution systems gds transaction fees and frequent flyer costs unlike capacity purchase agreements these prorate agreements require the regional carrier to retain the control and risk of scheduling market selection seat pricing and inventory for its flights 

united express carriers operated 279 aircraft as of december 31 2007 and produced approximately 16 billion asms and 13 billion rpms during 2007 while producing approximately 16 billion asms and 12 billion rpms in 2006 

ted in february of 2004 united launched ted in denver to provide a tailored singleclass service including economy plus seating to better serve leisure destinations in the united network currently 56 a320 aircraft are configured for ted service ted provides service from uniteds five domestic hubs to destinations in arizona california florida louisiana nevada mexico and the 

caribbean as of december 31 2007 ted provided service from all of uniteds hubs to 11 destinations in the us including its territories and five in mexico 

united cargo united cargo offers both domestic and international shipping through a variety of services including united small package delivery express and general cargo services freight shipments comprise approximately 90 of united cargos volumes with mail comprising the remainder during 2007 united cargo accounted for approximately 4 of the companys operating revenues by generating 770 million in freight and mail revenue a 3 increase versus 2006 

united services united services is a global airline support business offering customers comprehensive aircraft maintenance repair and overhaul mro services which include engine maintenance maintenance of hightech components line maintenance and landing gear maintenance united services brings nearly 80 years of experience to serve approximately 110 airline customers worldwide during 2007 united services generated approximately 183 million in thirdparty revenue a 15 decrease as compared to 2006 as a result of the discontinuance of some low margin contracts revenues from ground handling and flight crew training services which were 67 million in 2006 are not classified as part of united services in 2007 

fuel since 2005 fuel has been the companys largest operating expense the companys annual mainline and united express fuel costs and consumption for 2007 and 2006 were as follows 



united express fuel expense is classified as regional affiliates expense in the statements of consolidated operations  

the price and availability of jet fuel significantly affect the companys results of operations a significant rise in jet fuel prices was the primary reason that the companys fuel expense increased in each of the last three years the company may not be able to offset all of any future fuel expense increases through higher revenues and the use of fuel hedge contracts 

to ensure adequate supplies of fuel and to provide a measure of control over fuel costs the company arranges to have fuel shipped on major pipelines and stored close to its major hub locations although the company currently does not anticipate a significant reduction in the availability of jet fuel a number of factors make predicting fuel prices and fuel availability uncertain including changes in world energy demand geopolitical uncertainties affecting energy supplies from oilproducing nations industrial accidents threats of terrorism directed at oil supply infrastructure extreme weather conditions causing temporary shutdowns of production and refining capacity and changes in relative demand for other petroleum products that may impact the quantity and price of jet fuel produced from period to period 

alliances united has entered into a number of bilateral and multilateral alliances with other airlines expanding travel choices for our customers through these relationships by participating in markets worldwide that united does not serve directly these marketing alliances typically include one or more of the following features joint frequent flyer program participation code sharing of flight operations whereby selected seats on one carriers flights can be marketed under the brand name of another carrier coordination of reservations ticketing passenger checkin baggage handling and flight schedules and other resourcesharing activities 

the most significant of these arrangements is the star alliance a global integrated airline network cofounded by united in 1997 as of february 1 2008 star alliance carriers serve nearly 900 destinations in 160 countries with over 17000 average daily flights current star alliance partners in addition to united are air canada air china air new zealand all nippon airways asiana the austrian airlines group bmi lot polish airlines lufthansa sas shanghai airlines singapore airlines south african airways spanair swiss tap portugal thai and us airways regional member carriers are adria airways slovenia blue1 finland and croatia airlines air india egyptair and turkish airlines have been accepted as future members and are expected to join the star alliance soon 

united also has independent marketing agreements with other air carriers including aloha gulfstream international great lakes aviation island air qatar airways taca group tam and virgin blue in february 2008 us airways and united reached final agreement on amendments to the contracts governing their code share and star alliance relationship and the bankruptcy court approved these amendments 

mileage plus mileage plus builds customer loyalty by offering awards and services to frequent travelers mileage plus members can earn mileage credit for flights on united united express ted members of the star alliance and certain other airlines that participate in the program miles also can be earned by purchasing the goods and services of our nonairline partners such as hotels car rental companies and credit card issuers mileage credits can be redeemed for free discounted or upgraded travel and nontravel awards there are more than 52 million members enrolled in mileage plus in 2007 22 million mileage plus travel awards were used on united as compared to 23 million in 2006 and 22 million in 2005 these amounts represent the number of awards for which travel was provided and not the number of available seats that were allocated to award travel these awards represented 80 of uniteds total revenue passenger miles in 2007 81 in 2006 and 74 in 2005 in addition mileage plus members redeemed miles for 928000 nonunited awards in 2007 as compared to 610000 in 2006 nonunited awards include awards such as red carpet club memberships car and hotel awards merchandise and travel solely on another air carrier total miles redeemed for travel on united in 2007 including travel awards and classofservice upgrades represented 88 of the total miles redeemed for both completed and future travel 

for a detailed description of the accounting treatment of mileage plus program activity which was changed to a deferred revenue model upon the adoption of freshstart reporting on the effective date see critical accounting policies in item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  

ual loyalty services llc uls uls focuses on expanding the noncore marketing businesses of united and building airline customer loyalty uls operates substantially all unitedbranded travel distribution and customer loyalty ecommerce activities such as unitedcom in addition uls owns and operates mileage plus being responsible for member relationships communications and account management while united is responsible for other aspects of mileage plus including elite membership programs such as global services premier premier executive and premier executive 1k and the establishment of award mileage redemption programs and airlinerelated customer loyalty recognition policies united is also responsible for managing relationships with its mileage plus airline partners while uls manages relationships with nonairline business partners such as the mileage plus visa card hotels car rental companies and dining programs among others 

distribution channels the majority of uniteds airline seat inventory continues to be distributed through the traditional channels of travel agencies and gds such as sabre and galileo the growing use of alternative distribution systems including wwwunitedcom and gds new entrants however provides united with an opportunity to lower its ticket distribution costs to encourage customer use of 

lowercost channels and capitalize on these costsaving opportunities the company will continue to expand the capabilities of its website 

industry conditions 

seasonality the air travel business is subject to seasonal fluctuations the companys operations can be adversely impacted by severe weather and the first and fourth quarter results of operations normally reflect lower travel demand historically results of operations are better in the second and third quarters which reflect higher levels of travel demand 

domestic competition the domestic airline industry is highly competitive and dynamic in domestic markets new and existing carriers are generally free to initiate service between any two points within the us uniteds competitors consist primarily of other airlines a number of whom are lowcost carriers lccs with cost structures lower than uniteds and to a lesser extent other forms of transportation 

the rate of capacity increases in the domestic market has slowed in the past several years but lccs have continued expanding into markets where united flies united has extensive experience competing directly with lccs in its markets and believes it is well positioned to compete effectively 

domestic pricing decisions are largely affected by the need to be competitive with other us airlines fare discounting by competitors has historically had a negative effect on the companys financial results because united often finds it necessary to match competitors fares to maintain passenger traffic attempts by united and other network airlines to raise fares often fail due to lack of competitive matching by lccs however because of capacity constraint and the pressure of higher fuel prices and other industry conditions some fare increases have occurred because of different cost structures low ticket prices that may generate a profit for a lcc may have an adverse effect on the companys financial results also additional revenue from fuelrelated fare increases may not completely offset the companys increased cost of fuel 

international competition in uniteds international networks the company competes not only with us airlines but also with foreign carriers competition on specified international routes is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulations recently the us and european union eu reached an agreement to reduce restrictions on flight operations between the two entities this agreement is expected to increase competition on uniteds transatlantic network from both us and european airlines in our pacific operations competition will be increasing as the governments of the us and china permit more us and chinese airlines to fly new routes between the two countries see industry regulation below part of uniteds ability to successfully compete with nonus carriers on international routes is its ability to generate traffic from and to the entire us via its integrated domestic route network foreign carriers are currently prohibited by us law from carrying local passengers between two points in the us and united experiences comparable restrictions in many foreign countries in addition us carriers are often constrained from carrying passengers to points beyond designated international gateway cities due to limitations in air service agreements or restrictions imposed unilaterally by foreign governments to compensate for these structural limitations us and foreign carriers have entered into alliances and marketing arrangements that allow these carriers to feed traffic to each others flights see alliances above for further details 

insurance united carries hull and liability insurance of a type customary in the air transportation industry in amounts that the company deems appropriate covering passenger liability public liability and damage to uniteds aircraft and other physical property united also maintains other types of insurance such as property directors and officers cargo automobile and the like with limits and deductibles that are standard within the industry since the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks the companys insurance premiums have increased significantly additionally after september 11 2001 

commercial insurers canceled uniteds liability insurance for losses resulting from war and associated perils terrorism sabotage hijacking and other similar events the us government subsequently agreed to provide commercial warrisk insurance for us based airlines until august 31 2008 covering losses to employees passengers third parties and aircraft the secretary of transportation may extend this coverage until december 31 2008 if the us government does not extend this coverage beyond august 31 2008 obtaining comparable coverage from commercial underwriters could result in substantially higher premiums and more restrictive terms if it is available at all see increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage may adversely impact the companys operations and financial results in item 1a risk factors  below 

industry regulation 

domestic regulation 

general all carriers engaged in air transportation in the united states are subject to regulation by the dot among its responsibilities the dot issues certificates of public convenience and necessity for domestic air transportation no air carrier unless exempted may provide air transportation without a dot certificate of public convenience and necessity grants international route authorities approves international code share agreements regulates methods of competition and enforces certain consumer protection regulations such as those dealing with advertising denied boarding compensation and baggage liability 

airlines also are regulated by the federal aviation administration faa a division of the dot primarily in the areas of flight operations maintenance and other safety and technical matters the faa has authority to issue air carrier operating certificates and aircraft airworthiness certificates prescribe maintenance procedures and regulate pilot and other employee training among other responsibilities from time to time the faa issues rules that require air carriers to take certain actions such as the inspection or modification of aircraft and other equipment that may cause the company to incur substantial unplanned expenses the airline industry is also subject to various other federal state and local laws and regulations the us department of homeland security dhs has jurisdiction over virtually all aspects of civil aviation security see  legislation  below the us department of justice doj has jurisdiction over certain airline competition matters the us postal service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail labor relations in the airline industry are generally governed by the railway labor act rla the company is also subject to inquiries by the dot faa and other us and international regulatory bodies 

airport access access to landing and takeoff rights or slots at several major us airports and many foreign airports served by united are or recently have been subject to government regulation the faa designated ronald reagan washington national airport in washington dc as a high density rule traffic airport and has limited the number of departure and arrival slots at the airport slot restrictions at ohare were eliminated in july 2002 and were eliminated at john f kennedy international airport jfk and laguardia airport laguardia both in new york in january 2007 from time to time the elimination of slot restrictions has impacted uniteds operational performance and reliability 

notwithstanding the formal elimination of slot restrictions at ohare in july 2002 the faa imposed temporary restrictions on flight operations there beginning in 2004 to address air traffic congestion concerns in august 2006 the faa issued a longerterm rule restricting flight operations at ohare which remains in effect through october 2008 

at laguardia the faa has proposed an interim rule that would impose caps and restrictions on flight operations similar to those in effect at ohare the interim rule took effect in january 2007 when the high density rule expired the faa has also proposed a longerterm rule at laguardia that is designed to control air traffic congestion there indefinitely the longerterm proposal contains several 

elements that could impact uniteds schedule and operational performance at laguardia it is not possible to predict whether or when such longerterm rules might take effect 

in addition in reaction to substantial flight delays and congestion in the new york city region during the summer months of 2007 and an increase in scheduled flights for summer 2008 the faa announced plans to impose capacity limits at jfk and newark airports beginning in the summer season 2008 and which would remain in effect through the summer season 2009 in addition the dot has indicated an intention to propose additional new regulations for managing airport congestion however it is difficult at this time to predict the impact of any new legislation on the companys operations 

legislation the airline industry is also subject to legislative activity that can have an impact on operations and costs specifically the law that authorizes federal excise taxes and fees assessed on airline tickets expired in september 2007 and is currently extended until february 29 2008 in late february 2008 congress sent legislation to the president that would extend these federal excise taxes and fees until june 30 2008 congress is currently attempting to pass comprehensive reauthorization legislation to impose a new funding structure and make other changes to faa operations past aviation reauthorization bills have affected a wide range of areas of interest to the industry including air traffic control operations capacity control issues airline competition issues aircraft and airport technology requirements safety issues taxes fees and other funding sources 

customer service issues have been a significant focus of both congress and dot regulators during 2007 it is likely that legislation imposing more specific customer service requirements will be approved by congress in 2008 though what those requirements might be is unclear at this time the dot has also initiated processes to consider regulatory changes in this area including proposals regarding treatment of and payments to passengers involuntarily denied boarding and proposals regarding delay reporting requirements and airline scheduling practices 

on january 1 2008 the state of new york implemented legislation requiring air carriers operating within the state to offer certain enumerated services to passengers experiencing extended onboard ground delays of greater than three hours the new york law authorizes the state consumer protection board to impose civil penalties for noncompliance although the air transport association has filed a lawsuit challenging the new york statute on the grounds that federal law prohibits state regulation of airline services several other states are considering similar legislation the new york legislation and any other similar legislation if adopted in other states could have an impact on the companys results of operations or financial condition 

additionally since september 11 2001 aviation security has been and continues to be a subject of frequent legislative and regulatory action requiring changes to our security processes and increasing the cost of security procedures for the company the aviation and transportation security act the aviation security act enacted in november 2001 has had wideranging effects on our operations the aviation security act made the federal government responsible for virtually all aspects of civil aviation security creating a new transportation security administration tsa which is a part of the dhs pursuant to the homeland security act of 2002 under the aviation security act substantially all security screeners at airports are now federal employees and significant other aspects of airline and airport security are now overseen by the tsa pursuant to the aviation security act funding for airline and airport security is provided in part by a passenger security fee of 250 per flight segment capped at 1000 per round trip which is collected by the air carriers from passengers and remitted to the government in addition air carriers are required to submit to the government an additional security fee equal to the amount each air carrier paid for security screening of passengers and property in 2000 a dhsus customs and border protection cbp regulation effective in early 2008 will give cbp a greater role in airline customer processing and potentially a greater operational role as cbp will forbid boarding international passengers until it has cleared passenger names against watch lists a proposed tsa regulation regarding domestic passengers secure flight currently in the rulemaking 

process is likely to expand tsas role in similar ways when that rule becomes effective congress is expected to continue to focus on changes to aviation security law and requirements in 2008 particular areas of attention that could result in increased costs for air carriers will likely include new requirements on cargo screening possible deployment of antimissile technology on passenger aircraft and potential for increased passenger and carrier security fees 

international regulation 

general international air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation in connection with uniteds international services the company is regulated by both the us government and the governments of the foreign countries united serves in addition the availability of international routes to us carriers is regulated by treaties and related aviation agreements between the us and foreign governments and in some cases fares and schedules require the approval of the dot andor the relevant foreign governments 

airport access historically access to foreign markets has been tightly controlled through bilateral agreements between the us and each foreign country involved these agreements regulate the number of markets served the number of carriers allowed to serve each market and the frequency of carriers flights since the early 1990s the us has pursued a policy of open skies meaning all carriers have access to the destination under which the us government has negotiated a number of bilateral agreements allowing unrestricted access to foreign markets additionally all of the airports that united serves in europe and asia maintain slot controls and many of these are restrictive due to congestion at these airports london heathrow frankfurt and tokyo narita are among the most restrictive due to capacity limitations and united has significant operations at these locations 

further uniteds ability to serve some countries and expand into certain others is limited by the absence altogether of aviation agreements between the us government and the relevant governments shifts in us or foreign government aviation policies can lead to the alteration or termination of air service agreements between the us and other countries depending on the nature of the change the value of uniteds international route authorities and slot rights may be materially enhanced or diminished 

on april 30 2007 the us and the eu signed a transatlantic aviation agreement to replace the existing bilateral arrangements between the us government and the 27 eu member states the agreement is expected to become effective at the end of march 2008 

the agreement is based on the us open skies model and authorizes us airlines to operate between the united states and any point in the eu and beyond free from government restrictions on capacity frequencies and scheduling and provides eu carriers with reciprocal rights in these useu markets the agreement also authorizes all us and eu carriers to operate services between the united states and london heathrow thereby potentially adding new competition to uniteds heathrow operation although heathrow is currently subject to both slot and facility constraints which may practically limit the growth of new competition in the near term this agreement does not provide for a reallocation of existing slots among carriers 

under the agreements community carrier clause an eu carrier may operate services to the united states from any point in the eu and not simply from its home market a number of eu carriers have indicated that they will commence services from outside their home markets to the us when the agreement becomes effective thereby potentially increasing competition in many transatlantic markets 

the agreement would confer a number of additional rights to eu carriers that are designed to redress what the eu considers to be an imbalance between us carrier access to the intraeu market versus eu carrier access to the us domestic market in particular eu ownership of more than 

50 percent of a us carrier will not be presumed to violate the actual control by us citizens requirement provided foreign ownership of the voting equity of the us carrier does not exceed the statutory limit of 25 percent us ownership of eu carriers may not exceed 499 percent and the eu may enact future legislation restricting us ownership of the voting stock of eu airlines to 25 percent the agreement also provides eu passenger carriers with the right to operate between the us and a limited number of noneu countries and does not provide reciprocal rights to us carriers 

the euus open skies agreement will likely directly impact the future value and expected lives of route authorities to heathrow however there is no direct impact from the open skies agreement on airport slot rights including those at heathrow the open skies agreement is also expected to provide united and other carriers with access to new markets in eu countries in september 2007 the dot granted united antitrust immunity with bmi the immunity goes into effect at the same time as the open skies agreement between the us and eu at the end of march 2008 because of the diverse nature of potential impacts on uniteds business from the eu transatlantic aviation agreement the overall future impact of the agreement on uniteds business in the eu region cannot be predicted with certainty 

the european commission the commission is expected to propose important new legislation or to adopt interpretive guidance that will impact the company the commission recently proposed legislation that would significantly deregulate the current computer reservation system crs code of conduct if adopted this legislation may lead to lower airline distribution costs in europe the commission may also take steps to officially sanction secondary slot trading which is a current practice among carriers that involves the sale purchase or lease of slots if adopted that legislation or interpretive guidance should resolve disputes about the legality of slot exchanges at eu airports and permit carriers to continue with this longstanding practice in addition legislation to include aviation within the eus existing emissions trading scheme is currently being considered within the eu legislative process if adopted such a measure could add significantly to the costs of airlines operating in the eu member states the precise cost to united will depend upon the terms of the legislation enacted which would determine whether united will be forced to buy emission allowances and the cost at which these allowances may be obtained 

pursuant to an agreement reached in december 2005 a full open skies agreement between the united states and canada came into force in 2007 the dot also approved the 9party antitrust immunity application including united air canada lufthansa sas austrian swiss lot tap and bmi allowing united and air canada to expand their existing antitrust immunity beyond the currently allowed transborder region 

environmental regulation 

the airline industry is subject to increasingly stringent federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning emissions to the air discharges to surface and subsurface waters safe drinking water and the management of hazardous substances oils and waste materials new regulations surrounding the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide are being considered for promulgation both internationally and within the united states united is carefully evaluating the potential impact of such proposed regulations other areas of developing regulations include the state of california rulemakings regarding air emissions from ground support equipment and a federal rulemaking concerning the discharge of deicing fluid the airline industry is also subject to other environmental laws and regulations including those that require the company to remediate soil or groundwater to meet certain objectives compliance with all environmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures under the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund and similar environmental cleanup laws generators of waste materials and owners or operators of facilities can be subject to liability for investigation and remediation costs at locations that have been identified as requiring response actions 

the company also conducts voluntary environmental assessment and remediation actions environmental cleanup obligations can arise from among other circumstances the operation of aircraft fueling facilities and primarily involve airport sites future costs associated with these activities are currently not expected to have a material adverse affect on the companys business 

employees 

as of december 31 2007 the company and its subsidiaries had approximately 55000 active employees of whom approximately 81 were represented by various us labor organizations the employee groups number of employees and labor organization for each of uniteds collective bargaining groups were as follows 

 1 international association of machinists and aerospace workers iam association of flight attendants—communication workers of america afa air line pilots association alpa aircraft mechanics fraternal association amfa international federation of professional and technical engineers ifpte and professional airline flight control association pafca collective bargaining agreements cbas are negotiated under the rla which governs labor relations in the air transportation industry and such agreements typically do not contain an expiration date instead they specify an amendable date upon which the contract is considered open for amendment before the amendable date neither party is required to agree to modifications to the bargaining agreement nevertheless nothing prevents the parties from agreeing to start negotiations or to modify the agreement in advance of the amendable date contracts remain in effect while new agreements are negotiated during the negotiating period both the company and the negotiating union are required to maintain the status quo 

on december 4 2007 the international brotherhood of teamsters teamsters filed an application with the national mediation board nmb seeking the right to represent uniteds mechanics and related employees who are currently represented by amfa on january 24 2008 the nmb found that the teamsters had submitted sufficient valid signed authorization cards from a majority of the eligible employees and ordered that a representation election be conducted voting will take place from february 26 2008 through march 31 2008 amfa and teamsters will appear on the ballot writein votes are permitted if a majority of eligible employees active and furloughed vote in favor of union representation the union receiving a majority of the votes would be declared the representative if a majority of the employees vote for representation but no single organization receives a majority of the votes cast there would be a runoff election between the two organizations receiving the most votes if less than a majority of eligible employees cast ballots in the initial election the employees will become unrepresented 

item 1a risk factors 

  the following risk factors should be read carefully when evaluating the companys business and the forwardlooking statements contained in this report and other statements the company or its representatives make from time to time any of the following risks could materially adversely affect the companys business operating results financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forwardlooking statements are made in this report 

risks related to the companys business 

continued periods of historically high fuel costs or significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a material adverse impact on the companys operating results 

the companys operating results have been and continue to be significantly impacted by changes in the supply or price of aircraft fuel it is impossible to predict the future supply or price of aircraft fuel the recordhigh fuel prices in 2005 and 2006 increased further in 2007 to new record highs with the price of crude oil reaching nearly 100 per barrel at times united has not been able to increase its fares when fuel prices have risen due to the highly competitive nature of the airline industry and it may not be able to do so in the future in addition fare increases may not totally offset the fuel price increase and may also reduce demand for air travel from time to time the company enters into hedging arrangements to protect against rising fuel costs the companys hedging programs may not be successful in controlling fuel costs and may be limited due to market conditions and other factors 

additional terrorist attacks or the fear of such attacks even if not made directly on the airline industry could negatively affect the company and the airline industry 

the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 involving commercial aircraft severely and adversely affected the companys financial condition and results of operations as well as prospects for the airline industry generally among the effects experienced from the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks were substantial flight disruption costs caused by the faaimposed temporary grounding of the us airline industrys fleet significantly increased security costs and associated passenger inconvenience increased insurance costs substantially higher ticket refunds and significantly decreased traffic and revenue per revenue passenger mile yield 

additional terrorist attacks even if not made directly on the airline industry or the fear of or the precautions taken in anticipation of such attacks including elevated national threat warnings or selective cancellation or redirection of flights could materially and adversely affect the company and the airline industry the war in iraq and additional international hostilities including heightened terrorist activity could also have a material adverse impact on the companys financial condition liquidity and results of operations the companys financial resources might not be sufficient to absorb the adverse effects of any further terrorist attacks or an increase in postwar unrest in iraq or other international hostilities involving the united states or us interests 

the airline industry is highly competitive susceptible to price discounting and may undergo consolidation 

the us airline industry is characterized by substantial price competition especially in domestic markets some of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources or lowercost structures than united does or both in recent years the market share held by lccs has increased significantly large network carriers like united have often had a lack of pricing power within domestic markets 

in addition northwest airlines inc and delta air lines inc completed their reorganizations under bankruptcy protection in 2007 other carriers could file for bankruptcy or threaten to do so to reduce their costs carriers operating under bankruptcy protection can operate in a manner that could be adverse to the company and could emerge from bankruptcy as more vigorous competitors 

from time to time the us airline industry has undergone consolidation as in the merger of us airways and america west and may experience additional consolidation in the future united routinely monitors changes in the competitive landscape and engages in analysis and discussions regarding its strategic position including alliances asset acquisitions and business combinations there is ongoing speculation that some type of airline industry consolidation could occur in the nearterm the company has had and expects to continue to have discussions with other airlines regarding strategic alternatives if other airlines participate in merger activity and united does not those airlines may significantly improve their cost structures or revenue generation capabilities thereby potentially making them stronger competitors of united 

additional security requirements may increase the companys costs and decrease its revenues and traffic 

since september 11 2001 the dhs and the tsa have implemented numerous security measures that affect airline operations and costs and are likely to implement additional measures in the future in addition foreign governments have also instituted additional security measures at foreign airports united serves a substantial portion of the costs of these security measures is borne by the airlines and their passengers increasing the companys costs andor reducing its revenue and traffic additional measures taken to enhance either passenger or cargo security procedures andor to recover associated costs in the future may result in similar adverse effects on uniteds results of operations 

extensive government regulation could increase the companys operating costs and restrict its ability to conduct its business 

airlines are subject to extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirements that result in significant costs in addition to the enactment of the aviation security act laws regulations taxes and airport rates and charges have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce airline revenue the faa from time to time also issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require significant expenditures by united the company expects to continue incurring material expenses to comply with the regulations of the faa and other agencies 

united operates under a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the dot if the dot altered amended modified suspended or revoked our certificate it could have a material adverse effect on the companys business the faa can also limit uniteds airport access by limiting the number of departure and arrival slots at high density traffic airports and local airport authorities may have the ability to control access to certain facilities or the cost of access to such facilities which could have an adverse effect on the companys business 

in addition access to landing and takeoff rights or slots at several major us airports and many foreign airports served by united are or recently have been subject to government regulation as passenger travel has continued to increase in recent years many us and foreign airports have become increasingly congested certain of uniteds major hubs are among the more congested airports in the us and have been or could be the subject of regulatory action that might limit the number of flights andor increase costs of operations at certain times or throughout the day 

in addition the companys operations may be adversely impacted due to the existing outdated air traffic control atc system utilized by the us government during peak travel periods in certain markets the current atc systems inability to handle existing travel demand has led to shortterm capacity constraints imposed by government agencies as discussed above and has also resulted in delays and disruptions of traffic using the atc system in addition the current system will not be able to effectively handle projected future air traffic growth therefore imposition of these air traffic constraints on a longterm basis may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations failure to update the atc system in a timely manner and the substantial funding requirements of a 

modernized atc system that may be imposed on carriers like united may have an adverse impact on the companys financial condition or results of operations 

many aspects of uniteds operations are also subject to increasingly stringent federal state and local laws protecting the environment future regulatory developments in the us and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in the airline industry for example potential future actions that may be taken by the us government state governments within the us foreign governments or the international civil aviation organization to limit the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry are uncertain at this time but the impact to the company and its industry would likely be adverse and could be significant including the potential for increased fuel costs carbon taxes or fees or a requirement to purchase carbon credits 

the ability of us carriers to operate international routes is subject to change because the applicable arrangements between the united states and foreign governments may be amended from time to time or because appropriate slots or facilities may not be made available united currently operates on a number of international routes under government arrangements that limit the number of carriers capacity or the number of carriers allowed access to particular airports if an open skies policy were to be adopted for any of these routes such an event could have a material adverse impact on the companys financial position and results of operations and could result in the impairment of material amounts of related intangible assets recently the us and the eu entered into an open skies agreement that will become effective at the end of march 2008 see note 8 intangibles in the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the open skies agreement 

further the companys operations in foreign countries are subject to various laws and regulations in those countries the company cannot provide any assurance that current laws and regulations or laws or regulations enacted in the future will not adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations 

the companys results of operations fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors associated with the airline industry 

due to greater demand for air travel during the summer months revenues in the airline industry in the second and third quarters of the year are generally stronger than revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year the companys results of operations generally reflect this seasonality but have also been impacted by numerous other factors that are not necessarily seasonal including among others the imposition of excise and similar taxes extreme or severe weather air traffic control congestion changes in the competitive environment due to industry consolidation and other factors and general economic conditions as a result the companys quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year and historical operating results in a quarterly or annual period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results 

the companys financial condition and results of operations may be further affected by the future resolution of bankruptcyrelated contingencies 

despite the companys exit from bankruptcy on february 1 2006 several significant matters remain to be resolved in connection with its reorganization under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code unfavorable resolution of these matters could have a material adverse effect on the companys business for additional detail regarding these matters see note 1 voluntary reorganization under chapter 11—significant matters remaining to be resolved in chapter 11 cases in the combined notes to consolidated financial statements  

the companys initiatives to improve the delivery of its products and services to its customers reduce costs increase its revenues and increase shareholder value may not be adequate or successful 

the company continues to identify and implement continuous improvement programs to improve the delivery of its products and services to its customers reduce its costs and increase its revenues some of these efforts are focused on cost savings in such areas as telecommunications airport services catering maintenance materials aircraft ground handling and regional affiliates expenses among others the company is also reviewing strategic alternatives to maximize the value of its mro and mileage plus businesses which may include a possible sale of all or part of these operations a number of the companys ongoing initiatives involve significant changes to the companys business that it may be unable to implement successfully in addition revenue and other initiatives may not be successful due to the competitive landscape of the industry and the reaction of our competitors to certain of our initiatives the adequacy and ultimate success of the companys programs and initiatives to improve the delivery of its products and services to its customers reduce its costs and increase both its revenues and shareholder value cannot be assured there can be no assurance that any transactions with respect to the companys mro and mileage plus business will occur nor are there any assurances with respect to the form or timing of any such transactions or their actual effect on shareholder value 

union disputes employee strikes and other laborrelated disruptions may adversely affect the companys operations and impair its financial performance 

approximately 81 of the employees of ual are represented for collective bargaining purposes by us labor unions these employees are organized into six labor groups represented by six different unions 

relations between air carriers and labor unions in the united states are governed by the rla under the rla a carrier must maintain the existing terms and conditions of employment following the amendable date through a multistage and usually lengthy series of bargaining processes overseen by the nmb this process continues until either the parties have reached agreement on a new cba or the parties are released to selfhelp by the nmb although in most circumstances the rla prohibits strikes shortly after release by the nmb carriers and unions are free to engage in selfhelp measures such as strikes and lockouts all six of the companys us labor agreements become amendable in january 2010 there is also a risk that dissatisfied employees either with or without union involvement could engage in illegal slowdowns work stoppages partial work stoppages sickouts or other actions short of a full strike that could individually or collectively harm the operation of the airline and materially impair its financial performance 

increases in insurance costs or reductions in insurance coverage may adversely impact the companys operations and financial results 

the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 led to a significant increase in insurance premiums and a decrease in the insurance coverage available to commercial airlines accordingly the companys insurance costs increased significantly and its ability to continue to obtain certain types of insurance remains uncertain the company has obtained thirdparty war risk terrorism insurance through a special program administered by the faa resulting in lower premiums than if it had obtained this insurance in the commercial insurance market should the government discontinue this coverage obtaining comparable coverage from commercial underwriters could result in substantially higher premiums and more restrictive terms if it is available at all if the company is unable to obtain adequate war risk insurance its business could be materially and adversely affected 

if any of uniteds aircraft were to be involved in an accident the company could be exposed to significant liability the insurance it carries to cover damages arising from any future accidents may be 

inadequate if the companys insurance is not adequate it may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident 

the company relies heavily on automated systems to operate its business and any significant failure of these systems could harm its business 

the company depends on automated systems to operate its business including its computerized airline reservation systems flight operations systems telecommunication systems and commercial websites including unitedcom uniteds website and reservation systems must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic and deliver important flight and schedule information as well as process critical financial transactions substantial or repeated website reservations systems or telecommunication systems failures could reduce the attractiveness of uniteds services versus its competitors and materially impair its ability to market its services and operate its flights 

the companys business relies extensively on thirdparty providers failure of these parties to perform as expected or unexpected interruptions in the companys relationships with these providers or their provision of services to the company could have an adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations 

the company has engaged a growing number of thirdparty service providers to perform a large number of functions that are integral to its business such as operation of united express flights operation of customer service call centers provision of information technology infrastructure and services provision of aircraft maintenance and repairs provision of various utilities and performance of aircraft fueling operations among other vital functions and services the company does not directly control these thirdparty providers although it does enter into agreements with many of them that define expected service performance any of these thirdparty providers however may materially fail to meet their service performance commitments to the company the failure of these providers to adequately perform their service obligations or other unexpected interruptions of services may reduce the companys revenues and increase its expenses or prevent united from operating its flights and providing other services to its customers in addition the companys business and financial performance could be materially harmed if its customers believe that its services are unreliable or unsatisfactory 

the companys high level of fixed obligations could limit its ability to fund general corporate requirements and obtain additional financing could limit its flexibility in responding to competitive developments and could increase its vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions 

the company has a significant amount of financial leverage from fixed obligations including its amended credit facility aircraft lease and debt financings leases of airport property and other facilities and other material cash obligations in addition as of december 31 2007 the company had pledged a substantial majority of its available assets as collateral to secure its various fixed obligations at december 31 2007 the company has 113 unencumbered aircraft with a net book value of 20 billion 

the companys high level of fixed obligations a downgrade in the companys credit ratings or poor credit market conditions could impair its ability to obtain additional financing if needed and reduce its flexibility to conduct its business certain of the companys existing indebtedness also requires it to meet covenants and financial tests to maintain ongoing access to those borrowings see note 12 debt obligations in the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further details a failure to timely pay its debts or other material uncured breach of its contractual obligations could result in a variety of adverse consequences including the acceleration of the companys indebtedness the withholding of credit card sale proceeds by its credit card service providers and the exercise of other remedies by its creditors and equipment lessors that could result in material adverse effects on the companys operations and financial condition in such a situation it is unlikely that the 

company would be able to fulfill its obligations to repay the accelerated indebtedness make required lease payments or otherwise cover its fixed costs 

the companys net operating loss carry forward may be limited or possibly eliminated 

the company has a net operating loss nol carry forward tax benefit of approximately 25 billion for federal and state income tax purposes that primarily originated before uals emergence from bankruptcy and will expire over a five to twenty year period this tax benefit is mostly attributable to federal pretax nol carry forwards of 66 billion if the company were to have a change of ownership within the meaning of section 382 of the internal revenue code under certain conditions its annual federal nol utilization could be limited to an amount equal to its market capitalization at the time of the ownership change multiplied by the federal longterm tax exempt rate a change of ownership under section 382 of the internal revenue code is defined as a cumulative change of 50 percentage points or more in the ownership positions of certain stockholders owning 5 or more of the companys common stock over a three year rolling period 

to reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect on the companys ability to utilize its nol carry forward for federal income tax purposes uals restated certificate of incorporation contains a 5 ownership limitation applicable to all stockholders except the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc the 5 ownership limitation remains effective until february 1 2011 the 5 ownership limitation prohibits i the acquisition by a single stockholder of shares representing 5 or more of the common stock of ual corporation and ii any acquisition or disposition of common stock by a stockholder that already owns 5 or more of ual corporations common stock unless prior written approval is granted by the ual board of directors the percentage ownership of a single stockholder can be computed by dividing the number of shares of common stock held by the stockholder by the sum of the shares of common stock issued and outstanding plus the number of shares of common stock still held in reserve for payment to unsecured creditors under the plan of reorganization for additional information regarding the 5 ownership limitation please refer to uals restated certificate available on its website 

while the purpose of these transfer restrictions is to prevent a change of ownership from occurring within the meaning of section 382 of the internal revenue code which ownership change might materially and adversely affect the companys ability to utilize its nol carry forward or other tax attributes no assurance can be given that such an ownership change will not occur in which case the availability of the companys substantial nol carry forward and other federal income tax attributes might be significantly limited or possibly eliminated 

the company is subject to economic and political instability and other risks of doing business globally 

the company is a global business with operations outside of the united states from which it derives approximately onethird of its operating revenues as measured and reported to the dot the companys operations in asia latin america the middle east and europe are a vital part of its worldwide airline network volatile economic political and market conditions in these international regions may have a negative impact on the companys operating results and its ability to achieve its business objectives in addition significant or volatile changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies and the imposition of exchange controls or other currency restrictions may have a material adverse impact upon the companys liquidity revenues costs or operating results 

the loss of skilled employees upon whom the company depends to operate its business or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel could adversely affect its results of operations 

the company believes that its future success will depend in large part on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified management operational technical and other personnel the company may not be successful in retaining key personnel or in attracting and retaining other highly qualified personnel 

any inability to retain or attract significant numbers of qualified management and other personnel could adversely affect its business 

the company could be adversely affected by an outbreak of a disease that affects travel behavior 

an outbreak of a disease that affects travel demand or travel behavior such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars or avian flu or other illness could have a material adverse impact on the companys business financial condition and results of operations 

certain provisions of uals governance documents could discourage or delay changes of control or changes to the board of directors of ual 

certain provisions of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws of ual the governance documents may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of uals board of directors and may discourage takeover attempts that some of its stockholders may consider beneficial 

certain provisions of the governance documents may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if uals board of directors determines that such changes in control are not in the best interests of ual and its stockholders 

these provisions of the governance documents are not intended to prevent a takeover but are intended to protect and maximize the value of uals stockholders interests while these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of ual to negotiate with the ual board of directors they could enable the board of directors to prevent a transaction that some or a majority of its stockholders might believe to be in their best interests and in that case may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

the issuance of uals contingent senior unsecured notes could adversely impact results of operations liquidity and financial position and could cause dilution to the interests of its existing stockholders 

in connection with the companys emergence from chapter 11 bankruptcy protection ual is obligated under an indenture to issue to the pbgc 8 senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principal amount of up to 500 million in up to eight equal tranches of 625 million with no more than one tranche issued as a result of each issuance trigger event upon the occurrence of certain financial triggering events an issuance trigger event occurs when the companys ebitdar as defined in the indenture exceeds 35 billion over the prior twelve months ending june 30 or december 31 of any applicable fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ending december 31 2009 and ending with the fiscal year ending december 31 2017 however if the issuance of a tranche would cause a default under any other securities then existing ual may satisfy its obligations with respect to such tranche by issuing ual common stock having a market value equal to 625 million the issuance of these notes could adversely impact the companys results of operations because of increased interest expense related to the notes and adversely impact its financial position or liquidity due to increased cash required to meet interest and principal payments if common stock is issued in lieu of debt this could cause additional dilution to existing ual stockholders see risks related to uals common stock below for additional information regarding other risks related to our common stock 

risks related to uals common stock 

uals common stock has a limited trading history and its market price may be volatile 

because uals common stock began trading on the nasdaq national market on february 2 2006 there is limited trading history the market price of its common stock may fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors many of which are beyond uals control 

the issuance of additional shares of uals common stock including upon conversion of its convertible preferred stock and its convertible notes could cause dilution to the interests of its existing stockholders 

in connection with the companys emergence from chapter 11 bankruptcy protection ual issued 5000000 shares of 2 convertible preferred stock effective february 1 2008 this preferred stock may be converted into shares of uals common stock further the preferred stock is mandatorily convertible 15 years from the issuance date ual also issued approximately 150 million in convertible 5 notes shortly after the effective date and subsequently issued approximately 726 million in convertible 45 notes on july 25 2006 holders of these securities may convert them into shares of uals common stock according to their terms in february 2008 10 million shares of 2 convertible preferred stock were converted into approximately 22 million shares of ual common stock resulting in dilution to common stockholders if the holders of the remaining 40 million shares of convertible preferred stock or the holders of the convertible notes were to exercise their rights to convert their securities into common stock it could cause substantial dilution to existing stockholders in january 2008 as a result of uals 215 per common share special distribution ual modified the conversion prices of the 5 and 45 notes in accordance with the terms of their indentures the lower conversion prices increase the potential dilution to existing ual stockholders ual may undertake future actions that may result in additional modifications to the conversion prices of these instruments and increase their likelihood of conversion for further information see note 12 debt obligations and note 13 ual preferred stock in the combined notes to consolidated financial statements  

uals certificate of incorporation authorizes up to one billion shares of common stock in certain circumstances ual can issue shares of common stock without stockholder approval in addition the board of directors is authorized to issue up to 250 million shares of preferred stock without any action on the part of uals stockholders the ual board of directors also has the power without stockholder approval to set the terms of any series of shares of preferred stock that may be issued including voting rights conversion rights dividend rights preferences over uals common stock with respect to dividends or if ual liquidates dissolves or winds up its business and other terms if ual issues preferred stock in the future that has a preference over its common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon its liquidation dissolution or winding up or if ual issues preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of its common stock the rights of holders of its common stock or the market price of its common stock could be adversely affected ual is also authorized to issue without stockholder approval other securities convertible into either preferred stock or in certain circumstances common stock in the future ual may decide to raise capital through offerings of its common stock securities convertible into its common stock or rights to acquire these securities or its common stock the issuance of additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into common stock could result in dilution of existing stockholders equity interests in ual issuances of substantial amounts of its common stock or the perception that such issuances could occur may adversely affect prevailing market prices for uals common stock and ual cannot predict the effect this dilution may have on the price of its common stock 

uals certificate of incorporation limits voting rights of certain foreign persons 

uals restated certificate of incorporation limits the voting rights of persons holding any of uals equity securities who are not citizens of the united states as defined in section 40102a15 of title 49 united states code to 249 of the aggregate votes of all equity securities outstanding this restriction is applied pro rata among all holders of equity securities who fail to qualify as citizens of the united states based on the number of votes the underlying securities are entitled to

air cargopassenger surcharge investigations 

in february 2006 the european commission the commission and the doj commenced an international investigation into what government officials describe as a possible price fixing conspiracy relating to certain surcharges included in tariffs for carrying air cargo in june 2006 united received a subpoena from the doj requesting information related to certain passenger pricing practices and surcharges applicable to international passenger routes we are cooperating fully united is considered a source of information for the doj investigation not a target 

separately united received information requests regarding cargo pricing matters from the competition authorities in brazil the european union and australia on december 18 2007 the commission issued a statement of objections to 26 air carriers setting out evidence related to the utilization of fuel and security surcharges and exchange of pricing information that the commission views as supporting the conclusion that an illegal pricefixing cartel had been in operation in the air cargo transportation industry united is cooperating with the commissions investigation united intends to defend itself vigorously against these charges in its formal response to the commission and in the european court of justice if necessary 

in addition to the government investigations united and other air cargo carriers were named as defendants in over ninety class action lawsuits alleging civil damages as a result of the purported air cargo pricing conspiracy those lawsuits were consolidated for pretrial activities in the united states federal court for the eastern district of new york united entered into an agreement with the majority of the private plaintiffs to dismiss united from the class action lawsuits in return for an agreement to cooperate with the plaintiffs factual investigation and united is no longer named as a defendant in the consolidated civil lawsuit the company is reviewing whether its receipt of a statement of objections from the eu commission will impact the civil litigation 

multiple putative class actions have also been filed alleging violations of the antitrust laws with respect to passenger pricing practices those lawsuits have been consolidated or are pending consolidation for pretrial activities in the united states federal court for the northern district of california federal court united has entered into a settlement agreement with a number of the plaintiffs in the passenger pricing cases to dismiss united from the class action lawsuits in return for an 

agreement to cooperate with the plaintiffs factual investigation the settlement agreement is subject to review and approval by the federal court 

penalties for violating competition laws can be severe involving both criminal and civil liability we are cooperating with the grand jury investigations while carrying out our own internal review of our pricing practices and are not in a position to predict the potential financial impact of this litigation at this time however a finding that we violated either us antitrust laws or the competition laws of some other jurisdiction could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

litigation associated with september 11 terrorism 

families of 94 victims of the september 11 terrorist attacks filed lawsuits asserting a variety of claims against the airline industry united and american airlines as the two carriers whose flights were hijacked are the central focus of the litigation but a variety of additional parties have been sued on a number of legal theories ranging from collective responsibility for airport screening and security systems that allegedly failed to prevent the attacks to faulty design and construction of the world trade center towers in excess of 97 of the families of the deceased victims received awards from the september 11 th victims compensation fund of 2001 which was established by the federal government and consequently are now barred from making further claims against the airlines world trade center properties inc as lessee has filed claims against the aviation defendants and the port authority of new york and new jersey the owner of the world trade center the port authority has also filed crossclaims against the aviation defendants in both the wrongful death litigation and for property damage sustained in the attacks the insurers of various tenants at the world trade center have filed subrogation claims for damages as well in the aggregate september 11 th claims are estimated to be well in excess of 10 billion by statute these matters were consolidated in the us district court for the southern district of new york and airline exposure was capped at the limit of the liability coverage maintained by each carrier at the time of the attacks in the personal injury and wrongful death matters settlement discussions continue and the parties have reached settlement agreements for the majority of the remaining claims the company anticipates that any liability it may face arising from the events of september 11 2001 could be significant but by statute will be limited to the amount of its insurance coverage

other legal proceedings 

ual and united are involved in various other claims and legal actions involving passengers customers suppliers employees and government agencies arising in the ordinary course of business additionally from time to time the company becomes aware of potential noncompliance with applicable environmental regulations which have either been identified by the company through internal compliance programs such as its environmental compliance audits or through notice from a governmental entity in some instances these matters could potentially become the subject of an administrative or judicial proceeding and could potentially involve monetary sanctions after considering a number of factors including but not limited to the views of legal counsel the nature of contingencies to which the company is subject and prior experience management believes that the ultimate disposition of these contingencies will not materially affect its consolidated financial position or results of operations

the air travel business is subject to seasonal fluctuations and historically the companys results of operations are better in the second and third quarters as compared to the first and fourth quarters of each year since our first and fourth quarter results normally reflect weaker travel demand the companys results of operations can be impacted by adverse weather air traffic control delays and other factors in any period

• united express contributed 122 million to operating income in 2007 as compared to 77 million in 2006 and 317 million of operating losses in 2005 this improvement is due to an improved regional operations cost structure resulting from the bankruptcy reorganization network optimization similar to that achieved for the mainline operation and the replacement of some 50seat regional jets with larger regional jets that are equipped with explus and offer both first class and economy plus service among other factors • mainline fuel costs have significantly increased since 2005 increasing by 179 million from 2006 to 2007 in addition to the 792 million increase from 2005 to 2006 these increases are primarily due to significant increases in market prices for jet fuel the companys average cost per gallon for jet fuel including taxes and hedge impacts increased from approximately 179 in 2005 to 211 in 2006 and 218 in 2007 similar increases were experienced in united express average cost per gallon of jet fuel which is classified as regional affiliates expense in the statements of consolidated operations  • in 2007 and 2006 the company recorded approximately 119 million and 9 million respectively of employee profit sharing including related employee taxes based on annual pretax earnings the rate of profit sharing was increased from 75 to 15 between periods and pretax income was significantly higher in 2007 a 110 million decrease in sharebased compensation expense offset the increase in the companys profit sharing plan expense • aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs expense increased 157 million or 16 in 2007 as compared to 2006 and by 128 million or 15 in 2006 as compared to 2005 as further discussed in the results of operations section below these increases are due to several factors including higher volumes of heavy maintenance visits increased rates under certain longterm maintenance contracts and a higher cost of parts • interest expense decreased 109 million in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to 22 billion of decreased balance sheet debt outstanding and a credit facility amendment in february 2007 that significantly lowered our interest rate under the credit facility interest expense increased 288 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to increased debt outstanding of approximately 14 billion as a result of the companys new capital structure resulting from its emergence from bankruptcy on february 1 2006 • in 2007 and 2006 ual recognized income tax expense of 297 million and 21 million respectively income taxes were not recorded in the 2005 period the following items describe the significant and largely noncash freshstart reporting impacts effective february 1 2006 that affect the comparison of 2006 to 2005 

• as part of freshstart reporting the company changed its accounting for mileage plus from the incremental cost model to the deferred revenue model this change in accounting negatively impacted the companys operating revenues by approximately 158 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 the negative revenue impact was partially offset by a reduction in operating expense of approximately 27 million which the company estimates would have been recorded if the incremental cost method had been continued mileage plus accounting is discussed further in critical accounting policies below • the company recorded noncash sharebased compensation expense of 159 million in 2006 in association with its sharebased compensation plans this expense was not recognized in 2005 because prior to 2006 the company accounted for its sharebased compensation plans under the intrinsic method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 25  accounting for stock issued to employees  35 

• the company recognized noncash depreciation and amortization charges of 74 million on assets that were recorded at fair value as part of freshstart reporting including definitelived intangible assets that were recognized under freshstart accounting ual did not recognize similar asset values or related amortization expense in the preceding annual periods • the adjustment of the companys postretirement plan liabilities to fair value at freshstart resulted in the elimination of unrecognized prior service credits and actuarial losses for its nonpension postretirement plan the elimination of these unrecognized items negatively impacted the companys 2006 expenses by approximately 51 million • aircraft rent was negatively impacted by approximately 101 million this included an unfavorable impact of 66 million related to deferred gains on preemergence saleleaseback transactions that were eliminated as part of freshstart reporting before freshstart reporting these deferred gains were being amortized into earnings over the lease terms as a reduction of the related aircraft rent expense also due to the restructuring of aircraft financings in bankruptcy the companys operating leases were at average rates below market value therefore a deferred charge was recorded to adjust these leases to fair value amortization of this deferred charge resulted in additional rent expense of approximately 35 million in 2006 • the company recognized additional noncash interest expense of approximately 51 million for the amortization of debt and capital lease obligation discounts that were recorded upon its emergence from bankruptcy to adjust its debt and capital lease obligations to fair value • the january 2006 reorganization income of approximately 229 billion and 227 billion for ual and united respectively primarily relates to the discharge of liabilities and other freshstart adjustments recorded in connection with the companys emergence from bankruptcy in 2005 reorganization charges of approximately 206 billion and 204 billion for ual and united respectively were primarily for pension employeerelated and aircraft claim charges of 89 billion 65 billion and 30 billion respectively for additional information see note 1 voluntary reorganization under chapter 11—financial statement presentation in the combined notes to consolidated financial statements • at the companys emergence from bankruptcy there were certain unresolved matters which are considered to be preconfirmation contingencies the company initially recorded on the effective date an obligation for its best estimate of the amounts it expected to pay to resolve these matters adjustments to these initial estimates are recorded in current results of operations see note 1 voluntary reorganization under chapter 11—claims resolution process in the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to these adjustments united 

from 2006 to 2007 the improvement in uniteds results was largely consistent with that of ual with uniteds 2007 net income improving to 402 million as compared to ual s 2007 net income of 403 million the primary difference between uniteds and ual s net income for the combined twelve months of 2006 was a 225 million variance in reorganization income that was primarily due to 239 million of additional ual income from the discharge of certain bankruptcy claims and liabilities that existed at ual but not at united in 2005 ual s net loss was approximately 140 million greater than uniteds loss due to a 131 million larger bankruptcyrelated impairment charge on lease certificates 

liquidity as of december 31 2007 ual had total cash including restricted cash and shortterm investments of 43 billion the companys strong cash position resulted from its recapitalization upon emergence from bankruptcy together with strong operating cash flows of 21 billion in 2007 as 

compared to 16 billion in 2006 and 11 billion in 2005 ual used cash of approximately 257 million to pay a 215 per common share special distribution in january 2008 

in addition the company reduced its balance sheet debt during 2007 by approximately 22 billion most of the debt reduction related to the companys credit facility which was reduced by 15 billion in 2007 the company amended its credit facility twice during 2007 and prepaid debt following its february 2007 and december 2007 amendments total debt consisting of onbalance sheet debt the denver municipal bonds estimated offbalance sheet debt related to operating leases and open market debt repurchases decreased by 23 billion 

the company has significant noncancelable contractual cash payment obligations associated with debt and aircraft and facility leases among others in addition the company has aircraft purchase commitments however the commitments are generally cancelable however the cancellations could result in forfeiture of the companys deposits see the liquidity and capital resources section below for further information related to the credit facility amendments and the companys contractual obligations 

contingencies during the course of its chapter 11 proceedings the company successfully reached settlements with most of its creditors and resolved most pending claims against the debtors the following discussion provides a summary of the material matters yet to be resolved in the bankruptcy court as well as other contingencies for further information on these matters see note 1 voluntary reorganization under chapter 11—significant matters remaining to be resolved in chapter 11 cases and note 15 commitments contingent liabilities and uncertainties in the combined notes to consolidated financial statements  

municipal bond obligation  offbalance sheet financing we are a party to numerous longterm agreements to lease certain airport and maintenance facilities that are financed through taxexempt municipal bonds issued by various local municipalities to build or improve airport and maintenance facilities united had been advised during its restructuring that these municipal bonds may have been unsecured or in certain instances partially secured prepetition debt in 2006 certain of uniteds municipal bond obligations relating to lax and sfo were conclusively adjudicated through the bankruptcy court as financings and not true leases however there remains pending litigation to determine the value of the security interests if any that the bondholders at lax and sfo have in our underlying leaseholds 

united has guaranteed 270 million of the city and county of denver colorado special facilities airport revenue bonds united air lines project series 2007a the denver bonds this guarantee replaces our prior guarantee of 261 million of bonds issued by the city and county of denver colorado in 1992 these bonds are callable by united the outstanding bonds and related guarantee are not recorded in the companys statements of consolidated financial position  however the related lease agreement is accounted for on a straightline basis resulting in a ratable accrual of the final 270 million payment over the lease term 

legal and environmental the company has certain contingencies resulting from litigation and claims incident to the ordinary course of business management believes after considering a number of factors including but not limited to the information currently available the views of legal counsel the nature of contingencies to which the company is subject and prior experience that the ultimate disposition of the litigation and claims will not materially affect the companys consolidated financial position or results of operations when appropriate the company accrues for these matters based on its assessments of the likely outcomes of their eventual disposition the amounts of these liabilities could increase or decrease in the near term based on revisions to estimates relating to the various claims 

the company anticipates that if ultimately found liable its damages from claims arising from the events of september 11 2001 could be significant however the company believes that under the air transportation safety and system stabilization act of 2001 its liability will be limited to its insurance coverage 

the company is also currently analyzing whether any potential liability may result from air cargopassenger surcharge cartel investigations following the receipt of a statement of objections that the european commission the commission issued to 26 carriers on december 18 2007 the statement of objections sets out evidence related to the utilization of fuel and security surcharges and exchange of pricing information that the commission views as supporting the conclusion that an illegal pricefixing cartel had been in operation in the air cargo transportation industry united received a copy of the statement of objections and is currently evaluating the commissions evidence related to the company and its personnel united is cooperating with the commissions investigation united intends to defend itself vigorously against these charges in its formal response to the commission and in the european court of justice if necessary the companys evaluation of this matter is still in the early stages and based upon the information currently available no reserve for potential liability has been recorded as of december 31 2007 however penalties for violation of european competition laws can be substantial and a finding that the company engaged in improper activity could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

many aspects of uniteds operations are subject to increasingly stringent federal state and local laws protecting the environment future regulatory developments in the us and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in the airline industry for example potential future actions that may be taken by the us government state governments within the us foreign governments or the international civil aviation organization to limit the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry are uncertain at this time but the impact to the company and its industry would likely be adverse and could be significant including the potential for increased fuel costs carbon taxes or fees or a requirement to purchase carbon credits 

results of operations 

as described in the overview section above presentation of the combined twelve month period of 2006 is a nongaap measure however management believes it is useful for comparison with the full years of 2007 and 2005 uniteds operating revenues and operating expenses comprise nearly 100 of ual s revenues and operating expenses therefore the following qualitative discussion is applicable to both ual and united unless otherwise noted any significant differences between ual and united results are separately disclosed and explained 

ual s earnings from operations of 10 billion in 2007 improved by 590 million as compared to earnings from operations of 447 million in 2006 the significant increase in operating earnings was due to increased revenues cost control and special items as discussed below ual s net income was 403 million in 2007 as compared to 229 billion in 2006 the most significant variance is reorganization income of 229 billion that was recorded in the 2006 period lower interest expense due to debt reductions and refinancings and a gain on the sale of an investment as discussed below also benefited 2007 net income as compared to 2006 

uniteds improvement in earnings from operations of 573 million was consistent with ual s results uniteds net income was 402 million in 2007 as compared to net income of 227 billion in 2006 with the difference in net income primarily due to reorganization income that was recorded in the 2006 period see note 1 voluntary reorganization under chapter 11—financial statement presentation in combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on reorganization items 

operating revenues 

2007 compared to 2006 

the table below illustrates the yearoveryear percentage changes in ual and united operating revenues the primary difference between ual and united revenues is due to other revenues at ual which are generated from minor direct subsidiaries of ual 

 a the combined 2006 period includes the results for one month ended january 31 2006 predecessor company and eleven months ended december 31 2006 successor company the table below presents selected ual and united passenger revenues and operating data from our mainline segment broken out by geographic region and from our united express segment expressed as yearoveryear changes passenger revenues presented below include the effects of the 45 million special revenue items on mainline 37 million and united express 8 million revenue which resulted directly from the companys ongoing efforts to resolve certain bankruptcy preconfirmation contingencies 

 a variances are from the combined 2006 period that includes the results for the one month period ended january 31 2006 predecessor and the eleven month period ended december 31 2006 successor b yield is a measure of average price paid per passenger mile which is calculated by dividing passenger revenues by rpms yields for geographic regions exclude charter revenue and rpms including the special revenue items mainline and united express passenger revenues increased by 924 million and 170 million respectively in 2007 as compared to 2006 in 2007 mainline revenues benefited from a 06 point increase in load factor and a 7 increase in yield as compared to 2006 in the same periods united express load factor was relatively flat while yield and traffic both increased 

3 resulting in the 6 increase in revenue overall passenger revenues increased due to a better revenue environment for the industry which was partly due to industrywide capacity constraint the companys shift of some capacity and traffic from domestic to higher yielding international flights also benefited revenues in 2007 in addition the change in the mileage plus expiration period policy also contributed to the increase in revenues in 2007 mileage plus revenue included in passenger revenues was approximately 169 million higher in 2007 this impact was largely due to a change in the mileage plus expiration period policy from 36 months to 18 months as discussed in critical accounting policies  below mileage plus customer accounts are deactivated after 18 months of inactivity effective december 31 2007 severe winter storms in december 2007 at the chicago and denver hubs resulted in the cancellation of approximately 6400 united and united express flights at these locations and had the estimated impact of reducing revenue by 25 million and reducing total expenses by 2 million similarly in december 2006 the chicago and denver hubs canceled approximately 3900 united and united express flights with an estimated impact of reducing revenue and total expenses by 40 million and 11 million respectively 

cargo revenues increased by 20 million or 3 in the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to the same period in 2006 freight revenue increased due to both higher yields and higher volume this increase was partially offset by a reduction in mail revenue due to lower 2007 volume as a result of the termination of the us postal service usps contract on june 30 2006 united signed a new usps contract effective april 2007 

ual other operating revenues decreased by 311 million or 24 in the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to the same period in 2006 lower jet fuel sales to third parties by our subsidiary united aviation fuels corporation uafc accounted for 307 million of the other revenue decrease this decrease in jet fuel sales was due to several factors including decreased uafc sales to our regional affiliates our decision not to renew various low margin supply agreements to other carriers and decreased sales of excess inventory this decrease had no material impact on the companys operating margin because uafc cost of sales decreased by 306 million in the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to the prior year 

2006 compared to 2005 

the following table illustrates the yearoveryear dollar and percentage changes in major categories of ual s and uniteds operating revenues 

 a the combined 2006 period includes the results for one month ended january 31 2006 predecessor company and eleven months ended december 31 2006 successor company strong demand industry capacity restraint yield improvements uniteds resource optimization initiatives and ongoing airline network optimization all contributed to a 20 billion increase in total 

operating revenue to 193 billion in 2006 the 11 mainline passenger revenue increase was due to both increased traffic and higher average ticket prices united reported a 3 increase in mainline traffic on a 2 increase in capacity and an 8 increase in yield severe winter storms in december 2006 at the chicago and denver hubs which resulted in the cancellation of approximately 3900 united and united express flights at these locations had the estimated impact of reducing revenue by 40 million and reducing total expenses by 11 million as discussed in critical accounting policies below the company changed the accounting for its frequent flyer obligation to a deferred revenue model upon its emergence from bankruptcy which negatively impacted revenues by 158 million this resulted in increased deferred revenue due to a net increase in miles earned by mileage plus customers that will be redeemed in future years 

in 2005 ual s other revenues were 75 million more than uniteds other revenues primarily due to revenues generated by ual s direct subsidiary mypoints which was sold by ual in 2006 

the 19 increase in regional affiliate revenues was also due to traffic and yield improvements as indicated in the table below 

the increase in cargo revenue was primarily due to improved yield which was partially due to higher fuel surcharges between periods 

the table below presents selected passenger revenues and operating data by geographic region and the companys mainline and united express segments expressed as periodtoperiod changes 

 a the combined 2006 period includes the results for one month ended january 31 2006 predecessor company and eleven months ended december 31 2006 successor company b yields for geographic regions exclude charter revenue and revenue passenger miles 41 

operating expenses 

2007 compared to 2006 

the table below includes the yearoveryear dollar and percentage changes in ual and united operating expenses significant fluctuations are discussed below 

 a the combined period includes the results for one month ended january 31 2006 predecessor company and eleven months ended december 31 2006 successor company as discussed in note 2 summary of significant accounting policies in combined notes to consolidated financial statements distribution expenses include commissions gds fees and credit card transaction fees prior period information has been reclassified to conform to the current period 

presentation previously gds and credit card transaction fees were classified as components of purchased services and commissions were reported as a separate expense item in the ual and united 2006 annual reports 

mainline aircraft fuel increased 179 million or 4 in the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 2006 this net fuel variance was due to a 4 increase in the average price per gallon of jet fuel from 211 in 2006 to 218 in 2007 resulting from unfavorable market conditions included in the 2007 average price per gallon was an 83 million net hedge gain a net fuel hedge loss of 26 million is included in the 2006 average price per gallon 

ual salaries and related costs remained relatively flat in 2007 as compared to 2006 the company recognized 49 million of sharebased compensation expense in 2007 as compared to 159 million in 2006 there were no significant grants in 2007 as compared to 2006 which included a large number of grants associated with the companys emergence from bankruptcy additionally immediate recognition of 100 of the cost of awards granted to retirementeligible employees on the grant date together with accelerated vesting of grants within the first twelve months after the grant date accounted for most of the decrease in sharebased compensation expense also benefiting the 2007 period was the absence of the 22 million severance charge incurred in 2006 offsetting the decreased sharebased compensation and severance expense was a slight increase in salaries and related costs as a result of certain wage increases as well as a 110 million increase in profit sharing including related employee taxes which is based on annual pretax earnings as noted above this increase is due to increased pretax earnings and an increase in the payout percentage from 75 in 2006 to 15 in 2007 

regional affiliate expense which includes aircraft fuel increased 117 million or 4 during 2007 as compared to 2006 regional affiliate capacity increased 4 in 2007 which was a major contributor to the increase in expense including the special revenue item of 8 million our regional affiliate operating income was 53 million higher in the 2007 period as compared to the 2006 period the margin improvement was due to improved revenue performance which was due to increased yield and traffic and cost control factors impacting regional affiliate margin include the restructuring of regional carrier capacity agreements the replacement of some 50seat regional jets with 70seat regional jets and regional carrier network optimization all of these improvements were put in place throughout 2006 therefore we realized some yearoveryear benefits in 2007 regional affiliate fuel expense increased 81 million or 10 from 834 million in 2006 to 915 million in 2007 due to a 9 increase in the average price of fuel and a 1 increase in consumption 

purchased services were up 8 in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to increased information technology and other costs incurred in support of the companys customer and employee initiatives information technology expenses increased due to an increase in noncapitalizable information technology related expenditures generally occurring during the planning and scoping phases for new applications in 2007 in addition airport operations handling and security costs increased due to the new usps contract and new international routes among other factors 

aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs expense increased 157 million or 16 yearoveryear primarily due to inflationary increases related to our v2500 engine maintenance contract and the cost of component parts as well as the impact of increases in airframe and engine repair volumes 

a charge of 18 million in 2007 for surplus and obsolete aircraft parts inventory accounted for approximately half of the 4 increase in depreciation and amortization 

ongoing efforts to efficiently utilize our rented facilities have offset contractual rent increases keeping 2007 rent expense in line with 2006 rent expense 

in 2007 uniteds mainline revenues increased by 6 during the same period of time distribution expenses which include commissions gds fees and credit card fees decreased 2 from 798 million 

in 2006 to 779 million in 2007 this decrease was due to cost savings realized as the company continues to drive reductions across the full spectrum of costs of sale impact areas included renegotiation of contracts with various channel providers rationalization of commission plans and programs and continued emphasis on movement of customer purchases toward lower cost channels including online channels such efforts resulted in a 9 yearoveryear reduction in gds fees and commissions 

the decrease in cost of sales in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to lower uafc third party fuel sales of 307 million as described in the discussion of revenue variances above 

special items of 44 million in the year ended december 31 2007 include a 30 million benefit due to the reduction in recorded accruals for pending bankruptcy litigation related to our sfo and lax municipal bond obligations and a 14 million benefit due to the companys ongoing efforts to resolve certain other bankruptcy preconfirmation contingencies in the eleven months ended december 31 2006 special items of 36 million included a 12 million benefit to adjust the companys recorded obligation for the sfo and lax municipal bonds and a 24 million benefit related to preconfirmation pension matters the 2007 and 2006 special items resulted from revised estimates of the probable amount to be allowed by the bankruptcy court and were recorded in accordance with aicpa practice bulletin 11 accounting for preconfirmation contingencies in freshstart reporting  see note 1 voluntary reorganization under chapter 11 and note 20 special items in the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on these special items and pending matters 

2006 compared to 2005 

the table below includes the yearoveryear dollar and percentage changes in operating expenses significant fluctuations are discussed below 

 44 

 a the combined period includes the results for one month ended january 31 2006 predecessor company and eleven months ended december 31 2006 successor company in 2006 united implemented a resource optimization initiative that increased the number of mainline asms by 1 and united express asms by 3 for a consolidated asm growth of 2 without the use of additional aircraft in addition to generating increased revenue this contributed to additional variable expenses such as fuel salaries and other expense items 

in 2006 mainline aircraft fuel expense increased 20 due to an increase in average mainline fuel cost from 179 per gallon in 2005 to 211 per gallon in 2006 while fuel consumption increased 2 on a similar increase in mainline capacity the company recognized a net fuel hedge loss of 26 million in aircraft fuel expense in 2006 which is included in the 211 per gallon average cost whereas in 2005 most fuel hedging gains and losses were recorded in nonoperating income and expense in 2005 the company recorded 40 million of fuel hedging gains in nonoperating income as discussed below 

ual s salaries and related costs increased 240 million or 6 in 2006 as compared to the prior year in 2006 the company recorded 159 million of expense representing 4 of the increase in salaries and related costs for successor ual s sharebased compensation plans because of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 sharebased payment effective january 1 2006 in addition the company incurred an additional 26 million related to employee performance incentive programs in 2006 as compared to 2005 the company also recorded 64 million in higher postretirement expenses and 35 million in higher medical and dental expenses in 2006 than in 2005 salaries also increased due to merit increases awarded to employees in 2006 which were infrequent throughout bankruptcy these cost increases were partially offset by a 6 yearoveryear improvement in labor productivity resulting from the companys continuous improvement efforts together with selective outsourcing of certain noncore functions in 2006 the company achieved its goal to reduce 1000 management and administrative positions 

the companys most significant regional affiliate expenses are capacity payments to the regional carriers and fuel expense fuel accounted for 30 of the companys regional affiliate expense in 2006 as compared to 26 in 2005 fuel cost increased due to increased market prices for jet fuel as discussed above and increased fuel consumption from higher capacity the companys regional affiliate 

expense increased only 3 despite a 9 increase in capacity due to the benefits of restructured regional carrier capacity agreements in 2006 along with regional carrier network optimization and the replacement of some 50seat regional jets with 70seat regional jets the 3 increase in regional affiliates expense includes an 18 increase in fuel costs see note 2j summary of significant accounting policies—united express in the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the regional affiliates expense 

the companys purchased services increased 18 in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to an increase of approximately 120 million in outsourcing costs for various noncore work activities as well as a 31 million increase in certain professional fees which were classified as reorganization expenses by the predecessor company the offsetting benefits of higher outsourcing costs are reflected in a 4 reduction in manpower associated with the 6 labor productivity improvement noted for salaries and related costs 

in 2006 aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs expense increased 128 million or 15 from 2005 primarily due to enginerelated maintenance rate increases as well as increased repair volume 

as discussed in note 1 voluntary reorganization under chapter 11—freshstart reporting in the combined notes to consolidated financial statements  the company revalued its assets and liabilities to estimated fair values in 2006 ual s amortization expense increased 162 million due to the recognition of 453 million of additional definitelived intangible assets however this increase was offset by decreased depreciation expense from freshstart reporting adjustments that significantly reduced depreciable tangible asset book values to fair value the impact of the decrease in tangible asset valuation was significant as depreciation and amortization only increased 32 million despite the 162 million increase in intangible asset amortization and incremental depreciation on postemergence property additions the freshstart impacts on uniteds depreciation and amortization expense were not materially different than the ual impacts 

the companys distribution expenses which include commissions gds fees and credit card fees increased 23 million or 3 yearoveryear primarily due to a 24 million increase in credit card fees due to higher passenger revenues 

ual s and uniteds other operating expenses decreased 104 million and 96 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 respectively the adoption of freshstart reporting which included the revaluation of the companys frequent flyer obligation to estimated fair value and the change in accounting policy to a deferred revenue model for the successor company reduced other expense by an estimated 27 million for periods on or after february 1 2006 adjustments to the frequent flyer obligation are recorded to passenger and other operating revenues whereas periodic adjustments under the predecessor companys incremental cost basis were recognized in both operating revenues and other operating expense see critical accounting policies below for further details various cost savings initiatives also reduced the companys costs in 2006 as compared to 2005 

in 2006 the company recognized a net benefit of 36 million to operating expense resulting from the resolution of preconfirmation contingencies for the estimated liability for sfo and lax municipal bond obligations and favorable adjustments to preconfirmation contingencies related to the pilots nonqualified pension plan in 2005 ual and united recognized charges of 18 million and 5 million respectively for aircraft impairments related to the planned accelerated retirement of certain aircraft 

other income expense 

2007 compared to 2006 

the following table illustrates the yearoveryear dollar and percentage changes in other income expense 

 a the combined period includes the results for one month ended january 31 2006 predecessor company and eleven months ended december 31 2006 successor company ual interest expense decreased 109 million or 14 in 2007 as compared to 2006 the decrease was due to the february and december 2007 amendments and prepayments of the credit facility which lowered uniteds interest rate on these obligations and reduced the total obligations outstanding by approximately 15 billion repayments of scheduled maturities of debt obligations and other debt refinancings which are discussed in liquidity and capital resources below also reduced interest expense the 2007 period also included a 22 million reduction in interest expense due to the recognition of a gain on debt extinguishment these benefits were offset by interest expense of 17 million for expensing previously capitalized debt issuance costs that were associated with the february 2007 prepayment of the credit facility and 6 million for financing costs incurred in connection with the february amendment of the credit facility the 500 million amended credit facility prepayment in december 2007 increased interest expense by a net of 4 million from expensing 6 million of previously capitalized credit facility costs and recording a gain of 2 million to recognize previously deferred interest rate swap gains 

ual interest income increased 8 million or 3 yearoveryear interest income increased due to the classification of 6 million of interest income as reorganization items in the january 2006 predecessor period in accordance with sop 907 

the 41 million gain on sale of investment resulted from the companys sale of its 211 interest in arinc 

the unfavorable variances in miscellaneous income expense are primarily due to foreign currency transaction gains of 9 million in 2006 as compared to foreign currency transaction losses of 4 million in 2007 

income taxes 

ual and united recorded income tax expense of 297 million and 296 million an effective tax rate of 43 respectively for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 21 million and 29 million an effective tax rate of 49 and 50 for ual and united respectively for the eleven month period ended december 31 2006 the increase in income tax expense in 2007 was primarily due to a significant increase in pretax income in 2007 as compared to the 2006 successor period due to the companys significant net operating losses in prior periods cash paid for taxes in 2007 was only 10 million see note 6 income taxes in the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of permanent items impacting the effective tax rates 

2006 compared to 2005 

the following table illustrates the yearoveryear dollar and percentage changes in consolidated other income expense 

 a the combined period includes the results for one month ended january 31 2006 predecessor company and eleven months ended december 31 2006 successor company ual and united incurred 288 million and 279 million respectively of increases in interest expense partly due to the higher outstanding principal balance of the credit facility for the successor company as compared to the lower debtorinpossession credit facility the dip financing balance for the predecessor company interest expense in 2006 was also unfavorably impacted by the associated amortization of various discounts which were recorded on debt instruments and capital leases to record these obligations at fair value upon the adoption of freshstart reporting ual s and uniteds 2006 interest income increased 211million and 220 million respectively reflecting a higher cash balance in 2006 as well as higher rates of return on certain investments interest income also increased due to the 

classification of most interest income in 2005 as a component of reorganization expense in accordance with sop 907 in 2005 the company recorded 40 million of fuel hedge gains which did not qualify for hedge accounting in nonoperating income while in 2006 the 26 million net realized and unrealized loss from economic fuel hedges was recognized in aircraft fuel expense 

see note 1 voluntary reorganization under chapter 11—financial statement presentation in the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for information on reorganization items net recognized in january 2006 and during the year ended december 31 2005 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table provides a summary of uals and uniteds cash position at december 31 2007 and 2006 and net cash provided used by operating financing and investing activities for the year ended december 31 2007 the eleven month period ended december 31 2006 and the one month period ended january 31 2006 

   a the combined period includes the results for the one month period ended january 31 2006 predecessor and the eleven month period ended december 31 2006 successor the companys significant cash and shortterm investment position represents a source of liquidity the company believes that it should have sufficient liquidity to fund its operating and capital cash requirements for 2008 through cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments cash generated from operations and general corporate financings the change in cash from 2005 to 2007 is explained below restricted cash primarily represents cash collateral to secure workers compensation obligations security deposits for airport leases and reserves with institutions that process our credit card ticket sales we may be required to post significant additional cash collateral to meet such obligations in the future 

liquidity ual s total of cash and cash equivalents restricted cash and shortterm investments was 43 billion and 50 billion at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively including restricted cash of 756 million and 847 million respectively the company used its strong operating cash flows to reduce its debt balances by approximately 15 billion through its credit facility prepayments of 972 million in february 2007 and 500 million in december 2007 the amended credit facility 

consists of an initial 18 billion term loan in february 2007 which was paid down to 13 billion at december 31 2007 and a 255 million revolving commitment of which 153 million was available at december 31 2007 

certain terms of the credit facility were amended in february 2007 thereby creating the amended credit facility a further amendment in december 2007 authorizes certain shareholder initiatives this enabled ual to pay a 215 per common share special distribution of approximately 257 million on january 23 2008 at the companys option interest payments on the amended credit facility are based on either a base rate as defined in the amended credit facility or at libor plus 2 this applicable margin on libor rate loans is a significant reduction of 175 from the terms of the credit facility the february 2007 amendment released a significant amount of assets that had been pledged as collateral under the credit facility see the capital commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements section below for information related to scheduled maturities on the credit facility 

in january 2007 the company decided to terminate the interest rate swap that had been used to hedge the future interest payments under the original credit facility term loan of 245 billion 

restricted cash primarily represents cash collateral to secure workers compensation obligations security deposits for airport leases and reserves with institutions that process uniteds credit card ticket sales certain of the credit card processing arrangements are based on the aggregate thenoutstanding bank card air traffic liability the companys credit rating and its compliance with certain debt covenants credit rating downgrades or debt covenant noncompliance could materially increase the companys reserve requirements 

cash flows from operating activities 

2007 compared to 2006 

the companys cash from operations improved by more than 500 million yearoveryear the companys improvement in net income excluding reorganization items which are primarily noncash was a significant factor contributing to the increase in operating cash flows operating cash flows for 2007 also include the favorable impact of an increase in noncash income tax expense of nearly 300 million as compared to 2006 cash from operations improved due to the companys improved performance in 2007 as discussed above in the results of operations section above in addition cash from operations improved due to a reduction of 124 million in cash interest payments in 2007 as compared to 2006 as a result of the financing activities completed in 2007 to reduce debt and interest rates the improvement in cash generated from operations that was due to better operating performance was further enhanced by a decrease in operating cash used for working capital in 2007 the company contributed approximately 236 million and 14 million to its defined contribution plans and nonus pension plans respectively as compared to contributions of 270 million in 2006 for these plans 

2006 compared to 2005 

the company generated cash from operations of 16 billion in 2006 compared to 11 billion in 2005 the higher operating cash flow generated in 2006 was due to improved results of operations as discussed above in the results of operation section together with differences in the timing and amount of working capital items and other smaller changes as discussed in the results of operations section above the companys 2006 net income includes significant noncash items 

the company does not have any significant defined benefit pension plan contribution requirements as most of the companysponsored plans were replaced with defined contribution plans upon its emergence from bankruptcy the company contributed approximately 259 million and 

11 million to its defined contribution plans and nonus pension plans respectively in the eleven months ended december 31 2006 

cash flows from investing activities 

2007 compared to 2006 

ual s and uniteds cash released from restricted funds was 91 million and 87 million respectively in 2007 as compared to 310 million and 319 million that was provided by a decrease in the segregated and restricted funds for ual and united respectively in 2006 the significant cash generated from restricted accounts in 2006 was due to our improved financial position upon our emergence from bankruptcy net purchases of shortterm investments used cash of 20 billion for both ual and united in 2007 as compared to cash used for net purchases of shortterm investments of 02 billion in 2006 this change was due to investing additional excess cash in longerterm commercial paper in 2007 to increase investment yields investing activities in 2007 also includes the companys use of 96 million of cash to acquire certain of the companys previously issued and outstanding debt instruments the debt instruments repurchased by the company remain outstanding see note 12 debt obligations in combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further information related to the 96 million of purchased debt securities 

the companys capital expenditures were 658 million and 362 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively including the purchase of six aircraft during 2007 in the third quarter of 2007 the company purchased three 747400 aircraft that had previously been financed by united through operating leases which were terminated at closing the total purchase price for these aircraft was largely financed with certain proceeds from the secured eetc financing described below these transactions did not result in any change in the companys fleet count of 460 mainline aircraft or in the amount of aircraft encumbered by debt or lease agreements 

during the fourth quarter of 2007 the company used existing cash to acquire three aircraft that were previously financed under operating lease agreements the total purchase price of these three aircraft and the three aircraft acquired in the third quarter of 2007 was approximately 200 million this purchase did not result in any change in the companys fleet count of 460 mainline aircraft but did unencumber three aircraft 

in addition in the fourth quarter of 2007 the company utilized existing aircraft deposits pursuant to the terms of the original capital lease to make the final lease payments on three aircraft resulting in the reclassification of the aircraft from capital leased assets to owned assets however the purchase of these three aircraft did not result in a net change in cash because the company had previously provided cash deposits equal to the purchase price of the aircraft to third party financial institutions for the benefit of the lessor these transactions resulted in three additional aircraft becoming unencumbered for a total increase of six unencumbered aircraft during the year 

during 2007 the company sold its interest in arinc generating proceeds of 128 million in 2006 ual received 43 million more in cash proceeds from investing activities as compared to united primarily due to 56 million of proceeds from the sale of mypoints a former direct subsidiary of ual 

2006 compared to 2005 

cash released from segregated funds after exit from bankruptcy in 2006 provided 200 million in cash proceeds ual s sale of the subsidiary mypointscom inc generated an additional 56 million in cash proceeds in 2006 as compared to 2005 ual s and uniteds cash used for increases in shortterm investments in 2006 was 235 million and 231 million respectively as compared to no material purchases or sales of shortterm investments in 2005 a reduction in restricted cash balances provided 110 million and 119 million of cash proceeds in 2006 for ual and united respectively as compared 

to cash used to increase restricted cash of 80 million and 72 million in 2005 for ual and united respectively 

the 39 million of cash provided during 2006 from the disposition of property and equipment included 19 million of cash proceeds from the sale of nine nonoperating b767200 aircraft the company used 362 million in cash for the acquisition of property and equipment in 2006 as compared to approximately 470 million in 2005 

cash flows from financing activities 

2007 compared to 2006 

cash used by financing activities for both ual and united was 21 billion in 2007 as compared to 08 billion of cash provided by financing activities during 2006 in 2007 cash of approximately 29 billion was used to prepay approximately 15 billion of credit facility obligations refinance certain aircraft as discussed below and to make other debt and capital lease payments 

in 2007 the company completed financing transactions totaling approximately 964 million which included the 694 million eetc secured financing and the 270 million denver airport financing a portion of the proceeds of the 694 million eetc transaction was used to payoff 590 million of debt obligations that were secured by ten previously mortgaged owned aircraft and to finance three previously unencumbered owned aircraft the proceeds of the denver airport bonds were used to refinance the former 261 million of denver series 1992a bonds 

in both february and december 2007 united amended certain terms of its credit facility the february 2007 amendment resulted in a reduction in the amount of the amended credit facility from 30 billion to 2055 billion consisting of a 18 billion term loan commitment and a 255 million revolving commitment the december 2007 amendment allowed the company to pay the january 2008 special distribution of 257 million and provides the company the ability to undertake an additional 243 million in future shareholder initiatives without any additional prepayment at december 31 2007 153 million was available for loans or standby letters of credit under the amended credit facility see note 12 debt obligations in combined notes to consolidated financial statements for further information related to the financing transactions discussed above 

in 2007 cash from aircraft lease deposits increased 80 million primarily due to the use of the deposits to purchase the three previously leased assets described above in cash flows from investing activities this was reported as a financing cash inflow as the prepayment of the initial deposits were recorded as a financing cash outflow 

during 2006 we generated proceeds of 30 billion from uniteds new credit facility but used approximately 21 billion of these proceeds to repay the 12 billion dip financing and make other scheduled and revolving payments under longterm debt and capital lease agreements 

2006 compared to 2005 

cash generated through financing activities was 782 million in 2006 compared to cash used of 110 million in 2005 in 2006 the company made principal payments under longterm debt and capital lease obligations totaling 21 billion which included 12 billion for the repayment of the dip financing 

in 2006 the company obtained access to up to 30 billion in secured exit financing which consisted of a 245 billion term loan a 350 million delayed draw term loan and a 200 million revolving credit line on the effective date 245 billion of the 28 billion term loan and the entire revolving credit line was drawn and used to repay the dip financing and to make other payments required upon exit from bankruptcy as well as to provide ongoing liquidity to conduct 

postreorganization operations subsequently the company repaid borrowings under the revolving credit line and accessed the remaining 350 million on the delayed draw term loan at december 31 2006 the company had a total of 28 billion of debt and 63 million in letters of credit outstanding under this credit facility 

during 2006 the company secured control of 14 aircraft that were included in the 19971 eetc transaction by remitting 281 million to the 19971 eetc trustee on behalf of the holders of the tranche a certificates the company subsequently refinanced the 14 aircraft on march 28 2006 with the 350 million delayed draw term loan provided under the credit facility the 14 aircraft are comprised of four b737 aircraft two b747 aircraft four b777 aircraft and four a320 aircraft 

significant 2006 noncash financing and investment activities included the conversion of six b757 aircraft and one b747 aircraft from leased to owned status resulting in additional aircraft assets and debt obligations of 242 million in addition in the first quarter of 2006 the successor company completed a transaction that converted certain mortgaged aircraft to capital leases for 155 million see note 17 statement of consolidated cash flows—supplemental disclosures in the combined notes to consolidated financial statements  

capital commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements the companys business is very capital intensive requiring significant amounts of capital to fund the acquisition of assets particularly aircraft in the past the company has funded the acquisition of aircraft through outright purchase by issuing debt by entering into capital or operating leases or through vendor financings the company also often enters into longterm lease commitments with airports to ensure access to terminal cargo maintenance and other required facilities 

the table below provides a summary of the companys material contractual obligations as of december 31 2007 amounts presented are for both ual and united except as noted below 

 a uniteds debt obligations are approximately 3 million lower than ual s due to 3 million of debt obligations of a direct subsidiary of ual longterm debt includes 127 million of noncash obligations as these debt payments are made directly to the creditor by a third party lessee of the aircraft and the creditors only recourse to united is repossession of the aircraft uniteds aircraft lease payments are 7 million higher than uals because united leases one aircraft from a direct subsidiary of ual b future interest payments on variable rate debt are estimated using estimated future variable rates based on a yield curve 53 

c mainline includes nonaircraft capital lease payments of 5 million in each of the years 2008 through 2011 united express payments are all for aircraft united has lease deposits of 516 million in separate accounts to meet certain of its future capital lease obligations d amounts represent lease payments that are made by united under capacity agreements with the regional carriers who operate these aircraft on uniteds behalf e amounts represent postretirement benefit payments net of subsidy receipts through 2017 benefit payments approximate plan contributions as plans are substantially unfunded not included in the table above are contributions related to the companys foreign pension plans the company does not have any significant contributions required by government regulations the companys expected pension plan contributions for 2008 are 29 million f amounts are principally for aircraft and exclude advance payments the company has the right to cancel its commitments for the purchase of 42 a319 and a320 aircraft however such action could cause the forfeiture of 91 million of advance payments g represents estimated uncertain income tax position liabilities in accordance with fin 48 the settlement period is undeterminable see note 2j summary of significant accounting policies—united express note 9 retirement and postretirement plans note 12 debt obligations and note 16 lease obligations in the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these items 

offbalance sheet arrangements an offbalance sheet arrangement is any transaction agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has 1 made guarantees 2 a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets 3 an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or 4 any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to the company or that engages in leasing hedging or research and development arrangements with the company the companys offbalance sheet arrangements include operating leases which are summarized in the contractual obligations table above and certain municipal bond obligations as discussed below and letters of credit of which 102 million was outstanding at december 31 2007 

certain municipalities issued municipal bonds on behalf of united to finance the construction of improvements at airportrelated facilities the company also leases facilities at airports where municipal bonds funded at least some of the construction of airportrelated projects at december 31 2007 the company guaranteed interest and principal payments on 270 million in principal of such bonds that were originally issued in 1992 subsequently refinanced in 2007 and are due in 2032 unless the company elects not to extend its lease in which case the bonds are due in 2023 the outstanding bonds and related guarantee are not recorded in the companys statements of consolidated financial position in accordance with gaap the related lease agreement is accounted for as an operating lease and the related rent expense is recorded on a straightline basis the annual lease payments through 2023 and the final payment for the principal amount of the bonds are included in the operating lease payments in the contractual obligations table above for further details see note 15 commitments contingent liabilities and uncertainties—guarantees and offbalance sheet financing in the combined notes to consolidated financial statements  

fuel consortia the company participates in numerous fuel consortia with other carriers at major airports to reduce the costs of fuel distribution and storage interline agreements govern the rights and responsibilities of the consortia members and provide for the allocation of the overall costs to operate the consortia based on usage the consortia and in limited cases the participating carriers have entered into longterm agreements to lease certain airport fuel storage and distribution facilities that are typically financed through taxexempt bonds either special facilities lease revenue bonds or general airport revenue bonds issued by various local municipalities in general each consortium lease 

agreement requires the consortium to make lease payments in amounts sufficient to pay the maturing principal and interest payments on the bonds as of december 31 2007 approximately 890 million principal amount of such bonds were secured by significant fuel facility leases in which united participates as to which united and each of the signatory airlines have provided indirect guarantees of the debt uniteds exposure is approximately 195 million principal amount of such bonds based on its recent consortia participation the companys exposure could increase if the participation of other carriers decreases the guarantees will expire when the taxexempt bonds are paid in full which ranges from 2010 to 2028 the company did not record a liability at the time these indirect guarantees were made 

debt covenants the company was in compliance with the amended credit facility covenants as of december 31 2007 as part of the amendment to the credit facility completed in february 2007 several covenants were amended to provide the company more flexibility the amended credit facility contains covenants that may limit the ability of united and the guarantors to among other things incur or guarantee additional indebtedness create liens pay dividends on or repurchase stock make certain types of investments pay dividends or other payments from uniteds direct or indirect subsidiaries enter into transactions with affiliates sell assets or merge with other companies modify corporate documents or change lines of business the amended credit facility also requires compliance with certain financial covenants failure to comply with the covenants could result in a default under the amended credit facility unless the company were to obtain a waiver of or otherwise mitigate or cure any such default additionally the amended credit facility contains a crossdefault provision with respect to other credit arrangements that exceed 50 million a payment default could result in a termination of the amended credit facility and a requirement to accelerate repayment of all outstanding facility borrowings for further details about the amended credit facility and the associated covenants see note 12 debt obligations in the combined notes to consolidated financial statements 

future financing subject to the restrictions of its amended credit facility the company could raise additional capital by issuing unsecured debt equity or equitylike securities monetizing or borrowing against certain assets or refinancing existing obligations to generate net cash proceeds however the availability and capacity of these funding sources cannot be assured or predicted general economic conditions poor credit market conditions and any adverse changes in the companys credit ratings could adversely impact the companys ability to raise capital if needed and could increase the companys cost of capital 

credit ratings as of december 31 2007 the company had a corporate credit rating of b outlook stable from standard  poors and a corporate family rating of b2 outlook stable from moodys investors services these ratings are unchanged from the ratings received upon the companys exit from bankruptcy these credit ratings are below investment grade levels downgrades from these rating levels could restrict the availability andor increase the cost of future financing for the company

critical accounting policies 

critical accounting policies are defined as those that are affected by significant judgments and uncertainties which potentially could result in materially different accounting under different assumptions and conditions the company has prepared the accompanying financial statements in conformity with gaap which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions the company has identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of these financial statements 

passenger revenue recognition the value of unused passenger tickets and miscellaneous charge orders mcos is included in current liabilities as advance ticket sales united records passenger ticket sales and tickets sold by other airlines for use on united as operating revenues when the transportation is provided or when the ticket expires tickets sold by other airlines are recorded at the estimated values to be billed to the other airlines nonrefundable tickets generally expire on the date of the intended flight unless the date is extended by notification from the customer on or before the intended flight date fees charged in association with changes or extensions to nonrefundable tickets are recorded as passenger revenue at the time the fee is incurred change fees related to nonrefundable tickets are considered a separate transaction from the air transportation because they represent a charge for the companys additional service to modify a previous reservation therefore the pricing of the change fee and the initial customer reservation are separately determined and represent distinct earnings processes refundable tickets expire after one year mcos can be either exchanged for a passenger ticket or refunded after issuance united records an estimate of tickets that have been used but not recorded as revenue due to system processing errors as revenue in the month of sale based on historical results united also records an estimate of mcos that will not be exchanged or refunded as revenue ratably over the validity period based on historical results due to complex industry pricing structures refund and exchange policies and interline agreements with other airlines certain amounts are recognized as revenue using estimates both as to the timing of recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized these estimates are based on the evaluation of actual historical results 

frequent flyer accounting in accordance with freshstart reporting the company revalued its frequent flyer obligation to estimated fair value at the effective date which resulted in a 24 billion increase to the frequent flyer obligation the successor company elected to change its accounting policy for its mileage plus frequent flyer program to a deferred revenue model the company believes that accounting for frequent flyer miles using a deferred revenue model is preferable as it establishes a consistent valuation methodology for both miles earned by frequent flyers and miles sold to nonairline business partners 

before the effective date the predecessor company used the historical industry practice of accounting for frequent flyer miles earned on united flights on an incremental cost basis as an accrued liability and as advertising expense while miles sold to nonairline business partners were accounted for on a deferred revenue basis as of the effective date the deferred revenue value of all frequent flyer miles are measured using equivalent ticket fair value as described below and all associated adjustments are made to passenger revenues 

the deferred revenue measurement method used to record fair value of the frequent flyer obligation on and after the effective date was to allocate an equivalent weightedaverage ticket value to each outstanding mile based upon projected redemption patterns for available award choices when such miles are consumed such value was estimated assuming redemptions on both united and other 

participating carriers in the mileage plus program and by estimating the relative proportions of awards to be redeemed by class of service within broad geographic regions of the companys operations including north america atlantic pacific and latin america 

under the new method of accounting adopted for this program at the effective date the company reduced operating revenue by approximately 158 million in the eleven months ended december 31 2006 to account for the effects of the program as compared to the reduction in revenues that would have been recognized using the predecessor companys accounting method the companys new accounting policy does not continue the use of the former incremental cost method which impacted revenues and advertising expense under that prior policy assuming the use of the predecessor companys accounting for this program for the eleven months ended december 31 2006 the company estimates that it would have recorded approximately 27 million of additional advertising expense 

the estimation of the fair value of each award mile requires the use of several significant assumptions for which significant management judgment is required for example management must estimate how many miles are projected to be redeemed on united versus on other airline partners since the equivalent ticket value of miles redeemed on united and on other carriers can vary greatly this assumption can materially affect the calculation of the weightedaverage ticket value from period to period 

management must also estimate the expected redemption patterns of mileage plus customers who have a number of different award choices when redeeming their miles each of which can have materially different estimated fair values such choices include different classes of service first business and several coach award levels as well as different flight itineraries such as domestic and international routings and different itineraries within domestic and international regions of uniteds and other participating carriers flight networks customer redemption patterns may also be influenced by program changes which occur from time to time and introduce new award choices or make material changes to the terms of existing award choices management must often estimate the probable impact of such program changes on future customer behavior using limited data which requires the use of significant judgment management uses historical customer redemption patterns as the best single indicator of future redemption behavior in making its estimates but changes in customer mileage redemption behavior to patterns which are not consistent with historical behavior can result in material changes to deferred revenue balances and to recognized revenue 

managements estimate of the expected expiration of miles as of the freshstart date and for recognition of expiration postemergence also requires significant management judgment for customer accounts which are inactive for a period of 36 consecutive months it had been uniteds policy to cancel all miles contained in those accounts at the end of the 36 month period of inactivity in early 2007 the company announced that it was reducing the expiration period from 36 months to 18 months effective december 31 2007 under its deferred revenue accounting policy effective in 2006 the company recognized revenue from expiration of miles by amortizing such estimated expiration over the 36 month expiration period in 2007 the company began to amortize revenue from the expiration of miles over an 18 month expiration period current and future changes to program rules and program redemption opportunities can significantly alter customer behavior from historical patterns with respect to inactive accounts the change in the expiration period increased revenues by 246 million in 2007 changes to expiration assumptions or to the expiration policy may result in material changes to the deferred revenue balance as well as recognized revenues from the program a hypothetical 1 change in the companys estimated expiration rate as of december 31 2007 would have approximately a 21 million effect on the liability 

at december 31 2007 and 2006 the companys outstanding number of miles was approximately 4884 billion and 5088 billion respectively the company estimates that approximately 4166 billion of 

the outstanding miles at december 31 2007 will ultimately be redeemed based on assumptions as of december 31 2007 and accordingly has recorded deferred revenue of 38 billion at december 31 2007 a hypothetical 1 change in the companys outstanding number of miles or the weightedaverage ticket value has approximately a 43 million effect on the liability 

accounting for longlived assets uals and uniteds net book value of operating property and equipment was 114 billion and 113 billion respectively at december 31 2007 and 115 billion and 114 billion respectively at december 31 2006 in addition to the original cost of these assets as adjusted by freshstart reporting at february 1 2006 their recorded value is impacted by a number of accounting policy elections including the estimation of useful lives and residual values and when necessary the recognition of asset impairment charges 

except for the adoption of freshstart reporting at february 1 2006 whereby the company remeasured longlived assets at fair value it is the companys policy to record assets acquired including aircraft at acquisition cost depreciable life is determined through economic analysis such as reviewing existing fleet plans obtaining appraisals and comparing estimated lives to other airlines that operate similar fleets older generation aircraft are assigned lives that are generally consistent with the experience of united and the practice of other airlines as aircraft technology has improved useful life has increased and the company has generally estimated the lives of those aircraft to be 30 years residual values are estimated based on historical experience with regard to the sale of both aircraft and spare parts and are established in conjunction with the estimated useful lives of the related fleets residual values are based on current dollars when the aircraft are acquired and typically reflect asset values that have not reached the end of their physical life both depreciable lives and residual values are revised periodically to recognize changes in the companys fleet plan and other relevant information a one year increase in the average depreciable life of our flight equipment would reduce annual depreciation expense on flight equipment by approximately 20 million 

in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets the company evaluates the carrying value of longlived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist the companys policy is to recognize an impairment charge when an assets carrying value exceeds its net undiscounted future cash flows and its fair market value the amount of the charge is the difference between the assets book value and fair market value the company estimates the undiscounted future cash flows for its various aircraft with output from financial models used by the company to make fleet and scheduling decisions these models utilize projections on passenger yield fuel costs labor costs and other relevant factors many of which require the exercise of significant judgment on the part of management changes in these projections may expose the company to future impairment charges by raising the threshold which future cash flows need to meet if a triggering event requiring impairment testing occurs the company also evaluates the remaining useful lives of these assets to determine whether the lives are still appropriate typically the company utilizes knowledge from personnel in its fleet planning and maintenance departments along with other external factors to determine whether the remaining useful lives are appropriate see note 2g summary of significant accounting policies—operating property and equipment in the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the companys policies on accounting for longlived assets 

goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 142 the company applies a fair valuebased impairment test to the book value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets on an annual basis and if certain events or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred on an interim basis an impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on the companys financial position and results of operations in the period of recognition the company performed its annual 

impairment test for its goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets as of october 1 2007 and 2006 these tests did not indicate any material impairment of these assets 

upon the implementation of freshstart reporting see note 1 voluntary reorganization under chapter 11—freshstart reporting in the combined notes to consolidated financial statements  the companys assets liabilities and equity were valued at their respective fair values the excess of reorganization value over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities was recorded as goodwill in the accompanying statements of consolidated financial position on the effective date as discussed in note 10 segment information in the combined notes to consolidated financial statements  the entire goodwill amount of 23 billion and 27 billion at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively has been allocated to the mainline reporting segment in addition the adoption of freshstart reporting resulted in the recognition of 22 billion of indefinitelived intangible assets 

sfas 142 requires that a twostep impairment test be performed on goodwill in the first step the company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit goodwill is not impaired and the company is not required to perform further testing if the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit then the company must perform the second step to determine the implied fair value of the goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the goodwill if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then the company must record an impairment charge equal to such difference 

the company assessed the fair value of its reporting units considering both the market and income approaches fair value is estimated under each approach and a weightedaverage fair value is determined by applying an equal weighting to both approaches the market approach utilizes quoted market prices adjusted for control premium and other factors and recent transaction values of peer companies to estimate fair value under the income approach the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows the income approach is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of future capacity passenger yield traffic operating costs appropriate discount rates and other relevant factors to estimate the fair value of indefinitelived intangible assets the company used the market and income approaches discussed above and the cost method which uses the concept of replacement cost as an indicator of fair value 

at december 31 2007 and 2006 united recorded an indefinitelived intangible asset of 255 million for its london heathrow slots based upon its estimation of the fair value for those slots as of the adoption of freshstart reporting on february 1 2006 united however determined at freshstart that its rights relating to its actual route authorities to heathrow had a fair value of zero the euus open skies agreement is expected to directly impact the future value and expected lives of route authorities to heathrow however there is no direct impact from the open skies agreement on airport slot rights including those at heathrow the open skies agreement is also expected to provide united an opportunity to secure antitrust immunity for certain of its star alliance carrier relationships and to provide united and other carriers with access to new markets in eu countries in september 2007 the dot granted united and bmi antitrust immunity the immunity goes into effect at the same time as the open skies agreement between the us and the eu in march of 2008 because of the diverse nature of these potential impacts on uniteds business the overall future impact of the eu agreement on uniteds business in the eu region cannot be predicted with certainty united has concluded that in certain circumstances the open skies agreement could indirectly and adversely affect the fair value of its slot rights at heathrow and therefore has further concluded that the signing of the open skies agreement on april 30 2007 constituted an indicator of impairment with respect to uniteds heathrow slots intangible asset 

in addition to the impairment tests discussed above during the second quarter of 2007 united performed an impairment review of the heathrow slots intangible asset and concluded that no impairment was indicated furthermore no change was determined to be required to the freshstart assignment of an indefinite life to this intangible asset this interim test was performed due to a potential impairment indicator as discussed above 

the implementation of the euus open skies agreement however may result in a future determination that the heathrow slots are impaired in whole or in part or in a future determination that they should be reclassified as definitelived intangible assets with amortization expense recognized thereon such future determination could result in material charges to earnings in those future periods 

other postretirement benefit accounting the company accounts for other postretirement benefits using statement of financial accounting standards no 106 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas 106 and statement of financial accounting standards no 158 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans—an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r sfas 158 for the year ended december 31 2006 the company adopted sfas 158 which requires the company to recognize the difference between plan assets and obligations or the plans funded status in its statements of consolidated financial position  under these accounting standards other postretirement benefit expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods and is generally calculated independently of funding decisions or requirements the company has not been required to prefund its current and future plan obligations which had resulted in a significant net obligation as discussed below 

the fair value of plan assets at december 31 2007 and 2006 was 56 million and 54 million respectively for the other postretirement benefit plans the benefit obligation was 20 billion and 21 billion for the other postretirement benefit plans at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively the difference between the plan assets and obligations has been recorded in the statements of consolidated financial position  detailed information regarding the companys other postretirement plans including key assumptions is included in note 9 retirement and postretirement plans in the combined notes to consolidated financial statements  

the following provides a summary of the methodology used to determine the assumptions disclosed in note 9 retirement and postretirement plans in the combined notes to consolidated financial statements  the calculation of other postretirement benefit expense and obligations requires the use of a number of assumptions including the assumed discount rate for measuring future payment obligations and the expected return on plan assets the discount rates were based on the construction of theoretical bond portfolios adjusted according to the timing of expected cash flows for the companys future postretirement obligations a yield curve was developed based on a subset of these bonds those with yields between the 40th and 90th percentiles the projected cash flows were matched to this yield curve and a present value developed which was then calibrated to develop a single equivalent discount rate 

actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions under the applicable accounting standards those gains and losses are not required to be recognized currently as other postretirement expense but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized into expense over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees the companys accounting policy is to not apply the corridor approach available under sfas 106 with respect to amortization of amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income under the corridor approach amortization of any gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income is only required if at the beginning of the year the accumulated gain or loss exceeds 10 of the greater of the benefit obligation or the fair value of assets if amortization is required the minimum amount outside the corridor divided by the average remaining service period of active employees is recognized as expense the corridor approach is 

intended to reduce volatility of amounts recorded in pension expense each year since the company has elected not to apply the corridor approach all gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are amortized and included in pension expense each year at december 31 2007 and 2006 the company had unrecognized actuarial gains of 254 million and 120 million respectively recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income for its other postretirement benefit plans 

valuation allowance for deferred tax assets at december 31 2007 united and ual each had valuation allowances against their deferred tax assets of approximately 18 billion in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 109 accounting for income taxes  a valuation allowance is required to be recorded when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized future realization depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carry forward period available under the tax law sources of future taxable income include future reversals of taxable temporary differences future taxable income exclusive of reversing taxable differences taxable income in carry back years and tax planning strategies these sources of positive evidence of realizability must be weighed against negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years a recent history of losses would make difficult a determination that a valuation allowance is not needed 

in forming a judgment about the future realization of our deferred tax assets management considered both the positive and negative evidence of realizability and gave significant weight to the negative evidence from our cumulative losses for recent years management will continue to assess this situation and make appropriate adjustments to the valuation allowance based on its evaluation of the positive and negative evidence existing at that time we are currently unable to forecast when there will be sufficient positive evidence for us to reverse the remainder of the valuation allowances that we have recorded currently any reversals of valuation allowance would first reduce goodwill and then reduce intangible assets see note 2p summary of significant accounting policies—new accounting pronouncements for information regarding the effect of changes to this method of accounting for valuation allowance reversals if any on the companys results of operations and financial condition after it is required to adopt sfas 141r on january 1 2009 see note 6 income taxes in the combined notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks uniteds exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to its debt obligations and shortterm investments the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio uniteds policy is to manage interest rate risk through a combination of fixed and variable rate debt and by entering into swap agreements depending upon market conditions a portion of uniteds aircraft lease obligations 497 million in equivalent us dollars at december 31 2007 is denominated in foreign currencies that expose the company to risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates to hedge against some of this risk united has placed foreign currency deposits primarily for euros to meet foreign currency lease obligations denominated in those respective currencies since unrealized marktomarket gains or losses on the foreign currency deposits are offset by the losses or gains on the foreign currency obligations united has hedged its overall exposure to foreign currency exchange rate volatility with respect to its foreign lease deposits and obligations the fair value of these deposits is determined based on the present value of future cash flows using an appropriate swap rate the fair value of longterm debt is predominantly based on the present value of future cash flows using a us treasury rate that matches the remaining life of the instrument adjusted by a credit spread and to a lesser extent on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues the table below presents information as of december 31 2007 about certain of the companys financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest and exchange rates amounts shown below are the same for both ual and united except as noted 

 a amounts also represent united except that uniteds carrying value and fair value of variable rate debt is approximately 3 million lower than the reported ual amounts and uniteds cash equivalents and shortterm investments are approximately 56 million lower than the reported ual amounts 63 

in addition to the cash equivalents and shortterm investments included in the table above ual and united have 325 million and 291 million of shortterm restricted cash respectively and each has 431 million of longterm restricted cash as discussed in note 2e summary of significant accounting policies—cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments and restricted cash in the combined notes to consolidated financial statements  this cash is being held in restricted accounts for workers compensation obligations security deposits for airport leases and reserves with institutions that process uniteds credit card ticket sales due to the short term nature of these cash balances the carrying values approximate the fair values the companys interest income is exposed to changes in interest rates on these cash balances during 2007 the company also repurchased certain of its own debt instruments which remain outstanding at december 31 2007 with a fair value and carrying value of 91 million the company recognizes changes in fair value of these securities through other comprehensive income however on a net basis the company is not exposed to market risk due to offsetting changes in the fair value of the companys debt obligations 

price risk aircraft fuel united enters into fuel option contracts and futures contracts to reduce its price risk exposure to jet fuel these contracts are designed to provide protection against sharp increases in the price of aircraft fuel the company may update its hedging strategy in response to changes in market conditions the fair value of the companys fuel related derivatives was 20 million at december 31 2007 these instruments have a maturity of less than one year 

foreign currency united generates revenues and incurs expenses in numerous foreign currencies such expenses include fuel aircraft leases commissions catering personnel expense advertising and distribution costs customer service expenses and aircraft maintenance changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the companys results of operations through changes in the dollar value of foreign currencydenominated operating revenues and expenses 

despite the adverse effects a strengthening foreign currency may have on demand for usoriginating traffic a strengthening of foreign currencies tends to increase reported revenue and operating income because the companys foreign currencydenominated operating revenue generally exceeds its foreign currencydenominated operating expense for each currency likewise despite the favorable effects a weakening foreign currency may have on demand for usoriginating traffic a weakening of foreign currencies tends to decrease reported revenue and operating income 

the companys most significant net foreign currency exposures in 2007 based on exchange rates in effect at december 31 2007 are presented in the table below 



in 2007 the company began using foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of december 31 2007 the company hedged a portion of its expected foreign currency cash flows in the australian dollar canadian dollar british pound european euro and japanese yen as of december 31 2007 the notional amount of these foreign currencies hedged with the forward contracts in us dollars terms was approximately 346 million these contracts had a fair value of 1 million at december 31 2007 and expire at various dates through december 2008 the company did not have any outstanding foreign currency derivatives at december 31 2006

significant matters remaining to be resolved in chapter 11 cases the following matters remain to be resolved in the bankruptcy court or another court see claims resolution process  below for details of special items recognized in the statements of consolidated operati ons for these matters 

a sfo municipal bond secured interest hsbc bank inc hsbc as trustee for the 1997 municipal bonds related to san francisco international airport sfo filed a complaint against united asserting a security interest in uniteds leasehold for portions of its maintenance base at sfo pursuant to section 506a of the bankruptcy code hsbc alleges that it is entitled to be paid the value of that security interest which hsbc had claimed was as much as 257 million hsbc and united went to trial in april 2006 and the bankruptcy court rejected as a matter of law hsbcs 257 million claim hsbc subsequently alleged that it was entitled to 154 million or at a minimum approximately 93 million the parties tried the case and filed posttrial briefs which were heard by the bankruptcy court in october 2006 the bankruptcy court issued its written opinion holding that the value of the security interest is approximately 27 million united has accrued this amount as its estimated obligation at december 31 2007 after the bankruptcy court denied various posttrial motions both parties have appealed to the district court and those appeals are pending b lax municipal bond secured interest there is pending litigation before the bankruptcy court regarding the extent to which the los angeles international airport lax municipal bond debt is entitled to secured status under section 506a of the bankruptcy code at december 31 2006 united had accrued 60 million for this matter trial on this matter occurred during april 2007 and the two parties filed posttrial briefs in the second quarter of 2007 in august 2007 the bankruptcy court issued its written opinion holding that the value of the security interest is approximately 33 million which united has accrued at december 31 2007 both parties have appealed to the district court and those appeals are pending claims resolution process as permitted under the bankruptcy process the debtors creditors filed proofs of claim with the bankruptcy court through the claims resolution process the company identified many claims which were disallowed by the bankruptcy court for a number of reasons such as claims that were duplicative amended or superseded by later filed claims were without merit or were otherwise overstated throughout the chapter 11 proceedings the company resolved many claims

through settlement or objections ordered by the bankruptcy court the company will continue to settle claims and file additional objections with the bankruptcy court 

with respect to unsecured claims once a claim is deemed to be valid either through the bankruptcy court process or through other means the claimant is entitled to a distribution of common stock in successor ual pursuant to the terms of the plan of reorganization 115 million shares of common stock in successor ual have been authorized to be issued to satisfy valid unsecured claims the bankruptcy court confirmed the plan of reorganization and established january 20 2006 as the record date for purposes of establishing the persons that are claimholders of record to receive distributions approximately 1122 million common shares have been issued and distributed to holders of valid unsecured claims between february 2 2006 the first distribution date established in the plan of reorganization and december 31 2007 as of december 31 2007 approximately 46000 valid unsecured claims aggregating to approximately 292 billion in claim value had received those common shares to satisfy those claims there are 2802797 remaining shares of ual common stock held in reserve to satisfy all of the remaining disputed and undisputed unsecured claim values once the remaining claim disputes are resolved the final distributions of shares will not occur until 2008 or later pending resolution of bankruptcy matters 

the companys current estimate of the probable range of unsecured claims to be allowed by the bankruptcy court is between 293 billion and 296 billion differences between claim amounts filed and the companys estimates continue to be investigated and will be resolved in connection with the claims resolution process however there will be no further financial impact to the company associated with the settlement of such unsecured claims as the holders of all allowed unsecured claims will receive under the plan of reorganization no more than their pro rata share of the distribution of the 115 million shares of common stock of successor ual together with the previouslyagreed issuance of certain securities 

with respect to valid administrative and priority claims pursuant to the terms of the plan of reorganization these claims will be satisfied with cash many asserted administrative and priority claims still remain unpaid and the company will continue to settle claims and file objections with the bankruptcy court to eliminate or reduce such claims in addition certain disputes the most significant of which are discussed in  significant matters remaining to be resolved in chapter 11 cases  above still remain with respect to the valuation of certain claims the company accrued an obligation for claims it believed were reasonably estimable and probable at the effective date however the claims resolution process is uncertain and adjustments to claims estimates could result in material adjustments to the successor companys financial statements in future periods as a result of court rulings the receipt of new or revised information or the finalization of these matters 

the table below includes activity related to the administrative and priority claims and other bankruptcyrelated claim reserves including reserves related to legal professional and tax matters among others for the successor company for the twelve and eleven months ended december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively these reserves are primarily classified in other current liabilities in the statements of consolidated financial position  certain of the accrual adjustments identified below are a direct result of the companys ongoing efforts to resolve certain bankruptcy preconfirmation

 a this amount relates to accruals that are still recognized in the companys statements of consolidated financial position  however these accruals are now deemed to be no longer directly related to bankruptcy proceedings therefore the accruals are no longer classified as part of bankruptcy administrative and priority claims b in the third quarter of 2007 the company recorded a change in estimate for certain liabilities relating to bankruptcy administrative claims this adjustment resulted directly from the progression of the companys ongoing efforts to resolve certain bankruptcy preconfirmation contingencies therefore it was classified as a special operating revenue credit of 45 million that relates to both mainline passenger revenues 37 million and united express revenues 8 million c the company separately recorded a 26 million benefit from a change in estimate to certain other contingent liabilities based largely on changes in underlying facts and circumstances occurring during the third quarter this benefit was recorded as a credit to mainline passenger revenues of 22 million and to regional affiliate revenues of 4 million d the 2007 amount relates to special operating expense credits of 30 million relating to ongoing litigation for san francisco and los angeles facility lease secured interests as discussed above for 2006 the 36 million benefit consists of a 12 million net benefit related to sfo and lax lease litigation and a 24 million benefit related to pension matters as discussed in note 20 special items e this amount relates to accrual adjustments impacting various operating expense line items that the company recorded due to a change in estimate for certain liabilities relating to bankruptcy administrative claims these adjustments resulted directly from the progression of the companys ongoing efforts to resolve certain bankruptcy preconfirmation contingencies f this amount relates to an accrual adjustment that the company recorded due to a change in estimate for certain liabilities relating to bankruptcy administrative claims this adjustment which was recorded as a credit to other operating expense resulted directly from the progression of the companys ongoing efforts to resolve certain bankruptcy preconfirmation contingencies 82

 c use of estimates— the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ from those estimates 

under freshstart reporting the companys asset values were remeasured using fair value which was allocated using the purchase method of accounting in conformity with sfas 141 in addition freshstart reporting also requires that all liabilities other than deferred taxes should be stated at fair value or at the present values of the amounts to be paid using appropriate market interest rates deferred taxes are determined in conformity with sfas 109 

estimates of the fair value of assets and liabilities were determined based on the companys best estimates as discussed in note 1 voluntary reorganization under chapter 11—freshstart reporting above the company also estimates fair value of its financial instruments and its reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets for testing impairment of indefinitelived intangible assets including goodwill these estimates and assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies beyond the control of the company accordingly the company cannot provide assurance that the estimates assumptions and values reflected in the valuations will be realized and actual results could vary materially

intended flight unless the date is extended by notification from the customer on or before the intended flight date fees charged in association with changes or extensions to nonrefundable tickets are recorded as passenger revenue at the time the fee is incurred change fees related to nonrefundable tickets are considered a separate transaction from the air transportation because they represent a charge for the companys additional service to modify a previous order therefore the pricing of the change fee and the initial customer order are separately determined and represent distinct earnings processes refundable tickets expire after one year 

mcos can be either exchanged for a passenger ticket or refunded after issuance united also records an estimate of mcos that will not be exchanged or refunded as revenue ratably over the validity period based on historical results 

united records an estimate of tickets that have been used but not recorded as revenue due to system processing errors as revenue in the month of sale based on historical results due to complex industry pricing structures refund and exchange policies and interline agreements with other airlines certain amounts are recognized as revenue using estimates both as to the timing of recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized these estimates are based on the evaluation of actual historical results united recognizes cargo and mail revenue as service is provided

to owned operating property and equipment at cost when acquired property under capital leases and the related obligation for future lease payments is recorded at an amount equal to the initial present value of those lease payments 

depreciation and amortization of owned depreciable assets is based on the straightline method over the assets estimated service lives leasehold improvements are amortized over the remaining term of the lease including estimated facility renewal options when renewal is reasonably assured at key airports or the estimated service life of the related asset whichever is less aircraft are depreciated to estimated salvage values generally over lives of 27 to 30 years buildings are depreciated over lives of 25 to 45 years and other property and equipment are depreciated over lives of 4 to 15 years 

properties under capital leases are amortized on the straightline method over the life of the lease or in the case of certain aircraft over their estimated service lives lease terms are 5 to 17 years for aircraft and 40 years for buildings amortization of capital leases is included in depreciation and amortization expense

 h mileage plus awards— as a result of the adoption of freshstart reporting the mileage plus frequent flyer obligation was revalued at the effective date to reflect the estimated fair value of miles to be redeemed in the future outstanding miles earned by flying united or its partner carriers were revalued using a weightedaverage permile equivalent ticket value taking into account such factors as historical redemption patterns differing classes of service and domestic and international ticket itineraries which can be reflected in awards chosen by mileage plus members 

the successor company also elected to change its accounting policy as of the effective date from an incremental cost basis to a deferred revenue model to measure its obligation for miles to be redeemed based upon the equivalent ticket value of similar fares on united or amounts paid to star alliance partners as applicable effective december 31 2007 uniteds policy for customer accounts which are inactive for a period of 18 consecutive months is to cancel all miles contained in those accounts at the end of the 18 month period of inactivity the company recognizes revenue from the expiration of miles in such deactivated accounts by amortizing such expiration over the 18 month expiration period 

prior to december 31 2007 the expiration period was 36 months and revenue from expiration was amortized over the 36 month expiration period this change in the expiration period provided a benefit to uniteds operating revenues of 246 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the pretax diluted per share benefit to ual was approximately 160 for the year ended december 31 2007 additional future changes to program rules and program redemption opportunities can significantly alter customer behavior from historical patterns which may result in material changes to the deferred revenue balance as well as passenger revenues

united express operating revenues and expenses are classified as passenger—regional affiliates and regional affiliates respectively in the statements of consolidated operations  the latter includes both allocated and direct costs direct costs represent expenses that are specifically and exclusively related to united express flying activities such as capacity agreement payments commissions booking fees fuel expenses and dedicated staffing the capacity agreement payments are based on specific rates for various operating expenses of the united express carriers such as crew expenses maintenance and aircraft ownership some of which are multiplied by specific operating statistics eg block hours departures while others are fixed per month allocated costs represent united expresss portion of shared expenses and include charges for items such as airport operating costs reservationrelated costs credit card discount fees and facility rents for each of these expense categories the company estimates united expresss portion of total expense and allocates the applicable portion of expense to the united express carrier 

united has the right to exclusively operate and direct the operations of these aircraft and accordingly the minimum future lease payments for these aircraft are included in the companys lease obligations see note 10 segment information and note 16 lease obligations for additional information related to united express 

the company recognizes revenue as flown on a net basis for flights on united express covered by prorate agreements

in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 142 the company applies a fair valuebased impairment test to the net book value of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets on an annual basis as of october 1 or on an interim basis whenever a triggering event occurs sfas 142 requires that a twostep impairment test be performed on goodwill in the first step the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit goodwill is not impaired and the company is not required to perform further testing if the carrying value of the net assets of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit then the company must perform the second step to determine the implied fair value of the goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the goodwill if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then the company must record an impairment charge equal to such difference 

the company assesses the fair value of its reporting units considering both the market and income approaches under the market approach fair value is based on a comparison of similar publicly traded companies under the income approach fair value is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows the income approach is dependent on a number of assumptions including estimates of future capacity passenger yield traffic operating costs including jet fuel prices appropriate discount rates and other relevant assumptions

5 sharebased compensation plans continued 

the following table provides additional information for options granted in each period 



the fair value of options was determined at the grant date using a blackscholes option pricing model which requires the company to make several assumptions the riskfree interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect for the expected term of the option at the time of grant the dividend yield on uals common stock was assumed to be zero since ual did not have any plans to pay dividends at the time of the option grants 

the volatility assumptions were based upon historical volatilities of comparable airlines whose shares are traded using daily stock price returns equivalent to the contractual term of the option since the new ual common stock only began trading in february 2006 the historical volatility data for ual was not considered adequate to determine expected volatility the company did consider implied volatility data for both ual and comparable airlines using current exchangetraded options 

the expected life of the options was determined based upon a simplified assumption that the option will be exercised evenly from vesting to expiration under the transitional guidance of staff accounting bulletin no 107 topic 14 sharebased payments  the stock options typically vest over a four year period except for awards to retirementeligible employees which are considered vested at the grant date 

under sfas 123r the fair value of the restricted stock awards was based upon the volume weightedaverage share price on the date of grant these awards generally vest over four years however if an employee is retirement eligible at the grant date the award is immediately vested in addition if an employee will become retirement eligible within four years of the grant date the award will vest over the remaining period to retirement eligibility approximately 17 million of the 20 million nonvested restricted stock awards at december 31 2007 are expected to vest

6 income taxes 

united and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return with ual under an intercompany tax allocation policy united and its subsidiaries compute record and pay ual for their own tax liability as if they were separate companies filing separate returns in determining their own tax liabilities united and each of its subsidiaries take into account all tax credits or benefits generated and utilized as separate companies and they are compensated for the aforementioned tax benefits only if they would be able to use those benefits on a separate company basis 

in 2007 the companys current regular taxable income was completely absorbed by utilization of its net operating loss nol carry forward however it did incur an alternative minimum tax amt liability of 6 million as indicated in the table below in 2006 and 2005 the company incurred both a regular tax loss and an amt loss

  temporary differences and carry forwards that give rise to a significant portion of deferred tax assets and liabilities at december 31 2007 and 2006 were as follows 

 the federal and state nol carry forwards relate to prior years nols which may be carried forward to reduce the tax liabilities of future years this tax benefit is mostly attributable to federal pretax nol carry forwards of 66 billion if not utilized the federal tax benefits of 10 billion expire

in 2022 04 billion expire in 2023 05 billion expire in 2024 and 04 billion expire in 2025 in addition the state tax benefit of 156 million if not utilized expires over a five to twenty year period 

at this time the company does not believe that the limitations imposed by the internal revenue code on the usage of the nol carry forward and other tax attributes following an ownership change will have an effect on the company therefore the company does not believe its exit from bankruptcy has had any material impact on the utilization of its remaining nol carry forward and other tax attributes 

the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income including the reversals of deferred tax liabilities during the periods in which those temporary differences will become deductible the companys management assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets and records a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized as a result the company has a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets as of december 31 2007 and 2006 to reflect managements assessment regarding the realizability of those assets the company expects to continue to maintain a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets until other positive evidence is sufficient the current valuation allowance of 1815 million and 1757 million for ual and united respectively if reversed in 2008 will be allocated to reduce goodwill and then other intangible assets if reversed in 2009 or later it will be allocated to reduce income tax expense as discussed in note 2p summary of significant accounting policies—new accounting pronouncements 

in addition to the deferred tax assets listed above the company has an 801 million unrecorded tax benefit at december 31 2007 attributable to the difference between the amount of the financial statement expense and the allowable tax deduction for ual common stock issued to certain unsecured creditors and employees pursuant to the plan of reorganization the company is accounting for this unrecorded tax benefit by analogy to sfas 123r which requires recognition of the tax benefit to be deferred until it is realized as a reduction of taxes payable 

effective january 1 2007 we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 48 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 48 our adoption of fin 48 resulted in a 24 million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits utb which was accounted for as a 6 million decrease in goodwill a 2 million increase in additional capital invested and a 32 million increase to deferred tax assets 

at december 31 2007 our liability for uncertain tax positions was 35 million utb of 19 million would affect our effective tax rate if recognized excluding amounts related to tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain there were no significant changes in the components of the liability in the twelve months ending december 31 2007 any change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months is not expected to result in a significant impact on the results of operations or the financial position of the company 

included in the balance at december 31 2007 is 16 million of tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility because of the impact of deferred tax accounting other than interest and penalties the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not affect the effective tax rate but would cause a reduction to the net operating losses available for utilization 

we record penalties and interest relating to uncertain tax positions in the other operating expense and interest expense line items respectively within our consolidated statement of income

the following table presents information about the intangible assets of the successor and predecessor companies including goodwill at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively 

 the company initially recorded goodwill of 2756 million upon its exit from bankruptcy during the year ended december 31 2007 goodwill decreased by 423 million due to a 414 million reduction of the valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets established at freshstart 6 million due to the adoption of fin 48 and 3 million due to a change in estimate of tax accruals existing at the effective date during the eleven month period ended december 31 2006 goodwill was decreased by 62 million due to successor company tax activity that impacted the deferred tax asset valuation allowance and increased by 9 million due to net adjustments to the fair values of certain assets and liabilities total amortization expense recognized was 155 million for the year ended december 31 2007 1 million for the one month period ended january 31 2006 and 169 million for the eleven month period ended december 31 2006 the company expects to record amortization expense of 92 million 70 million 64 million 59 million and 56 million for 2008 2009 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively 

open skies on april 30 2007 the us government and the european union eu signed a transatlantic aviation agreement to replace the existing bilateral arrangements between the us government and the 27 eu member states the agreement is expected to become effective at the end of march 2008

united states and london heathrow thereby potentially adding new competition to uniteds heathrow operation although heathrow is currently subject to both slot and facility constraints which may practically limit the extent of new competition in the near term this agreement does not provide for a reallocation of existing slots among carriers 

at december 31 2007 and 2006 united recorded an indefinitelived intangible asset of 255 million for its london heathrow slots based upon its estimation of the fair value for those slots as of the adoption of freshstart reporting on february 1 2006 united however determined at freshstart that its rights relating to its actual route authorities to heathrow had a fair value of zero the euus open skies agreement is expected to directly impact the future value and expected lives of route authorities to heathrow however there is no direct impact from the open skies agreement on airport slot rights including those at heathrow the open skies agreement is also expected to provide united an opportunity to secure antitrust immunity for certain of its star alliance carrier relationships and to provide united and other carriers with access to new markets in eu countries in september 2007 the dot granted united and bmi antitrust immunity the immunity goes into effect at the same time as the open skies agreement between the us and the eu in march of 2008 because of the diverse nature of these potential impacts on uniteds business the overall future impact of the eu agreement on uniteds business in the eu region cannot be predicted with certainty united has concluded that in certain circumstances the open skies agreement could indirectly and adversely affect the fair value of its slot rights at heathrow and therefore has further concluded that the signing of the open skies agreement on april 30 2007 constituted an indicator of impairment with respect to uniteds heathrow slots intangible asset 

united performed annual impairment reviews of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of october 1 2007 and 2006 and determined that no impairment was indicated in addition a 2007 interim impairment review was performed for the heathrow slots intangible asset and the company concluded that no impairment was then indicated and that no change was then required to the freshstart assignment of an indefinite life to the heathrow slots

hedged to the extent that the designated cash flow hedges are ineffective gain or loss is recognized currently in earnings the company offsets the fair value of derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty when netting agreements exist 

instruments classified as economic hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas 133 under this classification all changes in the fair value of these contracts are recorded currently in income with the offset to either current assets or liabilities each reporting period economic fuel hedge gains and losses are classified as part of aircraft fuel expense and foreign currency hedge gains and losses are classified as part of nonoperating income 

aircraft fuel hedges 

the company has a risk management strategy to hedge a portion of its price risk related to projected jet fuel requirements primarily through collar options the collars involve the purchase of fuel call options with the simultaneous sale of fuel put options with identical expiration dates in the year ended december 31 2007 and the eleven months ended december 31 2006 the successor company entered into and settled various derivative positions for its mainline operations that were classified as economic hedges 

in the year ended december 31 2007 the companys mainline fuel expense included income of 83 million from net gains on economic hedges the net hedge gains recorded in 2007 included 20 million of unrealized marktomarket gains for contracts settling after december 31 2007 in the eleven months ended december 31 2006 the successor company recognized a net loss of 26 million which included a 24 million realized loss on settled contracts and 2 million of unrealized marktomarket losses for contracts settling after december 31 2006 all of which were classified as mainline fuel expense in the statements of consolidated operations  in 2005 the predecessor company recognized income of 40 million in nonoperating income primarily due to nondesignated hedges 

as of december 31 2007 the company had hedged 13 of forecasted first quarter 2008 fuel consumption of which 82 is through threeway collars with upside protection on a weightedaverage basis beginning from 90 per barrel and capped at 100 per barrel with payment obligations on a weightedaverage basis beginning if crude oil drops below 85 per barrel the remaining 18 is hedged through collars with upside protection beginning on a weightedaverage basis at a crude oil equivalent price of 101 per barrel with payment obligations on a weighted average basis beginning if crude oil drops below 91 per barrel

february 2006 the successor company entered into an interest rate swap with an initial notional amount of 245 billion that would have decreased to 18 billion over the term of the swap the swap would have expired in february 2012 and required that the company pay a fixed rate of 514 and receive a floating rate based on the threemonth libor rate 

the company initially applied hedge accounting for the swap but subsequently discontinued hedge accounting in 2006 as the company determined that it was no longer probable that a portion of the forecasted cash flows hedged by the swap would occur in light of the companys developing plans to retire a portion of the credit facility in advance of scheduled maturities any gains and losses related to interest rate swap agreements if any that are included in earnings are classified as interest expense in january 2007 the company terminated the interest rate swap that had been used to hedge the future interest payments under the original credit facility

fair value of financial instruments 

the following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which such estimates can be made 

cash and cash equivalents restricted cash and shortterm investments 

the carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the shortterm maturity of these investments 

derivative financial instruments 

market prices used to determine fair value fuelrelated and foreign currency derivatives are primarily based on prices obtained from counterparties or brokerdealers 

preferred stock and longterm debt 

the fair value is based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues discounted cash flow models using appropriate market rates and the blackscholes model to value conversion rights in uals convertible preferred stock and debt instruments 

the following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the companys financial instruments at december 31 2007 and 2006 amounts shown below are applicable to both ual and united except that longterm debt is presented on a ual consolidated basis which is approximately 3 million and 4 million higher than both the carrying value and fair value of uniteds

 15 commitments contingent liabilities and uncertainties 

general guarantees and indemnifications in the normal course of business the company enters into numerous real estate leasing and aircraft financing arrangements that have various guarantees included in the contracts these guarantees are primarily in the form of indemnities in both leasing and financing transactions the company typically indemnifies the lessors and any taxfinancing parties against tort liabilities that arise out of the use occupancy operation or maintenance of the leased premises or financed aircraft currently the company believes that any future payments required under these guarantees or indemnities would be immaterial as most tort liabilities and related indemnities are covered by insurance subject to deductibles additionally certain leased premises such as fueling stations or storage facilities include indemnities of such parties for any environmental liability that may arise out of or relate to the use of the leased premises 

legal and environmental contingencies the company has certain contingencies resulting from litigation and claims including environmental issues incident to the ordinary course of business management believes after considering a number of factors including but not limited to the information currently available the views of legal counsel the nature of contingencies to which the company is subject and prior experience that the ultimate disposition of these contingencies will not materially affect the companys consolidated financial position or results of operations 

the company records liabilities for legal and environmental claims when a loss is probable and reasonably estimatable these amounts are recorded based on the companys assessments of the likelihood of their eventual disposition the amounts of these liabilities could increase or decrease in the near term based on revisions to estimates relating to the various claims 

the company anticipates that if ultimately found liable its damages from claims arising from the events of september 11 2001 could be significant however the company believes that under the air transportation safety and system stabilization act of 2001 its liability will be limited to its insurance coverage 

the company is also currently analyzing whether any potential liability may result from air cargopassenger surcharge cartel investigations following the receipt of a statement of objections that the european commission the commission issued to 26 carriers on december 18 2007 the statement of objections sets out evidence related to the utilization of fuel and security surcharges and exchange of pricing information that the commission views as supporting the conclusion that an illegal price

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

to the board of directors and stockholders of ual corporation chicago illinois 

we have audited the internal control over financial reporting of ual corporation and subsidiaries the company as of december 31 2007 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management report on internal control over financial reporting in item 9a our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the companys principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the companys board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2007 based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended december 31 2007 of the company and our report dated february 27 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule

forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 as amended and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended forwardlooking statements

uncertainties factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those referenced in the forwardlooking statements are listed in the last paragraph of outlook in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we disclaim any intent or obligation to update or revise any of the forwardlooking statements whether in response to new information unforeseen events changed circumstances or otherwise bankruptcy considerations   the following discussion provides general background information regarding our chapter 11 cases and is not intended to be an exhaustive summary detailed information pertaining to our bankruptcy filings may be obtained through the website wwwpdualcom    on december 9 2002 petition date ual united and 26 direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions to reorganize their businesses under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of illinois eastern division the bankruptcy court the bankruptcy court is jointly administering these cases as in re ual corporation et al case no 02b48191   as required by the bankruptcy code the united states trustee for the northern district of illinois appointed on december 13 2002 an official committee of unsecured creditors the creditors committee the creditors committee and its legal representatives have a right to be heard on all matters that come before the bankruptcy court concerning our reorganization there can be no assurance that the creditors committee will support our positions or our plan of reorganization and any disagreements between the creditors committee and us could protract the chapter 11 process hinder our ability to operate during the chapter 11 process and delay our emergence from chapter 11   with the exception of our nonfiling subsidiaries we continue to operate our businesses as debtorsinpossession under the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the bankruptcy code the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure and applicable court orders in general as debtorsinpossession we are authorized under chapter 11 to continue to operate as an ongoing business but may not engage in transactions outside the ordinary course of business without the prior approval of the bankruptcy court   all vendors are being paid for all goods furnished and services provided after the petition date in the ordinary course of business however under section 362 of the bankruptcy code actions to collect most of our prepetition liabilities are automatically stayed among other things except for liabilities relating to certain qualifying aircraft aircraft engines and other aircraftrelated equipment that are leased or subject to a security interest or conditional sale contract under section 1110 of the bankruptcy code actions to collect such aircraftrelated prepetition liabilities are automatically stayed for 60 days after the petition date the stay of such actions in our case ended on february 7 2003 except under two conditions a the debtor may extend the 60day period by agreement with the relevant financier and with court approval or b the debtor may agree to perform all of the obligations under the applicable lease or financing and cure any defaults as required under the bankruptcy code if neither of these conditions is met the lessor or financier may demand the return of the aircraft and enforce any of its contractual rights or remedies to sell lease or otherwise retain or dispose of such property   we have negotiated with our aircraft lessors and lenders to restructure existing financings to reduce aircraft ownership costs to better reflect current market rates and we have reached agreements in principle to restructure transactions with respect to a majority of our financed aircraft however the need for further cost reductions due to difficult changes in the airline industry substantially higher fuel prices and the continuing weak revenue environment has required us to reexamine these agreements and to seek to renegotiate certain of those financings to the extent we are unable to restructure any financings that we believe are unaffordable under our revised business plan we may face the possibility that one or more lessors or lenders may seek to repossess aircraft we also will need to finalize those agreements in principle and to the extent we are unable to do so we may likewise face the possibility of repossessions in either case the loss of a significant number of aircraft could result in a material adverse effect on our financial and operational performance   we are currently in discussions with a large group of mostly publicmarket financiers to renegotiate an agreement in principle for a group of aircraft reached in the summer of 2004 from which we subsequently withdrew due to the need for further cost reductions while we believe we can ultimately reach a mutually acceptable restructuring for the continued use of these aircraft at affordable rates the financiers have demanded the return of certain aircraft and there can be no assurance that these aircraft will be available for our continued use to date repossession of these aircraft has been enjoined by the bankruptcy court but to the extent the bankruptcy court or another court of competent jurisdiction permits the repossession of these or other aircraft our financial and operational performance could be adversely affected   we have also rejected or abandoned certain surplus aircraft to adjust our fleet size and composition to more closely match market demand in addition as part of ongoing negotiations with financiers we have converted many longterm financing arrangements into shortterm operating leases and in several instances reacquired previously rejected aircraft as circumstances warranted   under section 365 of the bankruptcy code we may assume assume and assign or reject certain executory contracts and unexpired leases including leases of real property subject to the approval of the bankruptcy court and certain other conditions by order of the bankruptcy court our section 365 rights to assume assume and assign or reject unexpired leases of nonresidential real estate expire on the earlier of the date of termination of our exclusive period to file a plan of reorganization currently april 30 2005 or the date of the conclusion of a disclosure statement hearing in connection with a proposed plan of reorganization   in general if we reject an executory contract or unexpired lease it is treated as a prepetition breach of the lease or contract in question and subject to certain exceptions relieves us of performing any future obligations however such a rejection entitles the lessor or contract counterparty to a prepetition general unsecured claim for damages caused by such deemed breach and accordingly the counterparty may file a claim against us for such damages as a result liabilities subject to compromise are likely to change in the future as a result of damage claims created by our rejection of various aircraft executory contracts and unexpired leases generally if we assume an aircraft financing agreement executory contract or unexpired lease we are required to cure existing defaults under such contract or lease we expect that the future assumption of certain executory contracts and unexpired leases may convert liabilities currently shown as subject to compromise to liabilities not subject to compromise   since the petition date we have focused on transforming the company to compete effectively in a fundamentally changed and difficult industry for the first nineteen months of the restructuring we worked to emerge from chapter 11 protection with exit financing guaranteed by the air transportation stabilization board the atsb during this time we achieved average annual cash savings from all stakeholders of 5 billion annually including savings from aircraft financiers employees and retirees in addition we made substantial progress in restructuring united by not only achieving a lower labor and nonlabor cost structure but also by delivering superior levels of operating performance and customer satisfaction despite these accomplishments and the concessions made by uniteds stakeholders in june 2004 the atsb denied our application for a federal loan guarantee   following the atsbs final denial it became clear that the additional time needed to restructure further and obtain nonguaranteed exit financing would require us to remain in chapter 11 longer than originally anticipated in an effort to attract nonguaranteed exit financing we undertook a comprehensive reevaluation of our business plan in order to identify all opportunities for further cost savings and revenue improvement as part of this process we worked in conjunction with certain members of and advisors to the creditors committee to analyze key aspects of our business plan and reorganization given the continued harsh business realities currently facing the airline industry we identified approximately 2 billion in additional annual labor and nonlabor cash savings that we believed would be needed to obtain nonguaranteed exit financing the company expects to realize the full 2 billion in cash savings in fiscal year 2007   during the fourth quarter 2004 we advised the bankruptcy court that the systemic changes in the industry and the continued harsh financial environment made termination and replacement of our defined benefit pension plans necessary and that in addition to pension relief our updated business plan would require further average annual labor savings from our union and nonunion employees in november 2004 we commenced the process available to us under section 1113 of the bankruptcy code to modify our collective bargaining agreements cbas in an effort to achieve 725 million in average annual labor savings of the 2 billion target and to eliminate any requirement in our cbas to maintain a defined benefit pension plan for information on labor savings see labor restructuring in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations    to successfully emerge from chapter 11 in addition to obtaining nonguaranteed exit financing the bankruptcy court must confirm a plan of reorganization the filing of which will depend on the timing and outcome of numerous ongoing matters in the chapter 11 process we expect to file a plan of reorganization that provides for uals emergence from bankruptcy later in 2005 but there can be no assurance that the bankruptcy court will confirm a plan of reorganization or that any such plan will be implemented successfully   the reorganization plan will determine the rights and claims of various creditors and security holders at this time it is not possible to predict accurately the effect of the chapter 11 reorganization process on our business nor can we make any predictions concerning how each of these claims will be valued in the bankruptcy proceedings we believe that uals presently outstanding equity securities will have no value and will be canceled under any plan of reorganization that we propose for this reason we urge that caution be exercised with respect to existing and future investments in any ual security operations   segments   we operate our businesses through five reporting segments north america the pacific the atlantic and latin america each of which is operated by united and ual loyalty services inc uls financial information on uals operating segments can be found in note 18 segment information in the notes to consolidated financial statements    during 2004 united carried approximately 71 million mainline revenue passengers and flew approximately 115 billion mainline revenue passenger miles ual operating statistics do not include the operations of united express regional carriers since these entities are independent carriers uniteds network provides comprehensive transportation service within its north american segment and to international destinations within its pacific atlantic and latin american segments   operating revenues attributed to uniteds north america segment were 105

card hotels car rental companies and dining programs uls also owns and operates certain other unitedbranded customer programs as well as the mypointscom online loyalty program under which registered consumers earn points for goods and services purchased from participating vendors   united cargo   united cargo offers both domestic and international shipping through a variety of services including small package delivery td guaranteed first freight international freight and global sp freight accounts for approximately 77 of united cargos shipments with mail accounting for the remaining 23 during 2004 united cargo accounted for 4 of uals revenues by generating 704 million in freight and mail revenue a 12 increase versus 2003 although united cargo is not a separate reporting segment cargo revenues are allocated to the north america pacific atlantic and latin america reporting segments of united the majority of united cargo revenues are earned in the international segments of the companys operations   fuel   fuel is our second largest cost behind labor our fuel costs and consumption for the years 2004 2003 and 2002 are as follows      the price and availability of jet fuel significantly affect our operations a significant rise in crude oil prices was the primary reason for our fuel expense increasing 871 million in 2004 over our 2003 fuel costs due to the highly competitive nature of the airline industry our ability to pass on increased fuel costs to our customers in the form of higher ticket prices has been limited   to ensure adequate supplies of fuel and to provide a measure of control over fuel costs we arrange to have fuel shipped on major pipelines and stored close to our major hub locations although we currently do not anticipate a significant reduction in the availability of jet fuel a number of factors make predicting fuel prices and fuel availability difficult including increased world demand due to the improving global economy geopolitical uncertainties in oilproducing nations threats of terrorism directed at oil supply infrastructure and changes in relative demand for other petroleum products that may impact the quantity and price of jet fuel produced from period to period   insurance   we carry hull and liability insurance of a type customary in the air transportation industry in amounts which we deem adequate covering passenger liability public liability and damage to our aircraft and other physical property since the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks our premiums have increased significantly   after september 11 2001 commercial insurers cancelled our liability insurance for losses resulting from war and associated perils terrorism sabotage hijacking and other similar events but we obtained replacement coverage through the federal government the homeland security act which became effective in february 2003 mandated the federal aviation administration faa to provide thirdparty passenger and hull warrisk insurance to commercial air carriers through august 31 2003 and permitted such coverage to be extended to december 31 2004 the consolidated appropriations act 2005 signed into law on december 8 2004 extends this warrisk insurance coverage to commercial air carriers through august 31 2005 and permits such coverage to be extended until december 31 2005 if the federal government determines that such an extension is in the national interest should the government discontinue this coverage obtaining comparable coverage from commercial underwriters could result in substantially higher premiums and more restrictive terms if it is available at all if we are unable to obtain adequate war risk insurance our business would be materially and adversely affected   also we maintain other types of insurance such as property directors and officers cargo automobile and the like with limits and deductibles that are standard within the industry these premiums have also risen substantially since september 11 2001   alliances   we have entered into a number of bilateral and multilateral alliances with other airlines to provide our customers more travel choices and to participate in markets worldwide that we do not serve directly these collaborative marketing arrangements typically include one or more of the following features joint frequent flyer program participation code sharing of flight operations whereby one carriers flights can be marketed under the twoletter airline designator code of another carrier coordination of reservations baggage handling and flight schedules and other resourcesharing activities   the most significant of these is the star alliance a global integrated airline network cofounded by united in 1997 as of december 31 2004 star alliance carriers served approximately 780 destinations in over 130 countries with over 13000 daily flights current star alliance partners in addition to united are air canada air new zealand all nippon airways asiana the austrian airlines group which includes austrian airlines lauda air and austrian arrows formerly tyrolean bmi lot polish airlines lufthansa sas singapore airways spanair thai international airways us airways and varig mexicana withdrew from the star alliance effective march 31 2004 effective the same day the unitedmexicana code share agreement was terminated   star alliance announced that during 2005 tap air portugal and south african airways will join the alliance as full members and that blue1 owned by sas adria airways slovenias national carrier and croatia airways croatias national carrier will join as regional star alliance members   in addition to these marketing relationships united currently has independent marketing agreements with other air carriers including air china air dolomiti aloha bwia west indies airways continental connection operated by gulfstream fair inc dba ana connection great lakes airlines a regional carrier and virgin blue   mileage plus   our mileage plus frequent flyer program encourages customer loyalty by offering awards and services to frequent travelers there are more than 45 million members enrolled in mileage plus who earn mileage credit for flights on united united express ted the star alliance and certain other airlines that participate in the program miles also can be earned by purchasing the goods and services of our nonairline partners such as hotels car rental companies and credit card issuers mileage credits can be redeemed for free discounted or upgraded travel and nontravel awards for a detailed description of the accounting treatment of mileage plus awards see critical accounting policies in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations    distribution channels   the majority of our airline inventory continues to be distributed through the traditional channels of travel agencies and global distribution systems the growing use of electronic ticket distribution systems including electronic tickets and the internet however provides us with an opportunity to lower our ticket distribution costs to capitalize on these costsaving opportunities we continue to expand the capabilities of our website unitedcom and encourage our customers to make their bookings on unitedcom industry conditions   seasonality   the air travel business is subject to seasonal fluctuations our operations can be adversely impacted by severe weather and our first and fourthquarter results normally reflect reduced travel demand historically results of operations are better in the second and third quarters from 2001 through 2003 however the typical seasonal relationships were distorted by the events of september 11 2001 the fear of terrorism the iraq war fluctuations in fuel prices and general economic conditions the company experienced a more typical seasonal pattern of financial results in 2004   domestic competition   the domestic airline industry is highly competitive and volatile in domestic markets new and existing carriers deemed fit by the department of transportation dot are free to initiate service between any two points in the us our domestic competitors are primarily the other us airlines a number of whom are lowcost carriers lccs with significantly lower cost structures than ours and to a lesser extent other forms of transportation   united faces significantly more domestic competition now than it did in the past this increase is largely attributable to the growth of lccs whose share of domestic passengers is now over 30 percent accordingly about 75 percent of uniteds domestic revenue is now exposed to lccs which is double the percentage from a decade ago we anticipate that competition from lccs and other us airlines will continue to intensify in the future   domestic pricing decisions are largely affected by the need to meet competition from other us airlines fare discounting by competitors has historically had a negative effect on our financial results because we generally find it necessary to match competitors fares to maintain passenger traffic periodic attempts by united and other network airlines to raise fares have often failed due to lack of competitive matching by lccs because of vastly different cost structures lowticket prices that generate a profit for an lcc usually have a negative effect on our financial results the introduction of ted by united in early 2004 is designed to provide united with a lowercost operation in selected leisure markets under which united can be more economically competitive with its lcc rivals   international competition  in our international networks we compete not only with us airlines but also with foreign carriers our competition on specified international routes is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulations see industry regulation below as the us is the largest market for air travel worldwide our ability to generate us originating traffic from our integrated domestic route systems provides us with an advantage over nonus carriers foreign carriers are prohibited by us law from carrying local passengers between two points in the us and we experience comparable restrictions in foreign countries in addition us carriers are often constrained from carrying passengers to points beyond designated international gateway cities due to limitations in air service agreements or restrictions imposed unilaterally by foreign governments to compensate for these structural limitations us and foreign carriers have entered into alliances and marketing arrangements that allow the carriers to feed traffic to each others flights see alliances above industry regulation   domestic regulation   general  all carriers engaged in air transportation in the united states are subject to regulation by the dot among its responsibilities the dot has authority to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity for domestic air transportation no air carrier unless exempted may provide air transportation without a dot certificate of public convenience and necessity grants international route authorities approves international code share agreements regulates methods of competition and enforces certain consumer protection regulations such as those dealing with advertising denied boarding compensation and baggage liability we operate under a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the dot this certificate may be altered amended modified or suspended by the dot if public convenience and necessity so require or may be revoked for intentional failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the certificate   airlines also are regulated by the faa a division of the dot primarily in the areas of flight operations maintenance and other safety and technical matters the faa has authority to issue air carrier operating certificates and aircraft airworthiness certificates prescribe maintenance procedures and regulate pilot and other employee training among other responsibilities from time to time the faa issues rules that require air carriers to take certain actions such as the inspection or modification of aircraft and other equipment that may cause us to incur substantial unplanned expenses we are also subject to inquiries by these and other us and international regulatory bodies we do not believe that any such existing inquiries will have a material affect on our business   the airline industry is also subject to various other federal state and local laws and regulations the department of homeland security has jurisdiction over virtually all aspects of civil aviation security see  legislation  below the department of justice has jurisdiction over certain airline competition matters the us postal service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail labor relations in the airline industry are generally governed by the railway labor act future regulatory and legal compliance developments in the us and abroad could materially and adversely affect operations and increase operating costs for the airline industry including the company   airport access  access to landing and takeoff rights or slots at three major us airports and certain foreign airports served by united are subject to government regulation the faa has designated john f kennedy international airport kennedy and laguardia airport laguardia in new york and ronald reagan washington national airport in washington dc as high density traffic airports and has limited the number of departure and arrival slots at those airports slot restrictions at ohare international airport in chicago ohare were eliminated in july 2002 and are slated to be eliminated at kennedy and laguardia by 2007 from time to time the elimination of slot restrictions has impacted our operational performance and reliability   to address congestion concerns and delays at ohare united and american airlines reached agreements with the faa in january 2004 to reduce each of their flight schedules at ohare we reduced our flight schedule at ohare beginning february 2004 between the peak hours of 100 pm and 800 pm in addition effective march 2004 we again depeaked our flight schedule by 5 subsequently united american airlines and certain other carriers complied with the faas request to further depeak afternoon operations at ohare resulting in a slight reduction in operations overall beginning in november 2004 on february 10 2005 the faa issued an order to show cause why the current operating restrictions at ohare should not remain in place through october 2005 we expect a formal rulemaking process to address ohare congestion to begin later this year   legislation  since september 11 2001 aviation security has been and continues to be a subject of frequent legislative action requiring changes to our security processes and increasing the economic cost of security procedures on the company the aviation and transportation security act the aviation security act enacted in november 2001 has had wideranging effects on our operations the aviation security act made the federal government responsible for virtually all aspects of civil aviation security creating a new transportation security administration tsa which is a part of the department of homeland security pursuant to the homeland security act of 2002 under the aviation security act substantially all security screeners at airports are now federal employees and significant other aspects of airline and airport security are now overseen by the tsa pursuant to the aviation security act funding for airline and airport security is provided in part by a passenger security fee of 250 per flight segment capped at 1000 per round trip which is collected by the air carriers from passengers and remitted to the government in addition air carriers are required to submit to the government an additional security fee equal to the amount the air carrier paid for security screening of passengers and property in 2000 it is expected that aviation security laws and processes will continue to be under review and subject to change by the federal government in the future   international regulation   general  international air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation in connection with our international services we are regulated by both the us government and the governments of the foreign countries we serve in addition the availability of international routes to us carriers is regulated by treaties and related aviation agreements between the us and foreign governments and in some cases fares and schedules require the approval of the dot andor the relevant foreign governments   airport access  historically access to foreign markets has been tightly controlled through bilateral agreements between the us and each foreign country involved these agreements regulate the number of markets served the number of carriers allowed to serve each market and the frequency of carriers flights since the early 1990s the us has pursued a policy of open skies meaning all carriers have access to the destination under which the us government has negotiated a number of bilateral agreements allowing unrestricted access to foreign markets additionally all of the airports that united serves in europe and asia maintain slot controls and many of these are restrictive due to congestion at these airports london heathrow frankfurt and tokyo narita are among the most restrictive due to capacity limitations and united has significant operations at these locations   further our ability to serve some countries and expand into certain others is limited by the absence altogether of aviation agreements between the us and the relevant governments shifts in us or foreign government aviation policies can lead to the alteration or termination of air service agreements between the us and other countries depending on the nature of the change the value of our route authorities may be enhanced or diminished   in june 2004 the united states and the peoples republic of china agreed to implement various amendments to the existing air services agreement providing an opportunity for some new us china air service for us and chinese carriers subsequently united obtained rights to operate seven new frequencies which it is using to operate daily nonstop chicagoshanghai roundtrip service effective october 31 2004   in 2004 the united states and the european commission attempted to negotiate a single air services agreement to replace the existing bilateral agreements between the united states and the european union eu member states the negotiations were not successful and further discussions between the parties are expected in 2005 the european commission has called upon the eu member states to renounce their air services agreements with the united states because they allegedly do not comply with eu law to date no eu member state has indicated a willingness to renounce its air services agreement with the us if eu member states do renounce such agreements the status of our existing antitrust immunity with our european partners would be in doubt because the immunity is based upon an open skies agreement between the united states and the applicable eu member state   in late 2004 the european commission commenced a consultation process that seeks stakeholder input on the introduction of marketbased mechanisms for slot allocation at eu airports the commission proposes to introduce a highly regulated form of secondary slot trading the availability of such slots is not assured and the inability of the company to obtain or retain needed slots could inhibit its efforts to compete in certain international markets   environmental regulation   the airline industry is subject to increasingly stringent federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning emissions to the air discharges to surface and subsurface waters safe drinking water and the management of hazardous substances oils and waste materials our industry is also subject to other environmental laws and regulations including those that require us to remediate soil or groundwater to meet certain objectives it is our policy to comply with all environmental laws and regulations which can require significant expenditures under the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund and similar environmental cleanup laws generators of waste materials and owners or facility operators can be subject to liability for investigation and remediation costs at facilities that have been identified as requiring response actions we also conduct voluntary remediation actions such cleanup obligations can arise from among other circumstances the operation of fueling facilities and primarily involve airport sites future costs associated with these activities are not expected to have a material adverse affect on our business   from time to time we become aware of uniteds potential noncompliance with environmental regulations which have either been identified by the company through our internal environmental compliance auditing program or through notice from a governmental entity in some instances these matters could potentially become the subject of an administrative or judicial proceeding and could potentially involve monetary sanctions we do not expect these matters individually or collectively to have a material adverse affect on our business employees   as of december 31 2004 the company and its subsidiaries had approximately 61000 active employees of whom approximately 80 are represented by various us labor organizations   as of december 31 2004 the employee groups number of employees and labor organization for each of uniteds collective bargaining groups were as follows    1 air line pilots association alpa association of flight attendants  communication workers of america afa aircraft mechanics fraternal association amfa international association of machinists and aerospace workers iam professional airline flight control association pafca transport workers union twu and international federation of professional and technical engineers ifpte 2 amendable dates are as of the filing date of this annual report   collective bargaining agreements are negotiated under the railway labor act which governs labor relations in the transportation industry and such agreements typically do not contain an expiration date instead they specify an amendable date upon which the contract is considered open for amendment prior to the amendable date neither party is required to agree to modifications to the bargaining agreement nevertheless nothing prevents the parties from agreeing to start negotiations or to modify the agreement in advance of the amendable date contracts remain in effect while new agreements are negotiated during the negotiating period both the company and the negotiating union are required to maintain the status quo   for detailed information on labor matters see labor restructuring in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

 item 3 legal proceedings in re ual corporation et al   as discussed above on the petition date the company united and 26 other direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in the bankruptcy court the chapter 11 cases are being jointly administered under the caption in re ual corporation et al case no 02b48191 as debtorsinpossession we are authorized under chapter 11 to continue to operate as an ongoing business but may not engage in transactions outside the ordinary course of business without the prior approval of the bankruptcy court as of the petition date virtually all pending litigation including some of the actions described below is stayed and absent further order of the bankruptcy court no party subject to certain exceptions may take any action to recover on prepetition claims against us in addition we may reject prepetition executory contracts and unexpired lease obligations and parties affected by these rejections may file claims with the bankruptcy court at this time it is not possible to predict the outcome of the chapter 11 process or its effect on our business summers v ual corporation esop et al   the ual corporation employee stock ownership plan esop and the esop committee were sued in the us district court for the northern district of illinois the district court on february 28 2003 by certain esop participants seeking monetary damages in a purported class action that alleges that the esop committee breached its fiduciary duty by not selling ual stock held by the esop commencing as of july 19 2001 the complaint cites numerous events and disclosures that allegedly should have alerted the esop committee to the need to sell the shares the esop committee appointed state street bank and trust company state street in september 2002 to act as fiduciary and state street started selling the shares in september 2002 when the stock was trading between 1 and 5 per share members of the purported class have also filed claims against the company in the chapter 11 proceeding asserting that the company also is liable for the failure to sell the esop shares the company has 10 million in fiduciary insurance in place to cover some portion of any liability and has a prepetition obligation to indemnify the esop committee members beyond that coverage which indemnification obligation may or may not be assumed as part of our plan of reorganization the parties have entered into a stipulation under which the plaintiffs have agreed to proceed only against the insurance proceeds the plaintiffs have also added state street as a defendant state street has a prepetition indemnification claim against the company under its investment manager agreement as trustee of the esop and has filed a contingent indemnity claim in the bankruptcy court on february 17 2005 the district court certified this matter to proceed as a class action on behalf of all participants in the esop it is not possible to quantify the potential exposure to the company at this time hall dba travel specialists v united   six travel agencies filed an antitrust class action suit against united and other air carriers in federal court in north carolina following the reduction by the air carrier defendants of commission rates payable to travel agents in 1997 1998 2001 and 2002 in alleged violation of the sherman act the agencies asked for the matter to be treated as a class action and sought treble damages for lost commissions and other injunctive relief the total amount claimed assuming liability is approximately 13 billion uniteds share of this amount was not separately alleged by plaintiffs upon uals chapter 11 filing this case was stayed as against united on october 30 2003 the trial court entered judgment on behalf of the carrier defendants and dismissed all of the plaintiffs claims on december 9 2004 an appellate court affirmed the trial courts ruling dismissing all claims plaintiffs have asked the appellate court to reconsider its decision   united was named in several similar lawsuits filed in the us and canada involving commission rates payable to travel agencies most of these cases have either been stayed or dismissed we do not expect the outcome of hall and the related cases to have any material affect upon uals consolidated financial position or results of operations litigation associated with september 11 terrorism   approximately 125 lawsuits against united are pending in the us district court for the southern district of new york related to the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks the suits allege a variety of liabilities including wrongful death injury or property damage and claim that united and others breached their duty of care to the passengers and to the ground victims identical actions have also been filed against american airlines and other defendants under the air transportation safety and system stabilization act of 2001 the act uniteds liability on such claims will be limited to the amount of uniteds insurance coverage in place as of the day of the attacks in addition approximately 98 of families of the victims of the september 11 terrorist attacks have opted to seek relief from a fund created under federal law to provide an alternative to litigation and as a consequence will not be seeking compensation from united united has stipulated that the automatic stay under the us bankruptcy code applicable to the lawsuits filed against united and covered up to the amount of uniteds insurance coverage can be modified so that these claims may proceed

 item 5 market for registrants common equity and related stockholder matters   our common stock 01 par value common stock has historically and principally traded on the new york stock exchange nyse under the symbol ual however as a result of the delisting of our securities the last day of trading on the nyse was april 2 2003 ual securities have traded on the overthecounter market otcbb since then under the symbol ualaqob   the following table sets forth the ranges of high and low sales prices per share of our common stock        we suspended the payment of cash dividends on the common stock in 2002 and we do not anticipate paying any dividends on the common stock in the future   we believe that uals presently outstanding equity securities will have no value and will be canceled under any plan of reorganization that we propose for this reason we urge that caution be exercised with respect to existing and future investments in any ual security   on march 1 2005 based on reports by the companys transfer agent for the common stock there were 66566 common stockholders of record   


 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview   over the past several years the company and the airline industry have been faced with severe business challenges and fundamental changes in the airline industry that have produced material adverse impacts on our results of operations financial position and liquidity we reported operating losses of 09 billion 14 billion and 28 billion for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively and we reported net losses of 17 billion 28 billion and 32 billion for the same respective periods our ongoing losses and increasing leverage coupled with our inability to obtain suitable sources of new financing and the initial rejection of our application for a loan guarantee by the atsb in late 2002 resulted in the december 9 2002 filing of voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code for ual united and 26 direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of the company   several significant events and trends have adversely impacted our operating revenues since 2000 general economic conditions in the united states began to weaken in 2001 and slower economic growth adversely impacted airline revenues for several years thereafter the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 significantly reduced consumer demand for air travel well into 2002 due to ongoing consumer concerns about further terrorist activities enhanced airport security measures were enacted into law shortly after the terrorist attacks which increased airport inconvenience and produced some negative customer reaction our revenues were also adversely affected by the enactment of federal taxes on ticket sales to fund those new security measures which reduced our net revenues from ticket sales since such taxes could not easily be passed on to customers in the form of higher ticket prices the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in early 2003 further reduced demand for air travel for a time particularly for air carriers like us with significant operations in asia the growth of lowcost carriers in the united states has placed further downward pressures on revenues by forcing us to compete with discounted fares offered by lowcost airlines in a growing percentage of the markets we serve the growth of such lowcost carriers has also added new capacity into the domestic us aviation system which has further aggravated the imbalance between air transportation supply and demand these and other adverse factors caused united mainline passenger revenue per revenue passenger mile to decline from 133 cents in 2000 the last year we reported an operating profit to 108 cents in 2004 we have been able to increase mainline load factors over the same time period to partially compensate for lower ticket prices in addition we have replaced some mainline flying by united with the operation of smaller aircraft by united express regional carriers these revenues have increased by 50 between 2002 and 2004   during the same time period our operating expenses have fluctuated as we sought to restructure our obligations in bankruptcy adjust our mainline and regional carrier operating capacity to match marketplace demand and cope with historically high jet fuel prices throughout this period united mainline operating cost per available seat mile increased from 106 cents in 2000 to 120 cents in 2001 and then declined to 102 cents by 2004 in spite of significant accomplishments in restructuring our operating expenses including significant contributions from employees and creditors through the bankruptcy process high fuel costs have had a significant adverse affect on unit operating costs particularly in 2003 and 2004   in the summer of 2004 we identified a further 2 billion in required future annual cash savings to be fully realized in fiscal year 2007 that we believe are necessary to qualify for nonguaranteed financing and to emerge from reorganization later in 2005 we are using all means available to us in the bankruptcy process to implement changes to our cbas to enable us to achieve approximately 725 million in average annual labor savings toward the 2 billion goal we are seeking operational savings and the termination and replacement of defined benefit pension plans to achieve the remainder of the 2 billion savings target chapter 11 restructuring efforts   the following sections describe details of restructuring efforts underway by the company in the areas of labor agreements defined benefit pension plans business improvement initiatives aircraft financings municipal bond obligations future operating fleet redeployment and reductions and the ongoing bankruptcy claims resolution process see note 1 voluntary reorganization under chapter 11 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on the reorganization process   labor restructuring   in march and april 2003 united employees represented by various unions ratified tentative agreements between the company and their unions to amend the thenexisting cbas these agreements when combined with compensation savings from the nonrepresented salaried and management employee group were expected to reduce our average annual labor costs by approximately 25 billion per year through 2009 as compared to expected costs under terms of the previous cbas we then devoted the next fourteen months of our restructuring to implementing a business plan to secure an atsb loan guarantee on terms that would have allowed us to emerge from bankruptcy with these revised cbas and existing pension plans intact   in june 2004 however the atsb issued a final denial for our application for a federal loan guarantee resulting in a need for the company to qualify for nonguaranteed exit financing this new requirement coupled with recent extraordinary increases in fuel prices and continuing weak revenue environment made it necessary for us to revisit our proposed cost structure particularly our expected labor costs which remain our single largest operating expense during the fourth quarter 2004 we advised the bankruptcy court that the continuing harsh financial environment across the industry and for the company made termination and replacement of our defined benefit pension plans necessary and that in addition our updated business plan would require approximately 725 million in further average annual labor savings from our union and nonrepresented employees in november 2004 we commenced the process available to us under section 1113 of the bankruptcy code to modify our cbas in an effort to achieve the necessary labor cost reductions from our union employees and to eliminate any cba requirement to maintain a defined benefit pension plan   effective january 1 2005 the company reduced the compensation of its nonrepresented salaried and management employees and announced changes to benefits and productivity for this group the combination of lower salaries benefit changes and workforce reductions are expected to provide the company with approximately 112 million of the targeted 725 million in average annual savings   on january 31 2005 the bankruptcy court approved amended cbas between the company and afa alpa pafca and twu all of whom had ratified such amendments that are expected to provide approximately 130 million 181 million 28 million and 02 million respectively in average annual savings through 2009 from changes in salaries work rules and benefits together with savings expected from salaried and management employees all expected savings realized to date for labor groups represents approximately 60 of the 725 million target   the alpa pafca and twu contracts also include contingent commitments to issue respectively 550 million 04 million and 24000 in convertible notes upon the emergence of the company from bankruptcy in the event the groups defined benefit pension plans are terminated these groups have agreed to eliminate any cba requirement to maintain and not to oppose efforts by the company to terminate their respective defined benefit pension plans   the afa alpa pafca and twu agreements each contain termination rights for the respective union among other things all provide that the unions can terminate the agreement upon two days notice and a failure of the company to cure within twenty days if the company fails to obtain specified levels of average annual savings from all other union groups and the companys salaried and management employees additionally the pafca and twu agreements each provide that the company can terminate the agreements if a court of competent jurisdiction enters a final order that the company is not entitled to terminate the defined benefit pension plans covering that employee group   we have been unable to reach ratified agreements on amended cbas with the employees represented by iam and amfa as such on january 6 2005 the bankruptcy court approved the companys 1113e motion seeking interim savings from iam the bankruptcy courts order effective through april 11 2005 requires a temporary pay rate reduction for iamrepresented employees of 115 and provides that these employees will receive 70 of the pay they would normally have received for sick days taken   likewise on january 31 2005 the bankruptcy court approved the companys 1113e motion seeking interim savings from amfa the bankruptcy courts order effective through may 31 2005 requires a temporary pay rate reduction for amfarepresented employees of 98 and that these employees receive 75 of the pay they would normally have received for sick days taken up to the first 15 days   these interim cost savings ordered by the bankruptcy court will provide the company with additional time to attempt to resolve the longerterm cost savings it needs from both iam and amfa and to work together to resolve pension issues if the company cannot reach ratifiable longterm agreements with both iam and amfa as well as an agreement with afa on pension matters the company will proceed to a trial under section 1113c of the bankruptcy code scheduled to begin on may 11 2005 in the bankruptcy court   the company has agreed to provide each union employee group a portion of the equity securities or other consideration provided to general unsecured creditors under any plan of reorganization proposed or supported by the company each union employee group is to receive a distribution based on the value of cost savings provided by that group   pensions our projected minimum pension funding obligation between 2005 and 2010 is approximately 49 billion for our defined benefit pension plans even after giving consideration to the temporary pension funding relief provided by the pension funding equity act of 2004 effective july 2004 the company ceased making contributions to its qualified defined benefit pension plans to preserve its liquidity and does not anticipate making further contributions however the company is current on its pension premium payments to the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc as of february 28 2005 we believe that in order to obtain nonguaranteed exit financing and successfully reorganize and emerge from chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings it is necessary to terminate and replace our defined benefit pension plans we are currently working with all employee groups to explore all issues and possibilities with respect to the future disposition of pension plans if consensual agreement is not reached the issue of pension termination also will be before the bankruptcy court at the trial scheduled to begin on may 11 2005   on november 30 2004 independent fiduciary services inc the independent fiduciary appointed by the company for its pension plans filed a motion in the bankruptcy court requesting the allowance of a 288 million to 993 million administrative claim against the company for unpaid minimum funding contributions with respect to the following defined benefit pension plans maintained by the company the flight attendant plan the union ground plan and the management administrative and public contact plan this matter is currently pending before the bankruptcy court see claims resolution process below for further details   on december 30 2004 the pbgc filed a complaint against the company in the us district court for the northern district of illinois the district court to seek the involuntary termination of the defined benefit pension plan of uniteds pilots the pbgc is seeking to assume pension responsibility for the companys active and retired pilots with benefit accruals terminated effective december 30 2004 the companys motion to refer the pbgcs involuntary termination action to the bankruptcy court was granted by the district court on january 27 2005 the pbgc has indicated that it may appeal the district courts decision the company is evaluating its legal and other options the company recorded a 152 million curtailment charge in the fourth quarter of 2004 relating to the pbgcs involuntary termination action   similarly on march 11 2005 the pbgc filed a complaint against the company in the us district court for the eastern district of virginia to seek the involuntary termination of the defined benefit pension plan of uniteds mechanics and related employees represented by amfa uniteds ramp and stores food services and security officer employees represented by iam and a small number of retired flight dispatchers the pbgc is seeking to assume pension responsibility with benefits accruals terminated effective march 11 2005 the company is studying the pbgcs actions and evaluating its legal and other options   historically the company has maintained a nonqualified supplemental retirement plan for management employees who have benefits under the taxqualified pension plan that cannot be paid due to internal revenue code irc limits on compensation or benefits in june 2003 we terminated all participation and benefit payments under the nonqualified plan for those participants who had terminated employment with the company prior to december 9 2002 effective february 28 2005 we terminated the nonqualified supplemental plan for all remaining participants   business improvement initiatives  as part of the companys goal to achieve 2 billion in annual cash savings by fiscal year 2007 certain initiatives have been identified to more efficiently operate our business for example the company expects to lower its cost of operations for aircraft maintenance and airports through more efficient use of labor and nonlabor resources in those divisions the cost of product distribution is also expected to be reduced by providing our customers with a better choice of lowcost means to reserve and purchase airline seats the company also expects to reduce costs through call center automation outsourcing and renegotiation of united express ground handling and air contracts the company did achieve significant savings in 2003 and 2004 in business improvement initiatives like these towards accomplishing the 5 billion in cash savings already realized and it expects to achieve similar types of savings toward the new goal of 2 billion in cash savings in future years   section 1110 aircraft restructuring all vendors are being paid for all goods furnished and services provided after the petition date in the ordinary course of business however under section 362 of the bankruptcy code actions to collect most of our prepetition liabilities are automatically stayed among other things except for liabilities relating to certain qualifying aircraft aircraft engines and other aircraftrelated equipment that are leased or subject to a security interest or conditional sale contract under section 1110 of the bankruptcy code actions to collect such aircraftrelated prepetition liabilities are automatically stayed for 60 days after the petition date the stay of such actions in our case ended on february 7 2003 except under two conditions a the debtor may extend the 60day period by agreement with the relevant financier and with court approval or b the debtor may agree to perform all of the obligations under the applicable lease or financing and cure any defaults as required under the bankruptcy code if neither of these conditions is met the lessor or financier may demand the return of the aircraft and enforce any of its contractual rights or remedies to sell lease or otherwise retain or dispose of such property   we have negotiated with our aircraft lessors and lenders to restructure existing financings to reduce aircraft ownership costs to better reflect current market rates and we have reached agreements in principle to restructure transactions with respect to a majority of our financed aircraft however the need for further cost reductions due to difficult changes in the airline industry substantially higher fuel prices and the continuing weak revenue environment has required us to reexamine these agreements and to seek to renegotiate certain of those financings to the extent we are unable to restructure any financings that we believe are unaffordable under our revised business plan we may face the possibility that one or more lessors or lenders may seek to repossess aircraft we also will need to finalize those agreements in principle and to the extent we are unable to do so we may likewise face the possibility of repossessions in either case the loss of a significant number of aircraft could result in a material adverse effect on our financial and operational performance   we are currently in discussions with a large group of mostly publicmarket financiers to renegotiate an agreement in principle for a group of aircraft reached in the summer of 2004 from which we subsequently withdrew due to the need for further cost reductions while we believe we can ultimately reach a mutually acceptable restructuring for the continued use of these aircraft at affordable rates the financiers have demanded the return of certain aircraft and there can be no assurance that these aircraft will be available for our continued use to date repossession of these aircraft has been enjoined by the bankruptcy court but to the extent the bankruptcy court or another court of competent jurisdiction permits the repossession of these or other aircraft our financial and operational performance could be adversely affected   we have also rejected or abandoned certain surplus aircraft to adjust our fleet size and composition to more closely match market demand and are continuing this process to achieve a reduced fleet of 455 aircraft in the first half of 2005 in addition as part of ongoing negotiations with financiers we have converted many longterm financing arrangements into shortterm operating leases and in several instances reacquired previously rejected aircraft as circumstances warranted   redeployment and reduction of fleet   on october 6 2004 the company announced a plan to expand its international route network redeploying aircraft to more profitable routes and reducing the overall size of its mainline fleet these actions are part of the companys ongoing strategy to adjust fleet size and route mix to current market conditions which continue to be intensely competitive fundamental changes in our industry demand that we take aggressive steps now to implement this plan to ensure that we remain competitive in the first half of 2005 the company expects to reallocate aircraft to more profitable routes expanding and strengthening the international network which will account for over 40 percent of uniteds global capacity while shifting some additional domestic flying to united express reduce uniteds mainline fleet to 455 aircraft  42 fewer aircraft than united flew in december 2004 and a reduction of 112 aircraft or nearly 20 percent of the fleet since december 2002 these changes are expected to result in international asms increasing by 14 percent with united mainline domestic asms declining by 12 percent for a total systemwide asm decline of 3 percent in 2005 as compared to 2004   in addition the ted fleet of aircraft will grow from 47 to 56 aircraft the company plans to expand its ted fleet by converting nine mainline a320 aircraft to the ted configuration   municipal bond obligations as a result of our bankruptcy filing we are not permitted to make payments on unsecured prepetition debt we have been advised that our special facility revenue bonds municipal bonds may be unsecured or in certain instances partially secured prepetition debt at december 31 2004 we had approximately 17 billion outstanding in municipal bonds that were issued on behalf of united to finance the construction of improvements at airportrelated facilities   during 2003 we filed complaints for declaratory judgment and corresponding motions for temporary restraining orders concerning uniteds municipal bond obligations which represent approximately 509 million in principal for facilities at the denver international airport den the new york city  john f kennedy international airport jfk the san francisco international airport sfo and the los angeles international airport lax in each case we sought clarification of our obligations to pay principal and interest under the applicable municipal bonds and the protection of our rights concerning related airport lease agreements at the applicable airports in addition we filed a complaint for declaratory judgment for all seven municipal bond issues which represents approximately 601 million in principal relating to our facilities at chicago ohare international airport ohare seeking among other things a declaration that a certain crossdefault provision in the ohare airport lease is unenforceable   we have received a favorable ruling for jfk and adverse rulings for den sfo and lax the company has appealed each of these adverse rulings and expects that the defendants will appeal the ruling in the jfk matter the outcome of these matters is uncertain and therefore the ultimate treatment of these municipal bond obligations in reorganization is uncertain   on february 15 2005 the bankruptcy court approved an agreement resolving the disputes between the parties to the ohare proceeding that in effect reduces the companys indebtedness related to these bond issues from approximately 601 million to 150 million the ohare settlement agreement the city of chicago a party to these adversary proceedings is not a party to the ohare settlement agreement   for further details see note 16 commitments contingent liabilities and uncertainties in the notes to consolidated financial statements   claims resolution process as permitted under the bankruptcy process our creditors have filed proofs of claim with the bankruptcy court and we expect new claims to be filed in the future approximately 44000 proofs of claim including latefiled claims have been filed so far with the bankruptcy court requesting payments from united through the claims resolution process we have identified many claims which we believe should be disallowed by the bankruptcy court for a number of reasons such as our identification of claims that are duplicative have been amended or superseded by later filed claims are without merit or are otherwise overstated we have filed omnibus objections to many of these claims and will continue to file additional objections as of december 31 2004 approximately 31000 of the total claims have either been withdrawn by the claimants or disallowed by the bankruptcy court   as of december 31 2004 approximately 13000 proofs of claim totaling 57 billion remain filed with the bankruptcy court the remaining amount of the proofs of claim filed continues to far exceed our estimate of ultimate liability differences in amount between claims filed by creditors and liabilities shown in our records continue to be investigated and resolved in connection with our claims resolution process while we have made significant progress to date we expect this process to continue for some time and believe that further resolution of claims will enable us to determine with more precision the likely range of creditor distributions under a proposed plan of reorganization we have recorded liability amounts for the claims that can be reasonably estimated and which we believe are probable of being allowed by the bankruptcy court and we have classified these as liabilities subject to compromise in the attached statements of consolidated financial position    we will continue to evaluate existing and new claims filed and will make adjustments as appropriate to date such adjustments have been material and we anticipate that future adjustments will be material as well at this time the ultimate number and allowed amount of such claims cannot be determined due primarily to the uncertainties of the chapter 11 process and the inprogress state of our investigation and resolution of submitted claims results of operations   the air travel business is subject to seasonal fluctuations our operations can be impacted by adverse weather and our first and fourthquarter results normally reflect reduced travel demand historically results of operations are better in the second and third quarters from 2001 through 2003 however the typical seasonal relationships were distorted by the events of september 11 2001 the fear of terrorism the iraq war fluctuations in fuel prices and general economic conditions the company experienced a more typical seasonal pattern of financial results in 2004   summary of results uals loss from operations was 09 billion in 2004 compared to 14 billion in 2003 and 28 billion in 2002 uals net loss for 2004 was 17 billion or 1525 per share compared to 28 billion or 2736 per share in 2003 and 32 billion or 5355 per share in 2002   the 2004 results included a favorable adjustment to passenger mainline revenue of 60 million an operating charge of 47 million related to our mileage plus frequent flyer program and nonoperating special items of 5 million additionally nonoperating expense includes 158 million in gains from the sale of investments as well as 611 million in reorganization expenses related to our bankruptcy filing   the 2003 results include operating special items of 178 million including curtailment charges of 152 million and nonoperating special items of 251 million additionally nonoperating expense includes 300 million in government compensation and 158 million in gains from the sale of investments as well as 12 billion in reorganization expenses related to our bankruptcy filing   the 2002 results include operating special items of 149 million additionally nonoperating expense includes 130 million in government compensation and 46 million in gains from the sale of investments as well as 10 million in reorganization costs   certain items are described more fully in note 1 voluntary reorganization under chapter 11 note 3 special items and note 7 investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements    as of third quarter 2004 all of our united express regional carrier revenues and expenses are presented gross on our financial statements prior periods have been reclassified to conform to this presentation see note 2i summary of significant accounting policies  united express in the notes to consolidated financial statements  2004 compared with 2003    operating revenues consolidated operating revenues increased by 10 or 15 billion in 2004 as compared to 2003 and uniteds mainline revenue per available seat mile increased 1 from 957 cents to 970 cents mainline passenger revenues increased 10 or 12 billion primarily due to a 10 increase in revenue passenger miles uniteds system available seat miles increased 6 and passenger load factor increased 27 points to 792 the following analysis by market is based on information reported to the dot for united      cargo revenues increased by 12 or 74 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 due to a 5 increase in cargo ton miles and a 6 increase in cargo yields other operating revenues decreased 12 or 175 million primarily due to a decrease of 295 million in united airlines fuel corporation uafc fuel sales to third parties partially offset by increases in third party maintenance revenues and uls revenues   operating expenses consolidated operating expenses increased 6 or 957 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 and uniteds mainline cost per available seat mile decreased 3 from 1046 cents to 1016 cents      a increased primarily as a result of a 33 increase in the average cost of fuel including tax and hedge impact and a 7 increase in consumption   b increased primarily due to increased capacity flown by our regional carriers   c increased as a result of increased levels of outsourcing of cargo handling and aircraft cleaning higher credit card discount fees and computer reservation system fees associated with higher passenger revenues and increased professional fees   d increased due to higher levels of maintenance activity including contracted maintenance and maintenance materials   e decreased primarily due to lower thirdparty fuel sales by uafc   f decreased due to restructuring of aircraft lease obligations and fleet reductions   g increased due to higher commissionable passenger revenues   other income expense other nonoperating expense amounted to 424 million in 2004 compared to 478 million in 2003 excluding special items reorganization items gains on sales and government compensation interest expense decreased 15 or 78 million primarily due to a lower number of mortgaged aircraft and lower fees and interest associated with our debtorinpossession secured financing dip financing interest income decreased 55 or 30 million primarily due to interest income on irs tax refunds received in 2003 offset partially by higher amounts of interest earned on restricted cash in 2004 2003 compared with 2002    operating revenues consolidated operating revenues decreased 6 or 894 million in 2003 as compared to 2002 and uniteds mainline revenue per available seat mile increased 1 from 952 cents to 957 cents mainline passenger revenues decreased 7 or 810 million due to a 5 decrease in revenue passenger miles and a 2 decrease in yield uniteds system available seat miles decreased 8 however passenger load factor increased 30 points to 765 the following analysis by market is based on information reported to the dot for united      cargo revenues decreased 6 or 43 million in 2004 as compared to 2003 due to a 17 decrease in cargo ton miles partially offset by a 13 increase in cargo yield other operating revenues decreased 17 or 289 million primarily due to a 209 million decrease in uafc fuel sales to third parties as well as decreases in thirdparty maintenance revenues and uls revenues   operating expenses consolidated operating expenses decreased 13 or 24 billion in 2003 as compared to 2002 and uniteds mainline cost per available seat mile decreased 8 from 1132 cents to 1046 cents      a decreased primarily as the result of lower capacity and new labor agreements for all employee groups that both lowered wage and benefit levels and enabled significant enhanced productivity levels the 2003 amount also includes a onetime benefit of 102 million for the reversal of a contractual payment to certain employees and changes in vacation accruals as a result of new lower pay rates for all union groups and a curtailment charge of 152 million   b increased primarily due to increased capacity flown by our regional carriers   c decreased due to lower thirdparty fuel sales by uafc   d decreased due to the restructuring and rejections of aircraft financings under section 1110   e decreased primarily due to a decrease in commissionable revenues   f decreased primarily due to volumedriven decreases in crew layover expenses and food and beverage costs   other income expense other nonoperating expense amounted to 478 million in 2003 compared to 527 million in 2002 excluding special items reorganization items gains on sales and government compensation interest expense decreased 11 or 63 million as we discontinued recording interest expense on all unsecured prepetition debt interest capitalized decreased 88 or 22 million as we discontinued capitalizing interest on advance payments for aircraft pending discussions with the aircraft manufacturers regarding the status of future deliveries liquidity and capital resources   the matters described in liquidity and capital resources to the extent that they relate to future events or expectations may be significantly affected by the chapter 11 reorganization process those proceedings involve or may result in various restrictions on the companys activities limitations on financing and may require bankruptcy court and creditors committee approval for various matters and may create uncertainty as to ongoing relationships with vendors suppliers customers and others with whom we may conduct or seek to conduct business   generally under the bankruptcy code most of a debtors liabilities must be satisfied in full before the debtors stockholders can receive any distribution on account of such shares the rights and claims of our various creditors and security holders will be determined by the confirmed plan of reorganization it is likely that prepetition unsecured claims against the company will be substantially impaired in connection with our reorganization at this time we can make no prediction concerning how each of these claims will be valued in the bankruptcy proceedings we believe that uals presently outstanding equity securities will have no value and it is expected that those securities will be canceled under any plan of reorganization that we propose   liquidity  uals total of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments including restricted cash was 22 billion at december 31 2004 compared to 24 billion at december 31 2003   as of december 31 2004 we had 877 million in restricted cash an increase of 198 million as compared to december 31 2003 restricted cash primarily represents cash collateral to secure workers compensation obligations security deposits for airport leases and reserves with institutions that process our credit card ticket sales prior to 2003 we met many of these obligations which were smaller in amount through surety bonds or secured letters of credit however such facilities are currently largely unavailable to us as a result we may be required to post significant additional cash collateral to meet such obligations in the future   the companys agreement with a bank for mastercard and visa processing currently does not provide the bank with the right to withhold any significant cash deposit to secure the banks potential obligations to card holders in the event the company does not provide the promised transportation services this fiveyear agreement expires on january 16 2006 the company is currently negotiating the terms of a replacement agreement in the event that the company does not successfully negotiate a replacement agreement on similar terms to the current agreement it is possible that the company will be required to provide a significant cash deposit to secure future processing of mastercard and visa charges for the companys ticket sales   operating activities for the year ended december 31 2004 we generated cash flow from operations of 99 million a significant decline of 902 million from operating cash flows generated in 2003 operations used cash of 11 billion in 2002 the significant improvement in operating cash flow in 2003 was partly due to the receipt of 365 million in income tax refunds and 314 million in government compensation together with other working capital changes   in october 2003 united and one of its subsidiaries uafc entered into an agreement with a third party to supply approximately 50 of the fuel required by united and uafc and assume some of their supply infrastructure and thirdparty sale agreements the third party acquires fuel on behalf of united and uafc transports it and maintains minimum inventory levels at specified locations for subsequent sale to them under this arrangement the company generated approximately 105 million of additional working capital during 2004 by reducing working capital requirements for fuel inventory and accounts receivable   we contributed 127 million towards our pension funding obligations in 2004 and 6 million in 2003 but made no cash contributions in 2002 instead we met our minimum required contribution in 2002 by using a portion of our credit balance the cumulative difference between the prior years minimum required contributions and actual contributions we currently anticipate that we will not make any further cash pension contributions and believe that it will be necessary for the company to terminate and replace its defined benefit pension plans to obtain nonguaranteed exit financing and successfully emerge from bankruptcy detailed information regarding our pension plans is included in note 15 retirement and postretirement plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements    investing activities cash used in investing activities was 322 million in 2004 compared to cash generated from investing activities of 271 million in 2003 and 71 million in 2002 the change from 2003 to 2004 primarily reflects fewer shortterm investment conversions to cash increased property additions including aircraft and aircraft spare parts fewer proceeds from aircraft sales and increased credit card holdbacks during 2004 we reacquired two b737 one b757 and one b777 aircraft all of which were previously rejected in addition four b767 aircraft were transferred to nonoperating status and we rejected andor returned to the lessor 27 b737 two b747 two b767 and four b777 aircraft under section 1110 of the bankruptcy code   additionally during 2004 we received 218 million from the sales of our investments in orbitz and air canada in 2003 and 2002 we received 150 million and 137 million respectively related to the sale of our investments in hotwire orbitz and cendant   financing activities cash flows used in financing activities were 46 million in 2004 and 336 million in 2003 compared to cash flows generated from financing activities of 266 million in 2002 during 2004 we made principal payments under debt and capital lease obligations of 180 million and 244 million respectively these amounts represent payments made under section 1110 elections for aircraft obligations which are currently classified as liabilities subject to compromise   during 2004 we made 313 million in principal payments on the dip financing in addition we renegotiated and expanded our dip financing availability allowing us to borrow an additional 513 million   during 2003 the sale of two b747 aircraft and certain equity investments enabled us to pay down a portion of the dip financing allowing for additional amounts to be drawn during the year this activity resulted in a net reduction to our obligations under the dip financing of 37 million   at december 31 2004 we had a total of 863 million in debt outstanding under the dip financing and 37 million in letters of credit for further details see note 1 voluntary reorganization under chapter 11  dip financing in the notes to consolidated financial statements    capital commitments and offbalance sheet arrangements   our business is very capital intensive requiring significant amounts of capital to fund the acquisition of assets particularly aircraft in the past we have funded the acquisition of aircraft through outright purchase by issuing debt by entering into capital or operating leases or through vendor financings we also often enter into longterm lease commitments with airports to ensure access to terminal cargo maintenance and other required facilities as can be seen in the table below these operating lease commitments which are sometimes referred to as offbalance sheet arrangements are significant   following is a summary of our material contractual cash obligations as of december 31 2004      although we are not generally permitted to make any payments on prepetition debt as a result of the bankruptcy filing we have reached agreements with certain aircraft financiers under section 1110 of the bankruptcy code and received approval from the bankruptcy court to continue to make payments on certain aircraft debt and lease obligations the amounts included in the above table represent only those obligations for which we have finalized an agreement however these numbers are still subject to change until such time as the plan of reorganization is approved and we emerge from bankruptcy in addition we may still assume assume and assign or reject certain executory contracts and unexpired leases pursuant to the bankruptcy code as a result we anticipate that other lease obligations as currently quantified in the preceding table will continue to change   at december 31 2004 our qualified and nonqualified future cash pension obligations approximated 49 billion for the period of 2005 through 2010 our future cash pension obligations under existing plan provisions would be 13 billion in 2005 27 billion in 2006 and 2007 08 billion in 2008 and 2009 and 01 billion in 2010 due to uncertainties regarding significant assumptions such as interest rates and asset returns involved in estimating future required contributions to our defined benefit pension plans we are not able to reasonably estimate our future required contributions beyond 2010 effective july 2004 the company ceased making contributions to its qualified defined benefit pension plans to preserve its liquidity and does not anticipate making further contributions the company believes that in order to obtain nonguaranteed exit financing and successfully reorganize and emerge from chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings it will be necessary to terminate and replace its defined benefit pension plans on december 30 2004 and march 11 2005 the pbgc filed complaints against the company to seek the involuntary termination of the defined benefit pension plan for certain employee groups these estimated amounts of future cash obligations provided above do not assume termination of any defined benefit pension plan nor do they take into consideration any cash obligations that may arise from any replacement plans due to significant uncertainties surrounding the future disposition of the companys defined benefit pension plans related estimated cash obligations have been omitted from the table of material contractual cash obligations above see chapter 11 restructuring efforts  pensions above for further details   at december 31 2004 our future cash postretirement benefit payments approximated 09 billion for the period of 2005 through 2010 due to uncertainties regarding significant assumptions involved in estimating future benefit payments under our postretirement obligations such as health care cost trend rates we are not able to reasonably estimate our future required cash flows beyond 2010   at december 31 2004 future commitments for the purchase of property and equipment principally aircraft approximated 18 billion after deducting advance payments our current commitments are primarily for the purchase of a319 a320 and b777 aircraft however since september 11 2001 we have reached agreements with the aircraft manufacturers enabling us to delay delivery of future orders since flexibility with our fleet plan is critical to our overall restructuring we continue to hold discussions regarding future deliveries and it is likely that the amount and timing of these obligations will change and could potentially be eliminated in their entirety the disposition of 161 million of advance payments made by the company to the manufacturers is also uncertain and will be subject to the ultimate outcome of these discussions in march 2005 united reached an agreement with respect to the undelivered b777 aircraft eliminating this obligation and allowing united to use a significant portion of the approximately 45 million in associated advance payments for other purposes however since that agreement remains subject to bankruptcy court approval we have not excluded those commitments from the obligations above   see note 9 longterm debt note 10 lease obligations note 15 retirement and postretirement plans and note 16 commitments contingent liabilities and uncertainties in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these items   offbalance sheet arrangements  an offbalance sheet arrangement is any transaction agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has 1 made guarantees 2 a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets 3 an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or 4 any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing liquidity market risk or credit risk support to the company or that engages in leasing hedging or research and development arrangements with the company the company has offbalance sheet arrangements related to 1 and 4 above as noted below   certain municipalities issued municipal bonds on behalf of united to finance the construction of improvements at airportrelated facilities the company leases facilities at airports where municipal bonds funded at least some of the construction of airportrelated projects however as a result of our bankruptcy filing we are not permitted to make payments on unsecured prepetition debt we have been advised that our municipal bonds may be unsecured or in certain instances partially secured prepetition debt at december 31 2004 12 billion in principal of such bonds was outstanding but not recorded in the statements of consolidated financial position in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap the company has determined that these bonds are prepetition obligations and accordingly has reclassified certain accrued and unpaid rent pertaining to these offbalance sheet arrangements to liabilities subject to compromise as of december 31 2004 ual and united had jointly guaranteed 60 million of such bonds and united had guaranteed 12 billion of such bonds including accrued interest for further details see municipal bond obligations above and note 16 commitments contingent liabilities and uncertainties in the notes to consolidated financial statements    we have various financing arrangements for aircraft in which the lessors are trusts established specifically to purchase finance and lease aircraft to us these leasing entities meet the criteria for variable interest entities however we are not considered the primary beneficiary of the leasing entities since the lease terms are consistent with market terms at the inception of the lease and do not include a residual value guarantee fixedprice purchase option or similar feature that obligates us to absorb decreases in value or entitles us to participate in increases in the value of the aircraft these financing arrangements include 114 aircraft operating leases that contain a fair market value purchase option these leases are subject to and would become effective upon the assumption of the leases by united in association with confirmation of a plan of reorganization in addition the company has 84operating leases that have either fixed price or fair market value purchase options the majority of which the company expects to renegotiate as permitted under section 1110 united does not guarantee the residual value of these leased aircraft   in addition the company has operating leases primarily for aircraft including the aircraft noted above with total future minimum lease payments of 145 billion as of december 31 2004 for detailed information see note 10 lease obligations in the notes to consolidated financial statements    capital resources jp morgan chase bank citicorp usa inc the cit groupbusiness credit inc and general electric capital corporation provide our dip financing a 10 billion financing facility of which only 900 million is available due to a 100 million holdback for collateral maintenance and liquidation expenses the dip financing consists of a revolving credit and letter of credit facility of 200 million and a term loan of 800 million which matures on september 30 2005 at december 31 2004 we had outstanding borrowings of 863 million and issued letters of credit totaling 37 million therefore we currently do not have any additional access to capital under the dip financing we believe that the existing dip financing is adequate to provide for our projected future liquidity needs through our emergence from bankruptcy   with the historically high fuel prices and continuing weak revenue environment we have continued to restructure our costs to achieve a business plan that will permit the company to qualify for nonguaranteed exit financing for our projected future liquidity needs upon emergence from bankruptcy this nonguaranteed exit financing together with other available cash and cash flows from future operations is expected to provide us with adequate levels of liquidity necessary for our ongoing operations and to service our restructured fixed obligations we expect that in order for the company to qualify for nonguaranteed exit financing we will be required to conform to financial covenants and that such financing would be approved as part of an overall plan of reorganization however the company cannot guarantee that such financing will be obtained or that a plan of reorganization will be approved or implemented successfully other information   price competition   uniteds domestic competitors have initiated fundamental changes to their fare structures to compete with lowcost carriers with significant fare adjustments continuing to occur in early 2005 fare discounting by competitors has historically had a negative effect on our financial results because we are generally required to match competitors fares to maintain passenger traffic because of vastly different cost structures low ticket prices that generate a profit for a lowcost carrier usually have a negative effect on our financial results we are unable to accurately predict the financial impact of existing and future competitive fare adjustments on our financial results   foreign operations we generate revenues and incur expenses in numerous foreign currencies such expenses include aircraft leases commissions catering personnel expense advertising and distribution costs customer service expenses and aircraft maintenance changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact our results of operations through changes in the dollar value of foreign currencydenominated operating revenues and expenses   despite the adverse effects a strengthening foreign currency may have on us originating traffic a strengthening of foreign currencies tends to increase reported revenue and operating income because our foreign currencydenominated operating revenue generally exceeds our foreign currencydenominated operating expense for each currency likewise despite the favorable effects a weakening foreign currency may have on us originating traffic a weakening of foreign currencies tends to decrease reported revenue and operating income   our biggest net foreign currency exposures are typically for the australian dollar british pound canadian dollar chinese renminbi hong kong dollar and japanese yen the table below sets forth our exposure to various currencies for 2004      our foreign operations involve insignificant amounts of dedicated physical assets however we do have sizable intangible assets related to our previous acquisitions of atlantic and latin american route authorities because operating authorities in international markets are governed by bilateral aviation agreements between the us and foreign countries changes in us or foreign government aviation policies can lead to the alteration or termination of existing air service agreements that could adversely impact the value of our international route authorities significant changes in such policies could also have a material impact on our operating revenues and results of operations   environmental and legal contingencies   united has been named as a potentially responsible party at certain environmental protection agency or state environmental protection agency epa or state epa cleanup sites that have been designated as superfund sites our alleged proportionate contributions at the sites are minimal however at sites where the epa or state epa has commenced litigation or administrative proceedings potential liability is joint and several additionally we have participated and are participating in remediation actions at certain other sites primarily airports we accrue the estimated cost of these actions when we have determined that it is probable that we are liable environmental regulations and remediation processes are subject to future change and determining the actual cost of remediation often requires further investigation and additional progress of the remediation therefore the ultimate disposition cannot be exactly predicted however while such ultimate cost may vary from our current estimate we believe the difference between the accrued reserve and the ultimate liability will not be material   ual has certain other contingencies resulting from the above environmental actions and other litigation and claims incident to the ordinary course of business management believes after considering a number of factors including but not limited to the views of legal counsel the nature of such contingencies and prior experience that the ultimate disposition of these contingencies is not likely to materially affect the companys financial condition operating results or liquidity   the company anticipates that its liability from claims arising from the events of september 11 2001 will be significant however we believe that under the act our liability will be limited to our insurance coverage we have not incurred any material environmental obligations relating to the events of september 11 2001   as a result of our chapter 11 filing as of the petition date virtually all pending litigation is stayed and absent further order of the bankruptcy court no party subject to certain exceptions may take any action again subject to certain exceptions to recover on prepetition claims against the company   critical accounting policies   critical accounting policies are defined as those that are affected by significant judgments and uncertainties and potentially could result in materially different accounting under different assumptions and conditions we have prepared the accompanying financial statements in conformity with gaap which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions we have identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of these financial statements   accounting for longlived assets we have approximately 142 billion in net book value of operating property and equipment at december 31 2004 in addition to the original cost of these assets their recorded value is impacted by a number of accounting policy elections including the estimation of useful lives and residual values and when necessary the recognition of asset impairment charges   we record aircraft at acquisition cost depreciable life is determined through economic analysis such as reviewing existing fleet plans and comparing estimated lives to other airlines that operate similar fleets older generation aircraft are assigned lives of 25 years that is generally consistent with the experience of united and the practice of other airlines as aircraft technology has improved useful life has increased and we have estimated the lives of new generation aircraft to be 30 years residual values are estimated based on our historical experience with regards to the sale of both aircraft and spare parts and are established in conjunction with the estimated useful lives of the related fleets residual values are based on current dollars when the aircraft are acquired and typically reflect asset values that have not reached the end of their physical life both depreciable lives and residual values are revised periodically to recognize changes in our fleet plan and other relevant information   our policy is to recognize an impairment charge when an assets carrying value exceeds its net undiscounted future cash flows and its fair market value the amount of the charge is the difference between the assets book value and fair market value sometimes estimated using thirdparty appraisals typically we estimate the undiscounted future cash flows for our various aircraft with financial models used by the company to make fleet and scheduling decisions these models utilize our projections of passenger yield fuel costs labor costs and other relevant factors specific to the markets where the aircraft will operate   in 2003 this process resulted in the recognition of an impairment charge of 26 million for the early retirement of the b767200 aircraft fleet see note 3 special items in the notes to consolidated financial statements    see note 2f summary of significant accounting policies  operating property and equipment in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding uniteds policies on accounting for longlived assets   frequent flyer accounting uniteds mileage plus frequent flyer program awards miles to passengers who fly on united ted united express the star alliance carriers and certain other airlines that participate in the program additionally united sells mileage credits to participating airline partners in the mileage plus program and uls sells mileage credits to nonairline business partners in either case the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on any airline that participates in the program in which case united pays a designated amount to the transporting carrier the company has an obligation to provide this future travel therefore we recognize a liability and corresponding expense for mileage earned by passengers who flew on united ted united express star alliance partners or one of the mileage plus airline partners for miles earned by members through nonairline business partners a portion of revenue from the sale of mileage is deferred and recognized when the transportation is provided   at december 31 2004 our estimated outstanding number of awards to be issued against earned and outstanding mileage credits was approximately 102 million as compared with 97 million at the end of the prior year we currently estimate that approximately 84 million of these awards will ultimately be redeemed and accordingly have recorded a liability of 840 million which includes the deferred revenue from the sale of miles to nonairline business partners we utilize a number of estimates in accounting for the mileage plus program that require management judgment   members may not reach the threshold necessary for a free ticket award and outstanding miles may not always be redeemed for free travel therefore based on historical data and other information we estimate how many miles will never be used for an award and exclude those miles from our estimate of the companys liability we also estimate the number of miles that will be used per award which can vary depending upon member choices from alternatives if actual miles used are more or less than previously estimated we must subsequently adjust the liability and corresponding expense   when a travel award level is attained by a mileage plus member we record a liability for the estimated incremental cost to united of providing the related future travel based on expected redemption for award redemptions on united uniteds incremental costs are estimated to include variable items such as fuel meals insurance and ticketing costs for what would otherwise be a vacant seat the estimate of incremental costs does not include any indirect costs or contribution to overhead or profit a change to these cost estimates could have a significant impact on our liability in the year of change as well as in future years since underlying variable cost factors such as the price of fuel can vary significantly from period to period   in 2004 17 million mileage plus travel awards were used on united as compared to 20 million in each of 2003 and 2002 this number represents the number of awards for which travel was actually provided and not the number of seats that were allocated to award travel these awards represented 74 of uniteds total revenue passenger miles in 2004 90 in 2003 and 78 in 2002 passenger preference for saver awards which have stringent seat inventory level limitations keeps the potential displacement of revenue passengers by award travel at an acceptable level total miles redeemed for travel on united in 2004 including travel awards and classofservice upgrades represented 77 of the total miles redeemed of which 71 were used for travel within the us and canada   in addition to the awards issued for travel on united approximately 23 of the total miles redeemed in 2004 were used for travel on partner airlines in these cases united estimates its liability based upon agreements with partner airlines that specify reimbursement rates costs to united for awards issued on partner airlines are generally much higher than incremental costs of awards issued for travel on united therefore a change in customer preference from united to a partner airline can significantly affect the estimated cost of mileage credits   pension accounting the company accounts for pension benefits using sfas no 87  employers accounting for pensions  sfas no 87 under sfas no 87 pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods and is generally calculated independently of funding decisions or requirements detailed information regarding our pension plans is included in note 15 retirement and postretirement plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements  our anticipated future funding requirements are discussed in chapter 11 restructuring efforts above   the calculation of pension expense and pension obligations requires the use of a number of assumptions including the assumed discount rate and the expected return on plan assets the fair value of plan assets increased from 70 billion at december 31 2003 to 72 billion at december 31 2004 higher benefit obligations resulting from increased retirements and declining discount rates have increased the difference between the plans fair value and accumulated benefit obligations from 57 billion at december 31 2003 to 60 billion at december 31 2004   we utilized a weightedaverage discount rate of 584 at december 31 2004 compared to 625 at december 31 2003 and 675 at december 31 2002 the discount rates were based on the rate link approach for 2004 and moodys aa bond index yield model for 2003 and 2002 adjusted according to the timing of expected cash flows for our future pension obligations duration is a commonly used measure of interest rate risk that either assumes that yield changes do not change the expected cash flows modified duration or assumes that expected cash flows may change given the fact that the yield changes effective duration since uniteds pension obligations are generally not satisfied in a single lump sum distribution management with assistance from our actuary used the modified duration methodology to determine an acceptable discount rate by matching the expected cash outflows of our pension obligations against available bonds with appropriate maturities   we assumed an expected rate of return on plan assets of 90 at december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 the expected return on plan assets is based on an evaluation of the historical behavior of the broad financial markets and the companys investment portfolio taking into consideration input from the plans investment consultant and actuary regarding expected longterm market conditions and investment management performance the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of assets to the following fund types 60 equities 35 fixed income and 5 other with approximate expected longterm rates of return of 10 75 and 15 respectively   we believe that the longterm asset allocation on average will approximate the targeted allocation and we regularly review the actual asset allocation to periodically rebalance the investments to the targeted allocation when appropriate pension expense is reduced by the expected return on plan assets which is measured by assuming the marketrelated value of plan assets increases at the expected rate of return the marketrelated value is a calculated value that phases in differences between the expected rate of return and the actual return over a period of five years   actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions under sfas no 87 those gains and losses are not required to be recognized currently as pension expense but instead may be deferred if the unrecognized net gain or loss exceeds 10 of the greater of the projected benefit obligations and the marketrelated value of plan assets the amount outside the 10 corridor is subject to amortization over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees at december 31 2004 we had unrecognized actuarial losses of 40 billion which will be amortized into future years pension expense additionally we had unrecognized prior service costs from past benefit improvements of 636 million which will be amortized as a component of pension expense over the average remaining service of the covered active employees   valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we initially recorded a tax valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the third quarter of 2002 in recording the valuation allowance management considered whether it was more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets would be realized this analysis included consideration of scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income carryback potential and tax planning strategies in accordance with sfas no 109  accounting for income taxes  at december 31 2004 our valuation allowance totaled 28 billion see also note 6 income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information   new accounting pronouncements   for detailed information see note 2 n summary of significant accounting

operations are forwardlooking and thus reflect the companys current expectations and beliefs with respect to certain current and future events and financial performance such forwardlooking statements

statements whether in response to new information unforeseen events changed circumstances or otherwise   


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   interest rate risk  uniteds exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to its debt obligations including capital leases and shortterm investments we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio our policy is to manage interest rate risk through a combination of fixed and floating rate debt and entering into swap agreements depending upon market conditions a portion of our borrowings is denominated in foreign currencies that expose us to risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates to hedge against some of this risk we have placed foreign currency deposits primarily for euros to meet foreign currency lease obligations designated in the respective currencies since unrealized marktomarket gains or losses on the foreign currency deposits are offset by the losses or gains on the foreign currency obligations we reduce our overall exposure to foreign currency exchange rate volatility the fair value of these deposits is determined based on the present value of future cash flows using an appropriate swap rate the fair value of longterm debt is based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or the present value of future cash flows using a us treasury rate that matches the remaining life of the instrument adjusted by a credit spread         1 estimated fair values represent the amount united would payreceive on december 31 2004 or december 31 2003 to terminate the contracts    price risk aircraft fuel  when market conditions indicate risk reduction is achievable united enters into fuel option contracts to reduce its price risk exposure to jet fuel the option contracts are designed to provide protection against sharp increases in the price of aircraft fuel as market conditions change so may uniteds hedging program during the second quarter of 2004 we began hedging future aircraft fuel purchases for 2004 and beyond      2 estimated fair values represent the amount united would payreceive on december 31 2004 to terminate the contracts

the pension plan that would otherwise be subject to code limitations however in february 2005 the company terminated the nonqualified pension plans for its salaried and management employees similarly the company believes that in order to obtain exit financing and successfully reorganize and emerge from chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings it will also be necessary to terminate and replace its defined

that he or she is an outside director of the company if any outside director is not a director for the entire calendar year the award of deferred stock units will be prorated each outside director may elect to forego the receipt of all or any portion of cash fees payable to him or her for service as a director ie meeting fees and committee fees and instead receive shares of the common stock equivalent in value to the cash fees based on the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date the cash fee is payable to the director the outside directors may also elect to defer the

in 2004 united employees performance incentive plan   under the terms of the ual corporation employees performance incentive plan referred to as the pip which was replaced as of january 1 2004 participants were able to receive additional cash compensation if the company met specified performance criteria and the employees individual performance warranted additional compensation prior to the beginning of each year the human resources subcommittee of the companys board of directors established a threshold level of pretax profit margin that the company would have to have obtained before any award would have been made under the pip for that year the human resources subcommittee also determined the appropriate performance objectives for each year that were related to specified areas including financial performance operational performance and customer satisfaction   under the pip an incentive award was typically paid in cash following the end of a calendar year however certain key employees were allowed to elect to defer receipt of their incentive awards and could have elected to receive their deferred incentive awards in common stock treasury shares or shares purchased in the open market the amount of stock that would have been paid to each employee was equal to the amount of the incentive award divided by the fair market value of the stock using a trailing fiveday average share price determined as of the date the incentive award would have been paid in cash but for the deferral election under the pip any employee who deferred his or her receipt of the incentive award for five or more years would also have been credited with an additional amount equal to 20 of the incentive award the human resources subcommittee administered the plan for all participants there was

bankruptcy considerations   the following discussion provides general background information regarding our chapter 11 cases and is not intended to be an exhaustive summary specific information pertaining to our bankruptcy filing may be obtained through the website wwwpdualcom    the airline industry is highly competitive and labor intensive our business is highly sensitive to fuel costs fare levels and demand for travel passenger demand and fare levels are influenced by among other things the state of the global economy domestic and international events airline capacity and pricing actions taken by carriers beginning in 2000 the slowing economy and decrease in highyield business travel among other things caused a significant decline in our revenues simultaneously our labor costs increased dramatically as we entered into new collective bargaining agreements with most of our employee groups that contained wage increases retroactive to mid2000 finally the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 had an unprecedented negative impact on passenger and cargo demand for air travel   in response to the events of september 11 we took dramatic steps to improve our financial condition these actions included reducing our flight schedule retiring aircraft curtailing new aircraft deliveries significantly reducing planned capital spending closing several reservation centers and international stations eliminating some commissions paid to travel agencies and significantly downsizing our workforce   in addition we tried to negotiate labor cost reductions from our unions in an amount and of a duration sufficient to ward off bankruptcy   despite these measures we depleted our cash reserves at an unprecedented rate and we were unable to obtain any meaningful levels of financing in the public or private capital markets   thus in june 2002 we approached the air transportation stabilization board the atsb for a 18 billion federal loan guarantee with a business plan contemplating capacity cuts revenue increases and lower labor costs on december 4 2002 the atsb decided not to approve our proposal for a federal loan guarantee facing approximately 875 million in debt maturities we filed for bankruptcy as the best means available to facilitate the implementation of necessary changes to our business and bring costs and operations in line with the current business environment   on december 9 2002 petition date ual united and 26 direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions to reorganize their businesses under chapter 11 of the

facility provided by bank one na and a 12 billion facility provided by jp morgan chase bank citicorp usa inc bank one na and the cit groupbusiness credit inc for more information on our dip financing see liquidity and capital resources in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 1 voluntary reorganization under chapter 11 in the notes to

course of business however under section 362 of the bankruptcy code actions to collect most of our prepetition liabilities are automatically stayed most of these prepetition liabilities will be settled under a plan of reorganization which must be approved by the bankruptcy court   since the petition date we have made substantial progress in restructuring united achieving a lower labor and nonlabor cost structure and improving revenue while sustaining superior levels of operating performance and customer satisfaction for example we negotiated new sixyear contracts with each of our unions which when combined with wage and benefit reductions for salaried and management employees will allow us to realize average annual labor savings of 25 billion by 2005 our business transformation office is implementing profit improvement initiatives in the areas of productivity strategic sourcing ticketing policy changes and others which are expected to deliver 14 billion in annual profit improvements in 2004 we launched a series of aggressive marketing and sales activities inventory management enhancements and route and capacity adjustments to improve our revenue performance and in the fourth quarter we outperformed the industry and grew unit revenue by 10 as compared to fourth quarter 2002 we also recorded our bestever performance in departures ontime this year and secondbest year for both departure completion and arrivals ontime within 14 minutes as measured by the department of transportation   integral to our overall reorganization efforts has been the restructuring of our aircraft fleet and the related financings under section 1110 of the bankruptcy code we have negotiated with lessors and lenders to restructure existing financings to current market rates and reduce aircraft ownership costs to date we have reached agreements in principle with respect to a substantial majority of our financed aircraft there can be no assurance however that those tentative agreements will be successfully converted to final contracts if we are unable to finalize these agreements there can be no assurance that we will be able to reach new agreements at comparable economics or that financiers will not repossess aircraft either of these outcomes although unlikely could have a material adverse affect on our financial and operational performance   in accordance with section 1110 of the bankruptcy code we have also rejected or abandoned certain surplus aircraft to adjust our fleet size and composition to more closely match market demand in addition we have converted many longerterm financing arrangements into shortterm operating leases through this process we expect to achieve average annual cash savings of approximately 900 million over the next five years when combined with the 25 billion in labor cost reductions and 14 billion in business transformation initiatives we are on track to generate approximately 5 billion in average annual cash savings by 2005 as compared to our prebankruptcy projections   pending approval of our updated application for a 16 billion federal loan guarantee from the atsb which we submitted on december 18 2003 jp morgan chase bank jp morgan and citicorp usa inc citigroup have agreed to provide a 20 billion exit financing facility exit facility an amount we believe results in an optimal level of liquidity upon emergence from bankruptcy the commitment letter for the exit facility was approved by the bankruptcy court on january 16 2004 under the exit facility jp morgan and citigroup will each underwrite 200 million of the nonguaranteed portion of the facility and 800 million of the guaranteed portion without an atsb loan guarantee we might be unable to obtain optimal or even sufficient funding to meet our future liquidity needs and reorganize successfully as of the date of this filing the atsb has not yet reached a decision on our application   to successfully exit chapter 11 we must obtain confirmation by the bankruptcy court of a plan of reorganization a plan of reorganization would among other things resolve our prepetition obligations set forth our revised capital structure and establish our corporate governance subsequent to exit from bankruptcy we are currently operating under an exclusive period which expires on april 7 2004 during which we are the only party permitted to file a plan of reorganization the decision as to when we will file a plan of reorganization depends on the timing and outcome of numerous ongoing matters in the chapter 11 process these issues include our pending application for a federal loan guarantee from the atsb pension obligations proposed changes to retiree medical benefits section 1110 aircraft restructuring efforts municipal bond obligations united express contracts and the prepetition claims we expect to file a plan of reorganization that provides for uals emergence from bankruptcy but there can be no assurance that the creditors committee will support our positions or our plan of reorganization disagreements between us and the creditors committee could adversely affect our reorganization process including our emergence from chapter 11 nor can there be any assurance that the bankruptcy court will confirm a plan of reorganization or that any such plan will be implemented successfully   we are working towards emerging from chapter 11 in the first half of 2004 but that timing is dependent on among other things the timely and successful confirmation and implementation of a plan of reorganization the rights and claims of various creditors and security holders will be determined by the plan as well at this time it is not possible to predict accurately the effect of the chapter 11 reorganization process on our business nor can we make any predictions concerning how each of these claims will be valued in the bankruptcy proceedings we believe that uals presently outstanding equity securities will have no value and it is expected that those securities will be canceled under any plan of reorganization that we propose for this reason we urge that caution be exercised with respect to existing and future investments in any ual security   for more information on our bankruptcy proceedings see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 1

international freight and global sp united cargos doortodoor delivery services include united sameday for packages under 70 pounds and united samedayplus for heavy freight freight accounts for most of united cargos shipments with mail making up the balance   during 2003 united cargo accounted for 5 of uals revenues by generating over 630 million in freight and mail revenue a 64 decrease versus 2002   united cargo seeks to leverage revenue opportunities created by our global route network and through strategic alliances while simultaneously creating a more competitive cost structure as part of these efforts during 2003 united cargo along with unisys corporation and two other cargo carriers launched cargo portal services an internet portal that allows customers to more easily book and manage shipments which we anticipate will reduce transaction costs for both the company and our customers we also outsourced the cargo handling functions at all north american warehouses as well as our cargo call center and as a result of a unique partnership between united and delta air lines inc were awarded a new expanded mailcarriage contract from the us postal service   ted in september 2003 we announced our plans to launch a lowfare operation ted with an initial firstyear fleet size of approximately 45 airbus a320 aircraft all of which will be redeployed from our current fleet we expect ted to operate at a lower cost than our mainline operation ted began flying customers in february 2004 with service from denver to reno las vegas phoenix new orleans tampa bay orlando ontario california and fort lauderdale a new market not previously served by united from denver beyond denverbased service ted offers service between las vegas and both los angeles and san francisco and between san francisco and phoenix in april 2004 ted will fly new service from washington dc to fort lauderdale and take on three existing washingtonbased routes to las vegas tampa bay and orlando   fuel   fuel is our second largest cost behind labor our fuel costs and consumption for the years 2003 2002 and 2001 were as follows      the price and availability of jet fuel significantly affect our operations for example at 2003 fuel consumption levels we estimate that every 001 change in the average annual pricepergallon of jet fuel will impact our fuel costs by approximately 22 million all other things being equal due to the highly competitive nature of the airline industry we may be unable to pass on to our customers any increased fuel costs that we may encounter   to ensure adequate supplies of fuel and to provide a measure of control over fuel costs we arrange to have fuel shipped on major pipelines and stored close to our major hub locations although we currently do not anticipate a significant reduction in the availability of jet fuel a number of factors make accurate predictions impossible including geopolitical uncertainties in oilproducing nations for example hostilities and political turmoil in iraq or other oilproducing nations could lead to disruptions in oil production andor to substantially increased oil prices   in the fourth quarter we entered into a jet fuel supply agreement with morgan stanley capital group inc that provides for the supply of jet fuel and the maintenance of jet fuel inventories at specified airport locations we expect that this arrangement will allow us to meet our jet fuel needs while reducing our working capital requirements for fuel   insurance   we carry hull and liability insurance of a type customary in the air transportation industry in amounts which we deem adequate covering passenger liability public liability and damage to our aircraft and other physical property since the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks our premiums have increased significantly   additionally after september 11 2001 commercial insurers cancelled our liability insurance for losses resulting from war and associated perils terrorism sabotage hijacking and other similar perils but we obtained replacement coverage through the federal government the homeland security act which became effective in february 2003 mandated the federal aviation administration faa to provide thirdparty passenger and hull warrisk insurance to commercial air carriers through august 31 2003 and permitted such coverage to be extended to december 31 2003 the emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act signed into law on april 16 2003 extends this warrisk insurance coverage to commercial air carriers through august 31 2004 and permits such coverage to be extended until december 31 2004 if the federal government determines such an extension is in the national interest we are unable to predict whether the government will extend this insurance coverage past august 31 2004 should the government discontinue this coverage obtaining comparable coverage from commercial underwriters could result in substantially higher premiums and more restrictive terms if it is available at all if we are unable to obtain adequate insurance our business would be materially affected   also we maintain other types of insurance such as property and casualty directors and officers cargo automobile and the like with limits and deductibles that are standard within the industry these premiums have also risen substantially since september 11 2001 coupled with lower limits   alliances   we have entered into a number of bilateral and multilateral alliances with other airlines to provide our customers more choices and to participate in markets worldwide that we do not serve directly these collaborative marketing arrangements typically include one or more of the following features joint frequent flyer participation code sharing of flight operations whereby one carriers flights can be marketed under the twoletter airline designator code of another carrier coordination of reservations baggage handling and flight schedules and other resourcesharing activities   the most significant of these is the star alliance Ô  a global integrated airline network cofounded by united in 1997 as of december 31 2003 star alliance carriers served approximately 700 destinations in approximately 128 countries with over 10791 daily flights current star alliance partners in addition to united are air canada air new zealand all nippon airways asiana the austrian airlines group which includes austrian airlines lauda air and austrian arrows formerly tyrolean bmi lot polish airlines lufthansa mexicana sas singapore airways spanair thai international airways and varig mexicana will leave the star alliance as of march 31 2004 and we will cease our code share agreement with them as of april 1 2004   we have a marketing partnership with us airways involving joint frequent flyer participation joint lounge access and code sharing on certain flights we currently code share on selected flights and expect to complete the implementation of the code sharing element of the partnership by april 2004 in may 2003 the chief executive board of star alliance approved the application of us airways to join the star alliance it is expected that us airways will join the star alliance in 2004   we have also formed independent marketing agreements with other air carriers including air china air dolomiti air nippon aloha bwia west indies airways continental connection operated by gulfstream fair inc dba ana connection great lakes airlines a regional carrier and virgin blue we continually evaluate the need for relationships with these and other carriers and from time to time expect to change our independent marketing partners as conditions warrant   in addition we operate the united express ® marketing program in north america under which independent regional carriers serve small and mediumsized cities and link them to our mainline network for more information on united express see united express contracts in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note 2 summary of significant accounting policies  united express in the notes to consolidated financial statements    mileage plus   our mileage plus frequent flyer program encourages customer loyalty by offering awards and services to frequent travelers there are more than 40 million members enrolled in mileage plus who earn mileage credit for flights on united united express the star alliance and certain other airlines that participate in the program miles also can be earned by purchasing the goods and services of our nonairline partners such as hotels car rental companies and credit card issuers mileage credits can be redeemed for free discounted or upgraded travel and nontravel awards for a detailed description of the treatment of mileage plus awards see critical accounting policies in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations    distribution channels   the majority of our airline inventory continues to be distributed through the traditional channels of travel agencies and global distribution systems however inventory distributed through the internet has increased significantly compared to 2002 industry conditions   operating environment   the air travel business is subject to seasonal fluctuations our operations can be adversely impacted by severe weather and our first and fourthquarter results normally reflect reduced travel demand historically operating results are better in the second and third quarters more recently however the typical seasonal relationships have been distorted by the events of september 11 2001 the sars epidemic and the iraq war   competition   the airline industry is highly competitive and volatile in domestic markets new and existing carriers are free to initiate service on any route our domestic competitors are primarily the other us airlines a number of which are lowfare carriers who have cost structures lower than ours   in our international service we compete not only with us airlines but also with foreign carriers our competition on specified international routes is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulations see industry regulation below as the us is the largest market for air travel worldwide our ability to generate us originating traffic from our integrated domestic route systems provides us with an advantage over nonus carriers additionally foreign carriers are prohibited by us law from carrying local passengers between two points in the us and we experience comparable restrictions in foreign countries in addition us carriers are often constrained from carrying passengers to points beyond designated international gateway cities due to limitations in air service agreements or restrictions imposed unilaterally by foreign governments to compensate for these structural limitations us and foreign carriers have entered into alliances and marketing arrangements that allow the carriers to feed traffic to each others flights see alliances above industry regulation   domestic regulation   general  all carriers engaged in air transportation in the us are subject to regulation by the department of transportation dot among its responsibilities the dot has authority to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity for domestic air transportation no air carrier unless exempted may provide air transportation without a dot certificate of public convenience and necessity grant international route authorities approve international code share agreements regulate methods of competition and enforce certain consumer protection regulations such as those dealing with advertising denied boarding compensation and baggage liability we operate under certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by the dot these certificates may be altered amended modified or suspended by the dot if public convenience and necessity so require or may be revoked for intentional failure to comply with the terms and conditions of a certificate   airlines are also regulated by the faa a division of the dot primarily in the areas of flight operations maintenance and other safety and technical matters the faa has authority to issue air carrier operating certificates and aircraft airworthiness certificates prescribe maintenance procedures and regulate pilot and other employee training among other responsibilities from time to time the faa issues rules that require air carriers to take certain actions such as the inspection or modification of aircraft and other equipment that may cause us to incur substantial unplanned expenses we are also subject to inquiries by these and other us and international regulatory bodies we do not believe that any such existing inquiries will have a material effect on our business   the airline industry is also subject to various other federal state and local laws and regulations the department of justice has jurisdiction over airline competition matters the us postal service has authority over certain aspects of the transportation of mail labor relations in the airline industry are generally governed by the railway labor act future regulatory and legal compliance developments in the us and abroad could materially adversely affect operations and increase operating costs for the airline industry including the company   airport access  access to landing and takeoff rights or slots at three major us airports and certain foreign airports served by united are subject to government regulation the faa has designated john f kennedy international airport and laguardia airport in new york and ronald reagan washington national airport in washington dc as high density traffic airports and has limited the number of departure and arrival slots at those airports slot restrictions at ohare international airport in chicago were eliminated in july 2002 and are slated to be eliminated at kennedy and laguardia by 2007 from time to time the elimination of slot restrictions has impacted our operational performance and reliability for example at ohare where the elimination has led to increased traffic congestion resulting in operational delays for a number of airlines including united   to address congestion concerns and delays at ohare united and american airlines reached an agreement with the faa in january 2004 to reduce each of their flight schedules at ohare effective march 2004 we will reduce our flight schedule by 5 percent between the peak hours of 100 pm and 800 pm in addition to reducing flights we also depeaked our schedule at ohare beginning in february 2004 we expect that these changes will improve the reliability of ohare flights without having a material effect on our financial results   legislation  the aviation and transportation security act the aviation security act enacted in november 2001 has had wideranging effects on our operations the aviation security act makes the federal government responsible for virtually all aspects of civil aviation security creating a new transportation security administration tsa which is a part of the department of homeland security pursuant to the homeland security act of 2002 under the aviation security act substantially all security screeners at airports are now federal employees and significant other aspects of airline and airport security are now overseen by the tsa pursuant to the aviation security act funding for airline and airport security is provided in part by a passenger security fee of 250 per flight capped at 1000 per round trip which is collected by the air carriers and remitted to the government in addition air carriers are required to submit to the government an additional security fee equal to the amount the air carrier paid for screening passengers and property in 2000   on april 16 2003 the emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act was signed into law the legislation included approximately 3 billion of direct compensation for us airlines of the total 24 billion compensates air carriers for lost revenues and costs related to aviation security additionally passenger and air carrier security fees were suspended from june 1 through september 30 2003 and governmentprovided warrisk insurance was extended for one year to august 2004 for detailed information on the legislations impact on united see note 3 special charges  government compensation in the notes to consolidated financial statements    international regulation   general  international air transportation is subject to extensive government regulation in connection with our international services we are regulated by both the us government and the governments of the foreign countries we serve in addition the availability of international routes to us carriers is regulated by treaties and related aviation agreements between the us and foreign governments and in some cases fares and schedules require the approval of the dot andor the relevant foreign governments   airport access  historically access to foreign markets has been tightly controlled through bilateral agreements between the us and the foreign country involved these agreements regulate the number of markets served the number of carriers allowed to serve the market and the frequency of their flights since the early 1990s the us has pursued a policy of open skies meaning all carriers have access to the destination under which the us government has negotiated a number of bilateral agreements allowing unrestricted access to foreign markets   while a considerable number of foreign governments have agreed to open skies several major airports remain subject to restrictive bilateral agreements among them are london heathrow and tokyo narita where we have significant operations further our ability to serve some countries and expand into certain others is limited by the absence altogether of aviation agreements between the us and the relevant governments shifts in us or foreign government aviation policies can lead to the alteration or termination of air service agreements between the us and other countries depending on the nature of the change the value of our route authorities may be enhanced or diminished   the european union eu is taking an increasingly active role in regulating international aviation in november 2002 the european court of justice issued a ruling that invalidated certain provisions of aviation agreements between the us and the eu the eu member states subsequently granted the eu commission a mandate to negotiate an air services agreement with the us on their behalf in granting the mandate the eu member states made clear that the existing bilateral agreements would remain in force while negotiations between the us and the eu continue   the european commission continues its attempts to modify the existing regulation that governs slots at eu airports the eu council of transport ministers however recently rejected the commissions efforts to ban secondary slot trading the eu parliament must now consider the councils position in the coming months separately the commission is expected to propose a comprehensive revision to the slot regulation in 2004   environmental regulations   the airline industry is subject to increasingly stringent federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning emissions to the air discharges to surface and subsurface waters safe drinking water and the management of hazardous substances oils and waste materials our industry is also subject to other environmental laws and regulations including those that require us to remediate soil or groundwater to meet certain objectives it is our policy to comply with all environmental laws and regulations which can require expenditures under the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund and similar environmental cleanup laws waste generators or owners or facility operators can be subject to liability for investigation and remediation costs at facilities that have been identified as requiring response actions we also conduct voluntary remediation actions such cleanup obligations arise from among other circumstances the operation of fueling facilities and primarily involve airport sites the costs associated with these activities are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business   the company along with a number of other air carriers entered into a voluntary agreement with the california air resources board regarding the reduction of air emissions from ground support equipment used at airports in the south coast air basin compliance with this agreement will require some expenditure of capital costs over a period of eight years   there is a dispute primarily among united american airlines and ogden services as well as northwest airlines and delta concerning the responsibility for payment of certain cleanup costs for groundwater and soil contamination near terminals 8 and 9 at new yorks kennedy airport the parties views on proper allocation of the costs differ this litigation which was initiated in 2000 in the supreme court of the state of new york is currently stayed because of our chapter 11 filing   in accordance with a june 1999 order issued by the california regional water quality control board crwqcb united along with most of the other tenants of the san francisco international airport has been investigating potential environmental contamination at the airport and conducting remediation when needed among these projects is an investigation and remediation project for solvent impacts to soil bedrock and groundwater at uniteds san francisco maintenance center this project is being conducted in accordance with crwqcb approvals   the us environmental protection agency and the state of california are seeking penalties and certain compliance program improvements from the company for alleged noncompliance with hazardous waste generator requirements at our san francisco maintenance center identified in 1999 and 2001 we have been working with both governmental entities to resolve this matter   in addition to the matters discussed above from time to time we become aware of potential noncompliance with environmental regulations which have either been identified by the company through our internal environmental compliance auditing program or through a governmental entity in some instances these matters could potentially become the subject of an administrative or judicial proceeding and could potentially involve monetary sanctions of 100000 or more   we do not expect these matters individually or collectively to have a material adverse effect on our business employees   as of december 31 2003 the company and its subsidiaries had approximately 63000 active employees of which approximately 78 are represented by various us labor organizations   the employee groups number of employees labor organization and current contract status for each of uniteds collective bargaining groups as of december 31 2003 were as follows      collective bargaining agreements cbas are negotiated under the railway labor act which governs labor relations in the transportation industry and typically do not contain an expiration date instead they specify an amendable date upon which the contract is considered open for amendment prior to the amendable date neither party is required to agree to modifications to the bargaining agreement nevertheless nothing prevents the parties from agreeing to start negotiations or to modify the agreement in advance of the amendable date contracts remain in effect while new agreements are negotiated during the negotiating period both the company and the negotiating union are required to maintain the status quo   for

sunsettermination   in july 1994 the stockholders of ual approved a plan of recapitalization that provided an approximate 55 equity and voting interest in ual to certain employees of united in exchange for wage concessions and workrule changes and the creation of employee stock ownership plans esops   as part of the recapitalization the companys stockholders approved an elaborate governance structure this structure and the special voting provisions it entailed terminated at sunset on march 7 2003 however the following provisions relating to the board of directors remain in effect

committee has the responsibility to nominate up to nine directors and the two union directors serve on the executive committee and on any other committees with responsibilities substantially the same as those of any committee on which the union directors were serving immediately prior to sunset we expect that our current corporate governance will change upon our emergence from chapter 11   for

 item 5 market for registrants common equity and related stockholder matters   our common stock 01 par value common stock has historically and principally traded on the new york stock exchange nyse under the symbol ual however as a result of the delisting of our securities the last day of trading on the nyse was april 2 2003 ual securities have traded on the overthecounter market otcbb since then under the symbol ualaqob the following table sets forth the ranges of high and low sales prices per share of our common stock          we have suspended the payment of cash dividends on the common stock and we do not anticipate paying any dividends on the common stock in the future   we believe that uals presently outstanding equity securities will have no value and it is expected that those securities will be canceled under any plan of reorganization that we propose for this reason we urge that caution be exercised with respect to existing and future investments in any ual security   on february 20 2004 based on reports by the companys transfer agent for the common stock there were 45296 common stockholders of record     


 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview   the airline industry is a highly competitive capital and laborintensive industry in 1994 ual created the largest employeeowned company in the us primarily as a means to reduce labor costs as a result for the initial sixyear period of the employee stock ownership plan esop we experienced costs that were significantly below the industry average however once the union contracts that were negotiated as part of the esop arrangement became amendable in 2000 the renegotiated labor contracts provided united employees with industryleading wages and as a result our cost structure went from industry competitive to uncompetitive   additionally beginning in early 2001 the weakening us economy had a significant impact on the airline industry as corporations reduced their business travel budgets and changed their travel behavior the terrorist attacks of 2001 and their direct impact on the airline industry further reduced our chances of successfully weathering the downturn in the economy throughout 2002 we continued to suffer from the weakened revenue environment resulting from the events of september 11 and the flagging us economy combined with uncompetitive labor contracts industry revenues remained below 1995 levels and negative media coverage of our financial situation caused uniteds unit revenue to underperform the industry consequently passenger revenues declined from 169 billion in 2000 to 119 billion in 2002   while we made efforts to bring costs into line with the reduced revenue environment including delaying or canceling capital investments retiring aircraft reducing schedules closing stations and reservations centers eliminating travel agency commissions and furloughing employees we were unable to stop burning cash because we were unable to obtain any meaningful outofcourt financing in the public or private capital markets we applied to the air transportation stabilization board atsb for a 18 billion federal loan guarantee however on december 4 2002 the atsb decided not to approve our application as a result on december 9 2002 petition date ual united and 26 of its direct and indirect subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions to reorganize under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code for further details regarding the chapter 11 cases see bankruptcy proceedings below and note 1 voluntary reorganization under chapter 11 in the notes to consolidated financial statements    when we filed for chapter 11 reorganization we had an uncompetitive cost structure overleveraged balance sheet cumbersome corporate governance structure excess fleet capacity and limited flexibility to meet changing market demands to address these challenges in 2003 we significantly reduced costs gained the flexibility to expand our portfolio of products to meet market demands and created a more streamlined and effective corporate governance structure   restructuring for lower costs and greater flexibility using the tools available through chapter 11 and by implementing internal processes for improvement we have significantly reduced costs and improved cash flow in a variety of ways   labor costs  we consensually negotiated new sixyear contracts with our unions which combined with wage and benefit reductions for salaried and management employees resulted in average annual savings of 25 billion as compared to the previous contracts by 2005 changes in work rules and scope have helped us achieve greater flexibility to offer competitive products to meet market demand   productivity and efficiency  we created an internal organization called the business transformation office to initiate and implement profit improvements through increased productivity strategic sourcing marketing alliances distribution changes and other initiatives during 2003 we achieved 12 billion of profit improvements and anticipate being able to achieve our goal of 14 billion in profit improvements in 2004   fleet cost and composition  we are using the chapter 11 process to significantly reduce aircraft ownership costs while bringing the airlines capacity and fleet composition into better alignment with current market demand   in total the restructuring process is expected to generate approximately 5 billion in annual cash savings by 2005 as compared to our prebankruptcy projections resulting in a transformed cost structure that we expect will make us cost competitive with other network carriers   improving revenue performance we improved our revenue performance in 2003 achieving a 10 improvement in unit revenue for the fourth quarter compared to fourth quarter 2002 outperforming the industry the improvement was driven by aggressive marketing and sales activities enhanced inventory management and route and capacity adjustments   improving corporate governance over the past year uals governance structure has been streamlined and we strengthened management accountability the esop termination in 2003 eliminated the existing complex governance structure and returned us to a more typical structure focused on maintaining a balance between management employees and all other stakeholders and providing us the flexibility to meet business demands bankruptcy considerations   to successfully exit chapter 11 we must obtain confirmation by the bankruptcy court of a plan of reorganization a plan of reorganization would among other things resolve our prepetition obligations set forth a revised capital structure and establish our corporate governance subsequent to exit from bankruptcy although we are working towards emerging from chapter 11 in the first half of 2004 that timing is dependent on among other things the timely and successful confirmation and implementation of a plan of reorganization the decision as to when we will file a plan of reorganization depends on the timing and outcome of numerous ongoing matters in the chapter 11 process we expect to file a plan of reorganization that provides for uals emergence from bankruptcy but there can be no assurance that the bankruptcy court will confirm a plan of reorganization or that the plan will be implemented successfully   we are currently operating under an exclusive period which expires april 7 2004 during which we are the only party permitted to file a plan of reorganization we believe the additional time will ensure that our plan of reorganization reflects the actual outcome of issues critical to our restructuring including our pending application for a federal loan guarantee from the air transportation stabilization board atsb pension obligations proposed changes to retiree medical benefits section 1110 aircraft restructuring efforts municipal bond obligations united express contracts and the claims resolution process   federal loan guarantee in december 2003 we submitted an updated application for a federal loan guarantee from the atsb after receiving conditional commitments from jp morgan chase bank and citicorp usa inc for 2 billion in exit financing based on our future liquidity needs we believe this is the amount needed to run our operations at an optimum level by attaining and maintaining a level of liquidity comparable to that of the rest of the industry to effectively compete in todays marketplace without an atsb loan guarantee we might be unable to obtain optimal or even sufficient funding to meet our future liquidity needs and reorganize successfully as of the date of this filing the atsb has not yet decided on our application see capital resources below for further details   pension obligations the combination of 45year low interest rates and volatile stock market returns have caused many us pension funds including ours to become underfunded as a result we would expect to make cash contributions to the qualified defined benefit pension plan trusts in future years in addition government funding requirements obligate us to pay on a goingforward basis a special funding surcharge referred to as a deficit reduction contribution drc that is generally imposed when a pension plans funding status drops below 90 this would require us to make significant accelerated contributions to our pension plans over the next few years as described below in liquidity and capital resources we currently estimate that we could be required to contribute approximately 41 billion to the qualified defined benefit pension plan trusts by the end of 2008 as part of our bankruptcy reorganization we must address the underfunded status of uniteds us pension plans we are working in several areas to address this issue on october 10 2003 we filed with the irs multiple applications for pension funding waivers for all of our us qualified defined benefit pension plans the waiver applications must be approved by the irs and such approval if granted is expected to take six to eight months if approved the waivers would allow us to smooth out the required contributions over a fiveyear period   in addition we continue to work closely with other airlines airline unions and the aflcio in support of a pension reform proposal that would allow companies affected by the drc requirements to defer certain accelerated pension funding contributions and smooth out minimum funding requirements over a longer period of time than provided by the current law in january 2004 the us senate passed legislation that would require united and other companies to meet pension obligations but over a longer period of time at the same time this legislation adopts a corporate bond rate for calculating pension liabilities for 2004 and 2005 used to determine minimum funding requirements this legislation must now be reconciled with a version passed by the us house of representatives before it is sent to the president for his signature there is no guarantee that this legislation will be enacted into law in the event that these steps are not successful or are insufficient to address the funding issues in planning for exit from bankruptcy we may need to take additional measures designed to help stabilize uniteds financial condition   retiree medical benefits as part of the chapter 11 process we are also seeking modifications under section 1114 of the bankruptcy code to the medical benefits we currently provide to our 35000 retired employees we plan to propose modifications which would make the medical benefit plan and contributions of those who retired before july 1 2003 comparable to the medical benefit plan and contributions now provided to employees who retire after that date while we plan to negotiate with our retiree representatives for consensual modifications there can be no assurance that we can achieve such agreements if we do not reach consensual agreements we will seek court approval of such modifications there can be no assurance that the bankruptcy court will approve such modifications   section 1110 aircraft restructuring under section 1110 of the bankruptcy code we have negotiated with lessors and lenders to restructure existing financings to reduce aircraft ownership costs to better reflect current market rates to date we have reached agreements in principle with respect to a substantial majority of our financed aircraft there can be no assurance however that those tentative arrangements will be successfully converted to final contracts to the extent we are unable to finalize these agreements there can be no assurance that we will be able to reach new agreements at comparable economics or that financiers will not repossess aircraft either of these outcomes although unlikely could have a material adverse affect on our financial and operational performance   in accordance with section 1110 of the bankruptcy code we have also rejected or abandoned certain surplus aircraft to adjust our fleet size and composition to more closely match market demand in addition we have converted many longerterm deals into shortterm operating leases through this process we expect to achieve cash savings of approximately 900 million annually over the next five years see note 1 voluntary reorganization under chapter 11 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details on section 1110 of the bankruptcy code   municipal bond obligations     at december 31 2003 we had approximately 17 billion in special facilities revenue bonds municipal bonds outstanding that were issued on behalf of united to build or improve airportrelated facilities the company leases facilities at airports pursuant to lease agreements where municipal bonds funded at least some of the airportrelated projects in connection with the financing agreements entered into by united with the issuance of these bonds we are required to make payments in amounts sufficient to cover the interest semiannually with principal payable upon maturity   under the bankruptcy code we are not permitted to make payments on unsecured prepetition debt without first notifying our creditors and receiving the approval of the bankruptcy court since we have been advised that our municipal bonds may be unsecured or in certain instances partially secured prepetition debt we cannot make payments on these bonds without first meeting the requirements outlined above for this reason we have classified all of the municipal bonds on our balance sheet as liabilities subject to compromise   section 365 of the bankruptcy code requires that we meet all of our postpetition obligations for unexpired leases of nonresidential real property in a timely manner we believe that we are in compliance with all payment obligations under our lease agreements relating to airports where we have not rejected our lease and have municipal bonds outstanding however we have not made and do not intend to make debt service payments or any other payment on account of any of the municipal bonds issued on behalf of the company relating to domestic airport financings as a result under certain of our airport lease agreements we may be considered in default due to nonpayment of the debt and therefore subject to the default provisions of our lease agreements with the airports possible consequences could include loss of our status as a signatory airline resulting in increased rents and landing fees and loss of our exclusive space agreements   we have taken a number of steps to reduce the risks associated with nonpayment on the municipal bonds previously we filed four complaints for declaratory judgment and corresponding motions for temporary restraining order concerning municipal bonds issued for facilities at the denver international airport the new york city  john f kennedy international airport the san francisco international airport and the los angeles international airport in each case we are seeking clarification of our obligations under the applicable municipal bonds and the protection of our rights concerning related airport lease agreements at the applicable airport until the bankruptcy court decides the merits of the complaints   subsequently the bankruptcy court entered an order that requires each of the defendants in these actions to give us a 15day notice and cure period before taking any action to terminate any of our rights concerning these airport leases until such time as the bankruptcy court enters final orders on uniteds declaratory judgment actions the bankruptcy court has conducted a hearing on motions for summary judgment filed by various parties   on september 18 2003 we filed a complaint for declaratory judgment for all seven municipal bond issues relating to our facilities at the chicago ohare international airport ohare seeking among other things a declaration that a certain crossdefault provision in the ohare airport lease is unenforceable   pending the bankruptcy courts ruling we are unable to predict what if any action might be taken in the future by either the bondholders or the airport authorities as a result of uniteds failure to pay these obligations as contractually required however we believe that the bankruptcy courts orders substantially reduce the risk of any declared default by providing us an opportunity to make required payments and preserve our rights under the leases   united express contracts during 2003 we reached new costcompetitive agreements with several of our united express carriers including air wisconsin mesa air group skywest and trans states to operate select portions of our united express service   despite our efforts to negotiate a similar costcompetitive agreement with atlantic coast airlines inc aca we have been unable to do so although our existing agreement with aca currently our largest united express carrier is effective until 2010 aca announced on july 28 2003 that it intends to establish a new independent lowfare airline based at washington dulles international airport   it is therefore unlikely that a new costcompetitive agreement with aca can be achieved however we remain committed to providing our washingtonbased and washingtonconnecting customers with the kind of regional schedule convenience they enjoy today in this regard we are currently working among other things to finalize arrangements for replacement service at dulles provided by certain current united express carriers and another carrier to ensure we maintain our current passenger capacity without aca if we conclude to reject our current agreement with aca also in january 2004 we reached an agreement with the metropolitan washington airport authority to permit an expansion plan for a new united express facility at dulles the expansion plan is expected to provide our customers with convenient connections and a seamless travel experience overall however failure to achieve a costcompetitive alternative to our current aca agreement could have an adverse impact on our future financial and operational results   claims resolution process as permitted under the bankruptcy process our creditors have filed proofs of claim with the bankruptcy court the total amount of such claims filed far exceeds our estimate of ultimate liability we believe that many of these claims are invalid because they are duplicative are based upon contingencies which have not occurred have been amended or superseded by later filed claims or are otherwise overstated differences in amount between claims filed by creditors and liabilities shown in our records are being investigated and resolved in connection with our claims resolution process while we have made significant progress to date we expect this process to continue for some time and believe that further reductions to the claims register will enable us to determine with more precision the likely range of creditor distributions under a proposed plan of reorganization at this time the ultimate number and allowed amount of such claims cannot be determined results of operations   summary of results the air travel business is subject to seasonal fluctuations uniteds operations are often adversely affected by winter weather and our first and fourthquarter results normally reflect reduced travel demand historically financial results are better in the second and third quarters the events of september 11 and the downturn in the us economy distorted the normal seasonal relationships in 2001 and 2002 further weak economic conditions as well as the us war with iraq and the outbreak of the sars epidemic continued to distort these relationships in 2003   for the past several years we have experienced greater fluctuations in unit revenue than the rest of the industry beginning in early 2001 the weakening us economy had a significant impact on the airline industry as corporations reduced their business travel budgets and changed their travel behavior thus the industry experienced significant declines in revenue during the first six months of 2001 particularly in us markets uniteds domestic passenger revenue was down 728 million 12 in the first six months of 2001 compared to the same period in 2000 partially driven from a 4 domestic capacity reduction and a 15 decline in business revenues domestic unit revenue was down 8 from 2000 domestic business revenue was down 631 million 15 in the first six months of 2001 driven by a 13 decline in volume and a 2 decline in yield during this period approximately 65 to 75 of uniteds domestic revenues were derived from business travelers which resulted in united being disproportionately affected by the industrywide decline in business travel as compared to competitors who rely less heavily on business travelers   the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 had a significant and immediate negative impact on passenger and cargo demand for air travel in a direct response to the adverse impact on air travel we reduced our capacity by 23 and began the process of furloughing 20000 employees and changing the size and composition of our fleet uniteds decline in unit revenue exceeded that of the industry overall in the wake of the september 11 terrorist attacks in early 2002 our yearoveryear unit revenues began improving each month rising from a 14 decline in january to a 4 decline in may however these gains stalled during 2002s third and fourth quarters as demand continued to be weak and yields declined particularly as we began discussing the possibility of filing for bankruptcy protection industry revenues continued to remain below 1995 levels and as is typical with a company in bankruptcy our revenue performance lagged that of our peers following the chapter 11 filings in december of 2002 uniteds unit revenue for 2002 decreased 4 from the prior year and yields declined 8 year over year   this underperformance in revenues accelerated in the first quarter of 2003 overall weak demand for air travel lingering customer concerns about our financial stability the outbreak of war in iraq and aggressive fare competition with lowcost competitors contributed to a 9 drop in passenger unit revenue in the first quarter of 2003 as compared to the same period of 2002   these factors continued into the second quarter of 2003 and were exacerbated by the outbreak of the sars epidemic particularly given our focus on trans and intrapacific traffic therefore we reduced our april schedule by 8 and our may schedule by another 4 compared to what we had previously planned with reductions concentrated in the pacific and atlantic regions simultaneously we instituted a number of pricing and inventory actions to maximize yield in this environment of reduced capacity as concerns over the iraq war and sars abated we introduced initiatives to improve our value to our core market of business customers such as a fly three fly free promotion in which passengers who buy three tickets get a fourth ticket free plus applicable taxes and fees as a result of these actions we began to see positive trends in may and june and passenger unit revenues went from a 17 yearoveryear decline in april to a modest yearoveryear improvement in june overall we experienced a 4 decrease in passenger unit revenue in the second quarter of 2003 versus the same period of 2002 by comparison unit revenue for the industry was flat quarter over quarter   as we approached the third quarter of 2003 advance bookings indicated that summer demand would be strong and industry capacity would fall short of this demand to capitalize on this situation we took additional actions to ensure we would capture a revenue premium we also reviewed and restructured many of our business fares to increase revenue by stimulating traffic and we continued our aggressive marketing campaign to reengage leisure customers by introducing additional promotions such as go go stay as a result passenger unit revenues increased by as much as 15 in august of 2003 with a yearoveryear increase of 12 for the third quarter as compared to an industry average increase of 7 we continued to see strong unit revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2003 with unit revenues increasing 10 over the fourth quarter of 2002 compared to an industry average increase of only 6 for the same period   uals loss from operations was 14 billion in 2003 compared to 28 billion in 2002 uals net loss for 2003 was 28 billion 2736 per share compared to 32 billion 5355 per share in 2002   the 2003 results include special charges of 178 million in operating expense including curtailment charges and 251 million in nonoperating expense additionally nonoperating income expense includes 300 million in government compensation and 158 million in gains from the sale of investments as well as 12 billion in reorganization expenses related to our bankruptcy filing   the 2002 results include a total of 149 million in special charges in operating expense additionally nonoperating income expense includes 130 million in government compensation and 46 million in gains from the sale of investments as well as 10 million in reorganization costs   each of the above items are described more fully in note 1 voluntary reorganization under chapter 11 note 3 special charges and note 8 investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements    during the third quarter of 2003 we began recording revenues and expenses related to certain united express carriers at gross rather than net see note 2i summary of significant accounting policies  united express in the notes to consolidated financial statements    2003 compared with 2002    operating revenues operating revenues decreased 562 million 4 and uniteds revenue per available seat mile unit revenue excluding regional affiliates increased 1 from 935 cents to 943 cents passenger revenues decreased 738 million 6 due to a 5 decrease in revenue passenger miles and a 2 decrease in yield uniteds available seat miles across the system decreased 8 from 2002 however passenger load factor increased 30 points to 765 the following analysis by market is based on information reported to the dot      cargo revenues decreased 43 million 6 as a 17 decrease in cargo ton miles was offset by a 13 increase in cargo yield other operating revenues decreased 289 million 17 primarily due to a 209 million decrease in fuel sales to third parties as well as decreases in maintenance sales and revenues at our uls subsidiary   operating expenses operating expenses decreased 20 billion 12 and uniteds cost per available seat mile unit cost decreased 75 from 1137 cents to 1052 cents salaries and related costs decreased 18 billion 25 primarily as the result of lower capacity and new labor agreements for all employee groups which both lowered wage and benefit levels and enabled significant enhanced productivity levels the 2003 amount also includes a onetime benefit of 102 million for the reversal of a contractual payment to certain employees and changes in vacation accruals as a result of new lower pay rates for all union groups aircraft fuel increased 151 million 8 as a 10 decrease in consumption was more than offset by a 20 increase in the average cost of fuel aircraft rent decreased 239 million 28 due to the restructuring and rejections of aircraft financings under section 1110 commissions decreased 139 million 33 primarily due to a decrease in commissionable revenues cost of sales decreased 237 million 19 primarily due to lower fuel sales to third parties other operating expenses decreased 292 million 19 due to volumedriven decreases in crew layover expenses and food and beverage costs   other income expense other nonoperating expense amounted to 482 million in 2003 compared to 534 million in 2002 excluding special charges reorganization items gains on sales and government compensation interest expense decreased 63 million 11 as we have discontinued recording interest expense on all unsecured prepetition debt interest capitalized decreased 22 million 88 as we discontinued capitalizing interest on advance payments for aircraft while we are in discussions with the aircraft manufacturers regarding the status of future deliveries 2002 compared with 2001    operating revenues operating revenues decreased 19 billion 12 and uniteds revenue per available seat mile unit revenue decreased 4 from 976 cents to 935 cents passenger revenues decreased 19 billion 14 due to a 6 decrease in revenue passenger miles and an 8 decrease in

to the dot      cargo revenues decreased 31 million 4 due primarily to a 5 decrease in cargo ton miles as cargo yields remained flat year over year other operating revenues increased 95 million 6 primarily due to increases in mileage plus thirdparty revenues   operating expenses operating expenses decreased 15 billion 8 and uniteds cost per available seat mile unit cost increased 08 from 1124 cents to 1133 cents excluding special charges aircraft fuel decreased 555 million 22 on a 14 decrease in consumption and a 10 decrease in fuel price purchased services decreased 239 million 15 primarily as a result of volumedriven decreases in gds global distribution systems and credit card discount fees aircraft maintenance decreased 141 million 20 due to retirements of older aircraft and a decrease in engine and aircraft repair volumes as a result of reduced flying commissions decreased 294 million 41 as united discontinued paying base commissions on all tickets purchased in the us and canada effective march 20 2002 as well as a decrease in commissionable revenues other operating expenses decreased 157 million 9 due to decreases in crew layover expenses and volumedriven food and beverage costs offset by increases in hull and liability insurance of approximately 100 million   other income expense other nonoperating expense amounted to 534 million in 2002 compared to 450 million in 2001 excluding special charges reorganization items gains on sales and government compensation interest expense increased 65 million 12 due to new debt issuances and increased borrowing rates interest capitalized decreased 54 million 68 primarily as a result of lower advance payments outstanding towards future aircraft purchases interest income decreased 45 million 43 due to lower investment balances combined with lower interest rates miscellaneous net decreased 64 million 74 primarily as a result of lower reserve requirements for legal and environmental costs liquidity and capital resources   the matters described in liquidity and capital resources to the extent that they relate to future events or expectations may be significantly affected by the chapter 11 process those proceedings involve or may result in various restrictions on the companys activities limitations on financing the need to obtain bankruptcy court and creditors committee approval for various matters and uncertainty as to relationships with vendors suppliers customers and others with whom we may conduct or seek to conduct business   generally under the bankruptcy code most of a debtors liabilities must be satisfied in full before the debtors stockholders can receive any distribution on account of such shares the rights and claims of our various creditors and security holders will be determined by the confirmed plan of reorganization further it is also likely that prepetition unsecured claims against the company will be substantially impaired in connection with our reorganization at this time we can make no prediction concerning how each of these claims will be valued in the bankruptcy proceedings we believe that uals presently outstanding equity securities will have no value and it is expected that those securities will be canceled under any plan of reorganization that we propose for this reason we urge that caution be exercised with respect to existing and future claims or investments in any ual security   liquidity uals total of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments including restricted cash was 24 billion at december 31 2003 compared to 19 billion at december 31 2002   as of december 31 2003 we had 679 million in restricted cash this primarily represents security for worker compensation obligations security deposits for airport leases and reserves with institutions that process our sales prior to 2002 we met many of these obligations through surety bonds or a secured letter of credit facility however such facilities are currently largely unavailable to us as a result we may be required to post additional cash collateral to support such obligations in the future   operating activities for the year ended december 31 2003 we generated cash flow from operations of 10 billion a significant improvement over the prior periods when our operations used 11 billion in 2002 and 160 million in 2001 during 2003 we received 365 million from the internal revenue service after resolving certain income tax refund claims we also received a total of 314 million in government compensation under the emergency wartime supplemental appropriations act of 2003 excluding these amounts our cash flow from operations was 322 million an improvement of 15 billion from 2002 reflecting the impact of significant cost reductions achieved through the restructuring process the 2002 period included the payment of 290 million in federal transportation taxes that had been deferred after the september 11 terrorist attacks as well as the receipt of 580 million in net income tax refunds and 130 million in government compensation   we contributed 6 million to our defined benefit pension plan trusts for us based employees in 2003 but made no cash contributions in 2001 or 2002 instead we met our minimum required contribution by using a portion of our credit balance the cumulative difference between the prior years minimum required contributions and actual contributions   in the absence of any additional pension funding relief we expect substantial contributions to be required in the future we estimate based on current market conditions and benefit plans that we could be required to contribute approximately 41 billion to our domestic qualified defined benefit pension plan trusts by the end of 2008 we also sponsor certain nonqualified pension plans that restore benefits that cannot be paid from the qualified pension plan due to internal revenue code restrictions benefit payments for these plans are expected to be approximately 60 to 70 million per year however future funding requirements depend upon factors such as interest rates funded status regulatory requirements and the level and timing of asset returns significant future changes to the companys demographic mix or pension plans could also impact future funding requirements additionally as described in bankruptcy proceedings  pension obligations we have filed pension funding waivers with the irs which could potentially allow us to reschedule our contributions and are working in support of legislation that could also impact our required contributions as a result actual future funding requirements may differ materially   investing activities cash flows from investing activities were 271 million in 2003 compared to cash flows of 71 million in 2002 and cash utilized in investing activities of 20 billion in 2001 the change from 2001 to 2002 and 2003 primarily reflects fewer aircraft deliveries in 2002 and 2003 as we restructured our aircraft delivery program to defer such deliveries to later dates and acquired most of the remaining aircraft through vendorfinanced purchases during 2003 we acquired one b757 aircraft off lease sold two b747 aircraft and rejected one b757 five b777 one a320 nine b747 and nine b737 aircraft under section 1110 of the bankruptcy code in addition eight b767 aircraft were transferred to nonoperating status   additionally during 2003 we received 150 million from the sales of our investments in hotwire and orbitz and in 2002 and 2001 we received 137 million and 259 million respectively related to the sale of our investments in galileo and cendant   at december 31 2003 future commitments for the purchase of property and equipment principally aircraft approximated 15 billion after deducting advance payments our current commitments would require the payment of an estimated 01 billion in 2004 04 billion in each of 2005 and 2006 05 billion in 2007 and 01 billion in 2008 and thereafter for the purchase of a319 a320 and b777 aircraft however since september 11 2001 we have reached agreements with the aircraft manufacturers enabling us to delay delivery of future orders since resetting our fleet plan is critical to our overall restructuring we continue to hold discussions regarding these deliveries and it is likely that the amount and timing of these obligations will change and could potentially be eliminated in their entirety the disposition of advance payments to the manufacturers of 161 million is also subject to the ultimate outcome of these discussions   financing activities cash flows used in financing activities were 336 million in 2003 compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of 266 million in 2002 and 21 billion in 2001 during 2003 we made principal payments under debt and capital lease obligations of 257 million and 270 million respectively these amounts represent payments made under section 1110 elections for aircraft obligations currently classified as liabilities subject to compromise   during 2003 the sale of two b747 aircraft and certain equity investments enabled us to pay down a portion of the dip financing allowing for additional amounts to be drawn during the year this activity resulted in a net reduction to our obligations under the dip financing of 37 million   at december 31 2003 we had a total of 663 million outstanding under the dip financing consisting of 300 million under the bank one facility and 363 under the club facility we are required to make monthly payments of 60 million under the bank one facility beginning in march 2004 with the final installment due july 2004 the outstanding balance under the club facility is due july 1 2004   capital commitments our business is very capital intensive requiring significant amounts of capital to fund the acquisition of assets particularly aircraft we have in the past funded the acquisition of aircraft through outright purchase by issuing debt entering into capital or operating leases or through vendor financings similarly we often enter into longterm lease commitments with airports to ensure access to terminal cargo maintenance and other such facilities as can be seen in the table below these operating lease commitments which are sometimes referred to as offbalance sheet debt are significant   following is a summary of our material contractual cash obligations as of december 31 2003      although we are not generally permitted to make any payments on prepetition debt as a result of the bankruptcy filing we have reached agreements with certain aircraft financiers under section 1110 of the bankruptcy code and received approval from the bankruptcy court to continue to make payments on certain aircraft debt and lease obligations the amounts included in the above table represent only those obligations for which we have finalized an agreement however these numbers are still subject to change until such time as the plan of reorganization is approved and we emerge from bankruptcy in addition we may still assume assume and assign or reject certain executory contracts and unexpired leases pursuant to the bankruptcy code as a result we anticipate that other lease obligations as currently identified in the above table will continue to change as well   the pension and postretirement cash obligations as of december 31 2003 do not assume any changes to required contributions based on either waivers obtained from the government to spread the minimum cash contributions for pensions over a longer period or other changes enacted by the government or the bankruptcy court see bankruptcy proceedings  pension obligations and retiree medical benefits   see note 10 longterm debt note 11 lease obligations note 16 retirement and postretirement plans and note 17 commitments contingent liabilities and uncertainties in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these items   capital resources pending the approval of our application for a 16 billion federal loan guarantee from the atsb which we updated with the atsb on december 18 2003 jp morgan chase bank jp morgan and citicorp usa inc citigroup have agreed to provide a 20 billion exit financing facility which is the amount of funding we believe we need to operate upon emergence from bankruptcy exit facility the commitment letter for the exit facility was approved by the bankruptcy court on january 16 2004 under the exit facility jp morgan and citigroup will each underwrite 200 million of the nonguaranteed portion of the facility and 800 million of the guaranteed portion without an atsb loan guarantee we might be unable to obtain optimal or even sufficient funding to meet our future liquidity needs and reorganize successfully as of the date of this filing the atsb has not yet decided on our application other information   labor agreements   in march and april 2003 united employees represented by various unions ratified tentative agreements between the company and their unions to modify existing collective bargaining agreements cbas all of these agreements became effective on may 1 2003 and become amendable in six years when combined with expected average annual savings of approximately 300 million in salaried and management costs achieved through wage and staffing reductions as well as benefit changes these agreements are expected to reduce our average annual labor costs by approximately 25 billion per year by 2005 versus the previous contracts in addition to reductions in pay all of the contracts allow for productivity improvements through changes to work rules and for changes in employees medical benefit plans including increases to copayments these changes combined with overall headcount reductions enabled us to reduce salaries and related costs by nearly 18 billion 25 in 2003 as compared to 2002   other workgroup specific changes are described below   on april 11 2003 pilots represented by the air line pilots association international alpa ratified a tentative agreement on a restructured cba the new cba reduces pay and benefits and through workrule changes improves productivity by an average of approximately 11 billion per year versus the previous contract as part of these changes pilots retirement benefits have been reduced through a decrease in the companys contribution to the pilots defined contribution plan and a reduction in the benefit formula for their defined benefit plan the agreement also provides us with significantly enhanced flexibility with respect to regional jets and code share arrangements there is also an agreement which provides for alpa to retain a seat on uals board of directors   on april 29 2003 united flight attendants ratified a tentative agreement between the company and the association of flight attendants afa on a restructured cba which is expected to reduce our average annual costs by approximately 300 million versus the previous cba as part of these changes pension benefits for future retiring flight attendants have been reduced through changes in the afa pension plan   on april 29 2003 united employees represented by the international association of machinists and aerospace workers iam district lodge 141 ratified an agreement between the company and the iam on four restructured cbas as well as on a restructured cba for employees of our subsidiary mileage plus inc the agreements reduce average annual costs by approximately 450 million versus the previous cbas on april 29 2003 employees represented by iam district lodge 141m ratified agreements between the company and the iam on three restructured cbas the agreements will reduce average annual costs by approximately 350 million versus the previous cbas these agreements also provide ual increased flexibility with respect to outsourcing there is also an agreement which provides for the iam to retain a seat on uals board of directors in july 2003 the national mediation board announced that uniteds mechanics and related employees who were previously represented by the iam 141m had voted to change their union representation to the aircraft mechanics fraternal association this change in representation will not affect the terms or duration of the cba agreement ratified in april   on april 11 2003 uniteds dispatchers represented by the professional airline flight control association pafca ratified a tentative agreement between pafca and the company on a restructured cba which is expected to reduce average annual costs by approximately 4 million versus the previous cba the restructured cba also transfers dispatchers to the management administrative and public contact pension plan on march 23 2003 united meteorologists represented by the transport workers union twu ratified a tentative agreement between the twu and the company on a restructured cba that is expected to reduce average annual costs by approximately 1 million versus the previous cba   in addition all of the agreements provide for various common features these include implementation of a companywide successsharing program that provides the opportunity for payouts tied to the companys level of profitability operational performance and customer satisfaction the agreements also provide us with an opportunity to introduce a lowcost operation which began operations from denver in february 2004 serving eight cities   we also agreed to include in our plan of reorganization provisions for each relevant employee group to receive a distribution of the equity securities or other consideration provided to the prepetition general unsecured creditors in addition we have agreed that any plan of reorganization we propose or support will provide the relevant employee group with a distribution of the abovedescribed equity securities or other consideration as compared to the total distribution provided to all employee groups that matches the proportion of each employee groups contribution to total employee cost reductions   foreign operations   we generate revenues and incur expenses in numerous foreign currencies such expenses include aircraft leases commissions catering personnel expense advertising and distribution costs customer service expenses and aircraft maintenance changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact our operating income through changes in foreign currencydenominated operating revenues and expenses   despite the adverse effects a strengthening foreign currency may have on us originating traffic a strengthening of foreign currencies tends to increase reported revenue and operating income because our foreign currencydenominated operating revenue generally exceeds our foreign currencydenominated operating expense for each currency likewise despite the favorable effects a weakening foreign currency may have on us originating traffic a weakening of foreign currencies tends to decrease reported revenue and operating income   our biggest net exposures are typically for british pound canadian dollar hong kong dollar euro and japanese yen the table below sets forth our exposure to various currencies for 2003      our foreign operations involve insignificant amounts of dedicated physical assets however we do have sizable intangible assets related to our previous acquisitions of atlantic and latin america route authorities because operating authorities in international markets are governed by bilateral aviation agreements between the us and foreign countries changes in us or foreign government aviation policies can lead to the alteration or termination of existing air service agreements that could adversely impact the value of our international route authorities significant changes in such policies could also have a material impact on our operating revenues and results of operations   environmental and legal contingencies   united has been named as a potentially responsible party at certain environmental protection agency or state environmental protection agency epa or state epa cleanup sites that have been designated as superfund sites our alleged proportionate contributions at the sites are minimal however at sites where the epa or state epa has commenced litigation or administrative proceedings potential liability is joint and several additionally we have participated and are participating in remediation actions at certain other sites primarily airports we accrue the estimated cost of these actions when we have determined that it is probable that we are liable environmental regulations and remediation processes are subject to future change and determining the actual cost of remediation will require further investigation and additional progress of the remediation therefore the ultimate disposition cannot be determined at this time however while such cost may vary from our current estimate we believe the difference between the accrued reserve and the ultimate liability will not be material   ual has certain other contingencies resulting from the above environmental actions and other litigation and claims incident to the ordinary course of business management believes after considering a number of factors including but not limited to the views of legal counsel the nature of such contingencies and prior experience that the ultimate disposition of these contingencies is not likely to materially affect the companys financial condition operating results or liquidity   as a result of our chapter 11 filing as of the petition date virtually all pending litigation is stayed and absent further order of the bankruptcy court no party subject to certain exceptions may take any action again subject to certain exceptions to recover on prepetition claims against the company   critical accounting policies   critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions we have prepared the accompanying financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions we have identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of these financial statements   accounting for longlived assets we have approximately 15 billion in operating property and equipment at december 31 2003 in addition to the original cost of these assets their recorded value is impacted by a number of policy elections including the estimation of useful lives and residual values and when necessary impairment charges   we record aircraft at acquisition cost upon delivery depreciable life is determined through economic analysis reviewing existing fleet plans and comparing estimated lives to other airlines that operate similar fleets older generation aircraft are assigned lives of 25 years which is consistent with the experience of united and other airlines as aircraft technology has improved useful life has increased and thus we have estimated the lives of new generation aircraft to be 30 years residual values are estimated based on our historical experience with regards to the sale of both aircraft and spare parts and are established in conjunction with the estimated useful lives of the aircraft residual values are based on current dollars when the aircraft are acquired and typically reflect asset values that have not reached the end of their physical life both depreciable lives and residual values are revised periodically to recognize changes in our fleet plan and changes in conditions   our policy is to recognize an impairment charge when an assets carrying value exceeds its net undiscounted future cash flows and its fair market value the amount of the charge is the difference between the assets carrying value and fair market value estimated using third party appraisals typically we estimate the undiscounted future cash flows for our aircraft fleet with models used to make fleet and scheduling decisions these models utilize our projections of passenger yield fuel costs labor costs and other relevant factors for the markets where the specific aircraft will operate   in 2003 this process resulted in the recognition of an impairment charge of 26 million for the early retirement of the b767200 aircraft fleet in 2001 we recorded an impairment charge of 517 million for the b737500 and b747400 aircraft fleets resulting from the anticipated decrease in future cash flows see note 3 special charges in the notes to consolidated financial statements    see note 2f summary of significant accounting policies  operating property and equipment in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding uniteds policies on accounting for longlived assets   frequent flyer accounting uniteds mileage plus frequent flyer program awards miles to passengers who fly on united ted united express the star alliance carriers and certain other airlines that participate in the program additionally united sells mileage credits to participating airline partners in the mileage plus program and uls sells mileage credits to nonairline business partners in either case the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on any airline that participates in the program in which case united pays a designated amount to the transporting carrier the company has an obligation to provide this future travel therefore we recognize a liability and corresponding expense for mileage awards to passengers redeeming on united ted united express or one of the mileage plus partners for miles sold to nonairline business partners a portion of revenue from the sale of mileage is deferred and recognized when the transportation is provided   at december 31 2003 our estimated outstanding number of awards was approximately 97 million as compared with 105 million at the end of the prior year we currently estimate that approximately 80 million of these awards will ultimately be redeemed and accordingly have recorded a liability of 717 million which includes the deferred revenue from the sale of miles to program participants we utilize a number of estimates in accounting for the mileage plus program that require management judgment   members may not reach the threshold necessary for a free ticket and outstanding miles may not always be redeemed for free travel therefore we estimate how many miles will never be used for an award and exclude those miles from our estimate of the liability based on historical data the difference between the awards expected to be redeemed and the total awards outstanding arises because some awards will never be redeemed and some will be redeemed on partner carriers we also estimate the number of miles that will be used per award if actual miles used are more or less than estimated we must adjust the liability and corresponding expense   when a travel award level is attained we record a liability for the estimated incremental costs of providing travel based on expected redemptions uniteds incremental costs include the additional costs of providing service to the award recipient such as fuel meals insurance and ticketing costs for what would otherwise be a vacant seat the incremental costs do not include any contribution to overhead or profit a change to these cost estimates could have a significant impact on our liability in the year of change as well as in future years   in each of 2003 2002 and 2001 20 million mileage plus travel awards were used on united this number represents the number of awards for which travel was actually provided and not the number of seats that were allocated to award travel these awards represented 90 of uniteds total revenue passenger miles in 2003 78 in 2002 and 81 in 2001 passenger preference for saver awards which have stringent inventory controls keeps displacement of revenue passengers at a minimum total miles redeemed for travel on united in 2003 including awards and upgrades represented 78 of the total miles redeemed of which 72 were used for travel within the us and canada in addition to the awards issued for travel on united approximately 22 of the total miles redeemed in 2003 were used for travel on partner airlines   as the company also sells mileage credits to participating airline and nonairline partners a change to either the time period over which the credits are used or the estimate of the number or fair value of tickets could have a significant impact on our revenues in the year of change as well as future years additional information regarding the mileage plus frequent flyer program is included in note 2g summary of significant accounting policies  mileage plus awards in the notes to consolidated financial statements    pension benefits the company accounts for pension benefits using sfas no 87 employers accounting for pensions sfas no 87 under sfas no 87 pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods and is generally calculated independent of funding decisions or requirements detailed information regarding our pension plans is included in note 16 retirement and postretirement plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements  our anticipated future funding requirements are discussed in liquidity and capital resources above   the calculation of pension expense and pension obligations requires the use of a number of assumptions including the assumed discount rate and the expected return on plan assets the fair value of plan assets increased from 63 billion at december 31 2002 to 70 billion at december 31 2003 despite an increase in investment returns higher benefit obligations resulting from increased retirements and declining discount rates have increased the difference between the plans fair value and accumulated benefit obligations from 47 billion at december 31 2002 to 57 billion at december 31 2003   we utilized a discount rate of 625 at december 31 2003 compared to 675 at december 31 2002 and 75 at december 31 2001 the discount rate is based on the moodys aa bond index as of december 31 2003 adjusted for the duration of our pension obligations duration is a commonly used measure of interest rate risk that either assumes that yield changes do not change the expected cash flows modified duration or assumes that expected cash flows may change given the fact that the yield changes effective duration since uniteds pension obligations are generally not satisfied in a single lump sum distribution management with assistance from our actuary used the modified duration methodology to determine an acceptable discount rate by matching the expected cash outflows of our pension obligations against available bonds with appropriate maturities   we assumed an expected rate of return on plan assets of 90 at december 31 2003 and 2002 compared to 975 used at december 31 2001 the expected return on plan assets is based on an evaluation of the historical behavior of the broad financial markets and the companys investment portfolio taking into consideration input from the plans investment consultant and actuary regarding expected longterm market conditions and investment management performance the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of assets to the following fund types 60 equities 35 fixed income and 5 other with expected longterm rates of return of 10 75 and 15 respectively   we believe that the longterm asset allocation on average will approximate the targeted allocation and regularly review the actual asset allocation to periodically rebalance the investments to the targeted allocation when appropriate pension expense is reduced by the expected return on plan assets which is measured by assuming the marketrelated value of plan assets increases at the expected rate of return the marketrelated value is a calculated value that phases in differences between the expected rate of return and the actual return over a period of five years   actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions under sfas no 87 those gains and losses are not required to be recognized currently as pension expense but instead may be deferred if the unrecognized net gain or loss exceeds 10 of the greater of the projected benefit obligations and the marketrelated value of plan assets the amount outside the 10 corridor is subject to amortization over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees at december 31 2003 we had unrecognized actuarial losses of 39 billion which will be amortized into future years pension expense the amount of amortization is expected to be approximately 80 million 125 million and 155 million in 2004 2005 and 2006 respectively additionally we had unrecognized prior service costs from past benefit improvements of 870 million which will be amortized as a component of pension expense over the average remaining service of the covered active employees the amount of amortization is expected to be approximately 85 million in each of 2004 2005 and 2006 upon emergence from bankruptcy all unrecognized prior service costs and actuarial losses will be recognized immediately thus eliminating the future amortization costs   valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we initially recorded a tax valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the third quarter of 2002 in recording the valuation allowance management considered whether it was more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets would be realized this analysis included consideration of scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income carryback potential and tax planning strategies in accordance with sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes at december 31 2003 our valuation allowance totaled 22 billion see also note 7 income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information   new accounting pronouncements   in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation 46 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 46 fin 46 requires the consolidation of variable interest entities vies as defined fin 46 is effective immediately for any interests acquired after january 31 2003 the related disclosure requirements are also effective immediately and are provided in note 17 commitments contingent liabilities and uncertainties in the notes to consolidated financial statements    in december 2003 the fasb issued interpretation 46r consolidation of variable interest entities revised december 2003 fin 46r which further clarified the provisions of fin 46 and delayed the effective date for applying the provisions of fin 46 until the end of the first quarter of 2004 for interests held by public entities in vies or potential vies created before february 1 2003 see note 2n summary of significant accounting policies  new accounting pronouncements in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more details on fin 46 and fin 46r and their impact on the company outlook   our 2003 results reflect significant reductions in expenses achieved through the restructuring process particularly in salaries and related costs and aircraftrelated expenses such as aircraft rent expense and depreciation and amortization we anticipate that our 2004 mainline unit cost will be lower than 2003 as we continue to benefit from our restructuring and business transformation initiatives we do not however expect total mainline expense to decline in 2004 versus 2003 to the same degree that was achieved in 2003 as compared to 2002 in addition upon emergence from bankruptcy we expect to adopt freshstart reporting in accordance with aicpa statement of position 907 financial reporting by entities in reorganization under the bankruptcy code which requires us to value our assets liabilities and equity at fair value we expect these changes will be material   certain statements throughout managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are forwardlooking and thus reflect the companys current expectations and beliefs with respect to certain current and future events and financial performance such forwardlooking statements are and will be as the case may be subject to many risks and uncertainties relating to our operations and business environment that may cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied in such forwardlooking statements factors that could significantly affect net earnings revenues expenses unit costs and profit improvements include without limitation the following our ability to continue as a going concern our ability to operate pursuant to the terms of the dip financing our ability to obtain a federal loan guarantee from the atsb our ability to obtain court approval with respect to motions in the chapter 11 proceeding prosecuted by us from time to time our ability to develop prosecute confirm and consummate one or more plans of reorganization with respect to the chapter 11 cases risks associated with third parties seeking and obtaining court approval to terminate or shorten our exclusive period to propose and confirm one or more plans of reorganization the potential adverse impact of the chapter 11 cases on our liquidity or results of operations the appointment of a chapter 11 trustee or conversion of the cases to chapter 7 the costs and availability of financing our ability to execute our business plan our ability to attract motivate andor retain key employees our ability to attract and retain customers demand for transportation in the markets in which we operate general economic conditions the effects of any hostilities or act of war or any terrorist attack the ability of other air carriers with whom we have alliances or partnerships to provide the services contemplated by the respective arrangements with such carriers the costs and availability of aircraft insurance the costs of aviation fuel the costs associated with security measures and practices competitive pressures on pricing particularly from lowercost competitors government legislation and regulation and other risks and uncertainties set forth from time to time in uals reports to the united states securities and exchange commission consequently the forwardlooking statements should not be regarded as representations or warranties by the company that such matters will be realized we disclaim any intent or obligation to update or revise any of the forwardlooking statements whether in response to new information unforeseen events changed circumstances or otherwise     


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   interest rate risk  uniteds exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to its debt obligations and shortterm investments we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio our policy is to manage interest rate risk through a combination of fixed and floating rate debt and entering into swap agreements depending upon market conditions a portion of the borrowings is denominated in foreign currencies which exposes us to risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates to hedge against some of this risk we have placed foreign currency deposits primarily for japanese yen and euros to meet foreign currency lease obligations designated in the respective currencies since unrealized marktomarket gains or losses on the foreign currency deposits are offset by the losses or gains on the foreign currency obligations we reduce our overall exposure to foreign currency exchange rate volatility the fair value of these deposits is determined based on the present value of future cash flows using an appropriate swap rate the fair value of longterm debt is based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or the present value of future cash flows using a us treasury rate that matches the remaining life of the instrument adjusted by a credit spread                





 item 9a controls and procedures   an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the companys management including the chief executive officer ceo and chief financial officer cfo of the effectiveness of the companys disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2003 based on that evaluation the companys management including the ceo and cfo has concluded that the companys disclosure controls and procedures are effective during the period covered by this report there was no change in the companys internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the companys internal control over financial reporting

foreclosure on substantial assets united needs to operate its business for more information on the dip financing see note 1 proceedings under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in the notes to consolidated financial statements    in order to exit chapter 11 successfully the company will need to propose and obtain confirmation by the bankruptcy court of a plan of reorganization that satisfies the requirements of the bankruptcy code a plan of reorganization would resolve among other things the debtors prepetition obligations set forth the revised capital structure of the newly reorganized entity and provide for its corporate governance subsequent to exit from bankruptcy on march 21 2003 the bankruptcy court approved the extension to october 2003 of the companys exclusivity period during which it is the only party permitted to file a plan of reorganization under certain circumstances the exclusivity period could be shortened by two months the timing of filing a plan of reorganization by the company will depend on the timing and outcome of numerous other ongoing matters in the chapter 11 cases although the company expects to file a plan of reorganization that provides for its emergence from bankruptcy as a going concern there can be no assurance at this time that a plan of reorganization will be confirmed by the bankruptcy court or that any such plan will be implemented successfully   under section 362 of the bankruptcy code the filing of a bankruptcy petition automatically stays most actions against a debtor including most actions to collect prepetition indebtedness or to exercise control over the property of the debtors estate absent an order of the bankruptcy court substantially all prepetition liabilities are subject to settlement under the plan of reorganization   notwithstanding the preceding general discussion of the automatic stay the debtors rights to possess and operate certain qualifying aircraft aircraft engines and other aircraftrelated equipment that are leased or subject to a security interest or conditional sale contract are governed by a particular provision of the bankruptcy code that specifies different treatment section 1110 of the bankruptcy code section 1110 provides that unless the debtors take certain action within 60 days after the petition date or such later date as is agreed by the applicable lessor secured party or conditional vendor the contractual rights of such financier to take possession of such equipment and to enforce any of its other rights or remedies under the applicable agreement are not limited or otherwise affected by the automatic stay or any other provision of the bankruptcy code for more information on section 1110 see properties  flight equipment under item 2 below and note 1 proceedings under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in the notes to consolidated financial statements   under section 365 of the bankruptcy code the debtors may assume assume and assign or reject certain executory contracts and unexpired leases including leases of real property aircraft and aircraft engines subject to the approval of the bankruptcy court and certain other conditions in general rejection of an unexpired lease or executory contract is treated as a prepetition breach of the lease or contract in question subject to certain exceptions this rejection relieves the debtors of performing their future obligations under that lease or contract but entitles the lessor or contract counterparty to a prepetition general unsecured claim for damages caused by the deemed breach   counterparties to these rejected contracts or leases may file proofs of claim against the debtors estate for such damages due to the uncertain nature of many of the potential rejection and abandonment related claims the company is unable to project the magnitude of these claims with any degree of certainty at this time   generally the assumption of an executory contract or unexpired lease requires a debtor to cure most existing defaults under such executory contract or unexpired lease   the bankruptcy code provides special treatment for collective bargaining agreements cbas in particular section 1113c of the bankruptcy code permits the company to move to reject its collective bargaining agreements if the company first satisfies a number of statutorily prescribed substantive and procedural prerequisites and obtains the bankruptcy courts approval of the rejection after bargaining in good faith and sharing relevant information with its unions the debtor must make proposals to modify its existing cbas based on the most complete and reliable information available at the time the proposed modifications must be necessary to permit the reorganization of the debtor and must ensure that all the affected parties are treated fairly and equitably relative to the creditors and the debtor ultimately rejection is appropriate if the unions refuse to agree to the debtors necessary proposals without good cause and the balance of the equities favors rejection see employees  labor matters below under this item 1 and labor matters under managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation    the united states trustee for the northern district of illinois the us trustee has appointed an official committee of unsecured creditors the creditors committee the creditors committee and its legal representatives have a right to be heard on all matters that come before the bankruptcy court there can be no assurance that the creditors committee will support the debtors positions or the debtors ultimate plan of reorganization once proposed and disagreements between the debtors and the creditors committee could protract the chapter 11 cases could negatively impact the debtors ability to operate during the chapter 11 cases and could prevent the debtors emergence from chapter 11   at this time it is not possible to predict accurately the effect of the chapter 11 reorganization process on the companys business or when it may emerge from chapter 11 the companys future results depend on the timely and successful confirmation and implementation of a plan of reorganization the rights and claims of various creditors and security holders will be determined by the plan as well no assurance can be given as to what values if any will be ascribed in the bankruptcy proceedings to each of these constituencies and it is possible that uals equity or other securities will be restructured in a manner that will reduce substantially or eliminate any remaining value accordingly the company urges that appropriate caution be exercised with respect to existing and future investments in any of such securities and claims   on february 24 2003 the bankruptcy court entered a preliminary injunction in order to restrict the trading of the companys common stock and debt interests in the company the purpose of the preliminary injunction was to ensure that the company did not lose the benefit of its net operating loss nol under federal and state income tax law an nol can be used to offset future taxable income and thus is an extremely valuable asset however a company can lose the benefit of its nols if the company is deemed to undergo an ownership change under certain very specific tax rules in the internal revenue code excessive trading in a companys stock or debt when the company is in bankruptcy can trigger such an ownership change and thus the company sought to restrict the trading of the companys common stock and debt interests   under the terms of the preliminary injunction no person can buy or sell ual stock if that person holds more than 48 million shares of ual common stock or would hold more than 48 million shares after the purchase any person who holds more than 200 million in debt claims against ual must register as a substantial claimholder with ual and no person may acquire debt claims against ual if the acquisition of the claims would cause them to hold more than 200 million in such claims see note 7 income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements  plan for transformation   central to uals reorganization and emergence from chapter 11 is its plan for transformation which outlines the fundamental changes to uniteds strategic direction the plan which the company seeks to refine through further collaboration with its employee and creditor constituencies is intended to lay the foundation for a company that is successful and competitive for the long run core objectives of the plan are the reduction of uniteds labor and nonlabor costs and the development of a more comprehensive and compelling portfolio of products key operational elements of the plan include 1 the preservation and enhancement of uniteds extensive mainline service targeted primarily at the business traveler 2 the creation of a lowcost offering to compete directly with lowcost carriers for leisure and pricesensitive travelers 3 the growth of the companys united express regional operations and 4 the expansion of uniteds domestic and international alliances see other

responsible for certain aspects of it including member relationships communications and account management while united continues to be responsible for the elite frequent flyer aspects of the program including the premier premier executive and premier executive 1k programs as well as the air travel accrual and award aspects of the program united also retains responsibility for managing the relationship with mileage plus airline partners while uls manages relationships with nonairline business partners such as the mileage plus visa card hotels car rental companies and dining programs uls also owns and operates certain other unitedbranded customer programs as well as the mypointscom online loyalty program under which registered consumers earn points for goods and services purchased from participating vendors   united cargo ®    united cargo offers both domestic and international shipping through its small package delivery td guaranteed first freight international freight ua 2day service and united sameday freight accounts for most of united cargos shipments while mail remains an important component of uniteds cargo strategy   for the year 2002 united cargo generated approximately 673 million in freight and mail revenue which represents a 44 decrease versus 2001 traffic has gradually improved but volumes remain below preseptember 11 2001 levels   in august 2002 united cargo opened a new cargo warehouse facility in chicago which is presently the largest facility for processing freight and mail in north america this completes united cargos planned investment in facilities   in january of 2003 united cargo along with unisys corporation and two other cargo carriers launched cargo portal services an internet portal that allows freight forwarders to book and manage shipments more easily through the delivery cycle by providing enhanced computerbased communications between customers and air carriers united expects cargo portal services to reduce transaction costs for both united and its customers   fuel   fuel is uniteds second largest cost behind labor the companys fuel costs and consumption for the years 2002 2001 and 2000 were as follows      the price and availability of jet fuel significantly affect uniteds operations based on projected 2003 fuel consumption the company estimates that every 001 change in the average annual pricepergallon of jet fuel will impact uniteds 2003 fuel costs by approximately 21 million absent any fuel hedging arrangements due to the highly competitive nature of the airline industry united may be unable to pass on to its customers any increased fuel costs that it may encounter   to help mitigate against price increases united in the past has entered into hedging arrangements in 2002 united hedged 26 of its fuel consumption using crude oil and heating oil swaps united had also put in place hedges for 7 of its estimated fuel consumption for the first half of 2003 the impact of these hedges is included in the total fuel cost shown above however as a result of the filing of the chapter 11 cases the derivatives counterparties terminated all outstanding swap contracts leaving united completely unhedged as market conditions and its economic outlook change the company continually evaluates the potential economic benefit of entering into fuel hedging arrangements   to ensure adequate supplies of fuel and to provide a measure of control over fuel costs united ships fuel on major pipelines and stores fuel close to its major hub locations although the company currently does not anticipate a significant reduction in the availability of jet fuel a number of factors make accurate predictions impossible including geopolitical uncertainties in oilproducing nations for example hostilities in iraq could lead to disruptions in oil production andor to substantially increased oil prices the continuing political turmoil in venezuela also could have similar effects   insurance   united carries hull and liability insurance of a type customary in the air transportation industry in amounts which it deems adequate covering passenger liability public liability and damage to uniteds aircraft and other physical property however as a result of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks the premiums have increased significantly   additionally after september 11 2001 commercial insurers cancelled uniteds liability insurance for losses resulting from war perils terrorism sabotage hijacking and other similar perils but united obtained replacement coverage through the faa under the homeland security act which became effective in february 2003 the faa is authorized to offer this insurance through august 31 2003 and it may be extended to december 31 2003 if the federal government determines such an extension is in the national interest likewise united maintains hull war risk insurance through the faa program which provides worldwide coverage for war and associated perils including hijacking and confiscation there can be no assurance however that the faa insurance will continue to be available should the faa discontinue this coverage obtaining it from commercial underwriters could result in substantially higher premiums and more restrictive terms if it is available at all   also united maintains other types of insurance such as property and casualty directors and officers cargo automobile and the like with limits and deductibles that are standard within the industry compared to insurance prior to september 11 the premiums are substantially higher with lower limits   civil reserve air fleet program   in time of war or certain other national emergencies the us government can require united and other major air carriers to provide airlift services to the us military under the civil reserve air fleet program craf on february 8 2003 the us government activated craf for only the second time since the program was established in 1951 because the us militarys airlift needs exceeded the militarys capabilities in connection with the buildup of troops in the middle east as a result united along with other us commercial airlines is currently participating in the transportation of troops and cargo to the middle east while uniteds participation in the craf program to date has had a positive impact on uniteds profitability should united be required to provide a more substantial amount of these services for an extended period its business could be adversely impacted conflict with iraq   in anticipation of the us conflict with iraq united conducted extensive contingency preparations and developed a plan to address the likely effects on the airline industry as a whole and on united in particular with the initiation of the military campaign on march 19 2003 united implemented that plan which included an immediate reduction in capacity of 8 effective april 6 2003 and placing a number of employees on temporary unpaid leave   in addition united has been working with other carriers major labor unions and the air transport association a trade association of major us airlines to develop and propose a comprehensive government assistance package for the carriers potential components could include relief from certain taxes the payment by the federal government of all costs for airport security opening up the strategic oil reserve and governmentprovided terrorism insurance for the airlines at this time it is impossible to assess the prospects of such legislation and there can be no assurance that congress or the president will approve this or any other relief for the industry   further if other relief is insufficient or is unavailable on a timely basis the company may seek to implement additional temporary wage reductions for all employees marketing strategy   united seeks to attract customers and create customer preference for united by providing a comprehensive network an attractive frequent flyer program and enhanced and differentiated product and service offerings   alliances   united has entered into a number of bilateral and multilateral alliances with other airlines to provide its customers more choices and to participate in markets worldwide that it does not serve directly these collaborative marketing arrangements typically include one or more of the following features joint frequent flyer participation code sharing of flight operations whereby one carriers flights can be marketed under the twoletter airline designator code of another carrier coordination of reservations baggage handling and flight schedules and other resourcesharing activities   the most significant of these is the star alliance Ô  a global integrated airline network cofounded by united in 1997 as of december 31 2002 star alliance carriers served approximately 727 destinations in approximately 125 countries with approximately 10622 daily flights current star alliance partners in addition to united are air canada air new zealand all nippon airways asiana austrian airlines bmi lauda air lufthansa mexicana sas singapore airways thai international airways tyrolean and varig two additional carriers are expected to join in 2003 spanair as of april 1 and lot polish airlines as of october 26 united currently holds bilateral antitrust immunity with air canada and integrated antitrust immunity with lufthansa sas and the austrian airlines group which includes austrian airlines lauda air and tyrolean united has limited antitrust immunity with bmi subject to completion of an open skies agreement between the us and uk for more information on open skies and international rights see government regulation in this item 1   in july 2002 united announced the development of a marketing partnership with us airways to include joint frequent flyer participation joint lounge access and code sharing on certain flights currently united and us airways have substantially implemented the first two of those arrangements the carriers currently code share on selected flights and expect to complete the implementation of the code sharing element of the partnership by the end of 2003 subject to certain conditions imposed by the us government on august 11 2002 us airways and certain subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code that case is still pending before the bankruptcy court although us airways has filed a plan of reorganization that has been approved by its creditors and confirmed by the bankruptcy court and that provides for its emergence from bankruptcy as a going concern there can be no assurance that such plan will be implemented successfully if us airways is unable to emerge as a going concern or if it emerges as a significantly smaller or different company the anticipated benefits to united of the marketing partnership may never materialize and uniteds business may suffer   united has also formed independent marketing agreements with other air carriers including aloha bwia west indies airways continental connection operated by gulfstream great lakes airlines a regional carrier and spanair united continually evaluates the need for relationships with these and other carriers and from time to time will change its independent marketing partners as conditions warrant   in addition united operates the united express ® marketing program in north america under which independent regional carriers serve small and mediumsized cities and link them to uniteds mainline network united express carriers are air wisconsin airlines atlantic coast airlines and sky west airlines on february 27 2003 united announced that it had entered into an agreement with mesa air group inc pursuant to which mesa air will become a united express carrier on western routes as part of the chapter 11 process the company is reevaluating each of the contracts with the three existing united express carriers and may renegotiate or reject any of these agreements in connection with its reorganization   mileage plus   the mileage plus frequent flyer program was established to develop passenger loyalty by offering awards and services to frequent travelers more than 40 million members have enrolled in mileage plus since it began in 1981 mileage plus members earn mileage credit for flights on united united express the star alliance carriers and certain other airlines that participate in the program miles also can be earned by purchasing the goods and services of nonairline program participants such as hotels car rental companies and credit card issuers mileage credits can be redeemed for free discounted or upgraded travel and nontravel awards for a detailed description of the treatment of mileage plus awards see critical accounting policies in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations    distribution channels   the overwhelming majority of uniteds airline inventory continues to be distributed through the traditional channels of travel agencies and global distribution systems gds the us department of transportation dot has issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that could significantly change the rules under which carriers deal with the gds these new rules are expected to be finalized in january 2004   united uses the apollo reservation system which is hosted by galileo international the hosting agreement with galileo continues through 2004 industry conditions   operating environment   the air travel business is subject to seasonal fluctuations uniteds operations can be adversely impacted by winter weather and uniteds first and fourthquarter results normally reflect reduced travel demand historically operating results are better in the second and third quarters the events of september 11 2001 and the recession in the us economy distorted the normal seasonal relationships in 2001 and 2002 as a result of the us war with iraq the typical seasonal fluctuations may continue to be disrupted in 2003   competition   the airline industry is highly competitive in domestic markets new and existing carriers are free to initiate service on any route uniteds domestic competitors include all of the other major us airlines as well as regional carriers most of which have lower cost structures than united recently three of uniteds largest competitors delta airlines continental airlines and northwest airlines have given notice of their intention to implement a comprehensive code sharing arrangement subject to certain regulatory approval the successful introduction of this arrangement or of other comparable arrangements by other carriers likely will further intensify domestic competition   in its international service united competes not only with us airlines but also with foreign carriers uniteds competition on specified international routes is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulations see government regulation united has advantages over foreign air carriers in the us because of its ability to generate us origindestination traffic from its integrated domestic route systems and because foreign carriers are prohibited by us law from carrying local passengers between two points in the us united experiences comparable restrictions in foreign countries in addition us carriers are often constrained from carrying passengers to points beyond designated international gateway cities due to limitations in air service agreements or restrictions imposed unilaterally by foreign governments to compensate for these structural limitations us and foreign carriers have entered into alliances and marketing arrangements that allow the carriers to provide traffic feed to each others flights see marketing strategy  alliances government regulation   domestic regulation   all carriers engaged in air transportation in the us are subject to regulation by the dot among its responsibilities the dot has authority to issue certificates of public convenience and necessity for domestic air transportation grant international route authorities approve international code share agreements regulate methods of competition and enforce certain consumer protection regulations such as those dealing with advertising denied boarding compensation and baggage liability   airlines are also regulated by the faa primarily in the areas of flight operations maintenance and other safety and technical matters the faa has authority to issue air carrier operating certificates and aircraft airworthiness certificates prescribe maintenance procedures and regulate pilot and other employee training among other responsibilities the faa also administers the us airtraffic control system from time to time the faa issues rules that require air carriers to take certain actions such as the inspection or modification of aircraft and other equipment that may cause united to incur substantial unplanned expenses   from time to time the company is subject to inquiries by these and other us and international regulatory bodies the company does not believe that any such existing inquiries will have a material effect on its business   access to landing and takeoff rights or slots at four us airports historically has been subject to government regulation at these airports ohare international in chicago john f kennedy international and laguardia in new york and reagan national in washington dc the faa has regulated the number of available slots the wendell h ford aviation investment and reform act for the 21st century enacted in april of 2000 eliminated all slot restrictions at ohare in july of 2002 and called for the elimination of slot restrictions at kennedy and laguardia by 2007 the eliminations to date have not had and the planned eliminations are not expected to have a material effect on the company   international regulation internationally the company is subject to the aviation authorities of the foreign countries that united serves these authorities may from time to time impose regulations beyond those that apply to uniteds domestic operations   historically access to foreign markets has been tightly controlled through bilateral treaties regulating the number of points served the number of carriers and the frequencies of flights more recently the us has pursued a policy of open skies under which the us government has negotiated a number of bilateral agreements allowing unrestricted access to foreign markets while a considerable number of foreign governments have agreed to open skies several major markets remain subject to restrictive bilateral agreements among them are london and tokyo where united has significant operations further uniteds ability to serve some countries and its expansion into certain others is limited by the absence altogether of aviation agreements between the us and the relevant governments shifts in us or foreign government aviation policies can lead to the alteration or termination of air service agreements between the us and other countries these changes could diminish the value of uniteds international route authority because changes in these agreements could curtail or terminate uniteds international rights in the associated markets   during 2002 united sought to expand its access to and presence in asia in response to uniteds application for additional frequencies under newly negotiated rights in the ushong kong bilateral agreement the dot awarded united rights that will allow united to operate a second daily hong kongtokyo flight united also was awarded an additional code share frequency to serve vietnam which brings the carriers current pool of vietnam code share frequencies to eight although vietnam holds significant commercial potential the absence of an air service treaty between the united states and vietnam prohibits us carriers from serving this market directly   the air services agreement between the us and japan provides an unlimited number of frequencies to certain carriers including united united also holds significant traffic rights from japan to other locations within the pacific these rights and the 2002 opening of tokyos narita airports second runway provided united with the opportunity to add service in 2002 between tokyo and taipei   in connection with its international services united is required to make regular filings with the dot and in some cases to observe rules establishing the tariffs charged and service provided in some cases fares and schedules also require the approval of the relevant foreign governments   the european union the eu is taking an increasingly active role in regulating international aviation in october of 2002 the european commission granted antitrust immunity subject to certain conditions to united lufthansa and sas   in november 2002 the european court of justice issued a ruling that invalidated certain provisions of aviation agreements between the us and the eu the governments are committed to ensuring that this ruling does not interrupt existing air service this decision paves the way for the eu to negotiate aviation treaties on behalf of eu member states with other noneu countries   the european commission continues its attempts to modify the existing regulation that governs slots at eu airports the most recent proposal if accepted would have the effect of favoring eu airlines and would dramatically alter the manner in which eu slots are held and allocated the proposed changes threaten to redefine the issue of slot ownership and impede the selling and trading of slots   starting in late 2001 and continuing through march 24 2002 airport authorities and other regulatory bodies granted united and other international slot holders shortterm waivers from an international rule that ordinarily requires a carrier to forfeit any slot that it uses less than 80 of the time in any season separately the dot waived through march 31 2002 its requirement that us carriers in limitedentry international markets return to the dot frequencies in those markets that they do not use more than 90 days in light of the current conflict with iraq united and other carriers are seeking comparable waivers of the slot and frequencyofuse requirements from domestic and international regulatory bodies and airport authorities   legislation   the air transportation safety and system stabilization act of 2001 the stabilization act established the federal air transportation stabilization board atsb and made 5 billion in federal grants and 10 billion in loan guarantees conditionally available to the airline industry the legislation also provides relief from increased insurance premiums caps potential liability from the september 11 terrorist attacks limits liability for any future terrorist events and creates a federal compensation fund for attack victims in 2001 and 2002 united received 782 million in grants on june 24 2002 ual submitted an application to the atsb for a loan guarantee in connection with a contemplated financing after discussions with the atsb and subsequent revision to the application on december 4 2002 the atsb informed the company that it had not approved the application notwithstanding the denial of the companys application for a prepetition loan guaranty ual has been continuing to work with the atsb toward the possible funding of a loan that would provide financing to the company upon its exit from bankruptcy   separate legislation enacted in november 2001 the aviation and transportation security act the aviation act has had wideranging effects on uniteds operations the aviation act makes the federal government responsible for virtually all aspects of security that united has traditionally provided the aviation act created a new government agency the tsa responsible for aviation security notably the aviation act required that the security screener workforce be composed entirely of federal employees by november 2002 regulations under the aviation act also require carriers to charge passengers in the us a security fee of 250 per enplanement capped at 1000 per round trip and to remit that fee to the dot the dot as provided in the aviation act also has assessed an additional fee equal to the amount paid by carriers for security screening in the year 2000 directly on air carriers to compensate for the costs of screening activities and property the aviation act mandates numerous additional security measures including that as of december 31 2002 all checked baggage be screened by explosive detection systems   privacy laws an initiative of significant impact within the eu and elsewhere is the introduction of privacy standards that apply to companies transmitting private information from the eu to noneu countries to comply with the privacy directives the us commerce department and the eu have agreed to safe harbor principles although the safe harbor principles are voluntary at this time united plans to comply with them the us commerce department and the eu continue to review the status of voluntary compliance   canada argentina and australia have enacted new privacy laws covering the collection and disclosure of personally identifiable information these laws may have an impact on the way united collects and transmits personally identifiable information in these jurisdictions   environmental regulations   the company like others in the airline industry is subject to federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning emissions to the air discharges to surface and subsurface waters safe drinking water and the management of hazardous substances oils and waste materials the company and the industry are also subject to other environmental laws and regulations including those that require the company to remediate soil or groundwater to meet certain objectives it is the companys policy to comply with all environmental laws and regulations which can require expenditures the company also conducts voluntary remediation actions these costs are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the business   under the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known as superfund and similar environmental cleanup laws waste generators can be subject to liability for investigation and remediation costs at disposal sites that have been identified as requiring response actions the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party by a governmental unit or private party at certain sites that could result in future expenditures including the mattiace petrochemical superfund site the approved oil superfund site the chemsol inc superfund site and the gibson environmental inc superfund site   there is a dispute primarily among united american and ogden services as well as northwest airlines and delta concerning the responsibility for payment of certain clean up costs for groundwater and soil contamination near terminals 8 and 9 at new yorks jfk airport the parties views on proper allocation of the costs differ this litigation which was initiated in 2000 in the supreme court of the state of new york is currently stayed because of the bankruptcy   the miami international airport has been conducting a longterm project to investigate and remediate soil and groundwater contamination at the airport recently the miami international airport has identified a multitude of current and former tenants it believes should help pay for these remedial measures and united is one of these tenants while the airport initiated a lawsuit in 2001 against a handful of potentially responsible parties united is not one of the parties named in the lawsuit   in accordance with a june 1999 order issued by the california regional water quality control board crwqcb united along with most of the other tenants of the san francisco international airport has been investigating potential environmental contamination at the airport and conducting remediation when needed among these projects is an investigation and remediation project for solvent impacts to soil and groundwater at the san francisco maintenance center this project is being conducted in accordance with crwqcb approvals   in august 2002 the company entered into a settlement with the us epa to address voluntarily disclosed clean air act violations associated with the requirement that lowsulfur diesel fuel be used in certain ground support equipment this settlement involves a penalty payment and performance of a supplemental environmental project involving the replacement of some older ground support equipment with new electricpowered equipment   the us epa and the state of california are seeking penalties and potentially injunctive relief from the company for alleged noncompliance with hazardous waste generator requirements at uniteds san francisco maintenance center identified in 1999 and 2001 the company has been working with both governmental entities to resolve this matter   in addition to the matters discussed above from time to time the company becomes aware of potential noncompliance with environmental regulations which have either been identified by the company through its internal environmental compliance auditing program or through a governmental entity in some instances these matters could potentially become the subject of an administrative or judicial proceeding and could potentially involve monetary sanctions of 100000 or more   the company does not expect these matters individually or collectively to have a material adverse effect on the company employees  labor matters   as of march 1 2003 the company and its subsidiaries had approximately 72000 employees of which approximately 80 are represented by various labor organizations this number represents a significant reduction from the end of 2001 when the company and its subsidiaries had approximately 84000 employees this reduction was a direct response to the continuing adverse impact on air travel resulting from the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks reduced demand for air travel in general as well as uniteds concerted efforts to reduce costs   the employee groups number of employees labor organization and current contract status for each of uniteds collective bargaining groups as of february 28 2003 were as follows      collective bargaining agreements cbas are negotiated under the railway labor act which governs labor relations in the transportation industry and typically do not contain an expiration date instead they specify an amendable date upon which the contract is considered open for amendment prior to the amendable date neither party is required to agree to modifications to the bargaining agreement nevertheless nothing prevents the parties from agreeing to start negotiations or to modify the agreement in advance of the amendable date contracts remain in effect while new agreements are negotiated during the negotiating period both the company and the negotiating union are required to maintain the status quo   in order to meet the earnings covenant under the dip financing united needed to obtain substantial labor savings from its employees by midfebruary 2003 therefore the company imposed immediate wage reductions on its management and salaried employees including officers in december 2002 additionally united immediately began negotiations with all of its unions in early december regarding the changes to the companys cbas necessary to satisfy uniteds shortterm and longterm financial and business imperatives   in the event the parties cannot reach consensual modifications section 1113c of the bankruptcy code permits the company to move to reject its cbas under section 1113c the company must satisfy several statutorily prescribed substantive and procedural prerequisites before the bankruptcy court will authorize the company to reject its cbas in order to meet the deadline imposed by the dip financing covenants for reducing its labor costs united had been prepared to file a motion to reject its cbas pursuant to section 1113c of the bankruptcy code by december 26 2002 if consensual cba modifications could not be reached before that date   as the december 26 deadline neared however united and several of its unions agreed to consensual interim wage relief from its unions that would allow united and its unions more time to continue negotiations to reach agreements on the cba modifications necessary for united to reorganize successfully while still meeting the shortterm financial imperatives established by the dip covenants united reached agreements with four of its five unions to reduce wages on an interim basis effective january 1 2003 to april 30 2003 the leadership of the iam rejected the companys proposal and therefore on december 27 2002 united filed a motion with the bankruptcy court to impose a wage reduction for the iamrepresented employees on january 10 2003 the bankruptcy court granted the companys motion  1   the collective bargaining agreement between the company and the afa provides for negotiated midterm wage adjustments     under the terms of the interim agreements with its unions and the relief granted by the bankruptcy court against the iam united agreed not to file a motion to reject its cbas pursuant to section 1113c before march 15 2003 in the meantime united and its unions continued negotiations the companys dip covenants however still require united to obtain all of the relief sought in its proposed cba modifications by may 1 2003 as a result on march 17 2003 united filed a motion to reject its cbas pursuant to section 1113c and the bankruptcy court has scheduled hearings on this motion for april 14 march 17 was the deadline by which such a motion needed to be filed to ensure that the company could obtain a ruling on its motion by early may 2003 and stay in compliance with its dip financing covenants   on march 26 2003 the company reached a tentative agreement with the air line pilots association international alpa on a restructured cba the agreement which will become effective may 1 2003 if ratified by the pilot membership has a 6year duration and would reduce pay and benefits and improve productivity through work rule changes by an average of approximately 11 billion per year versus the current contract as part of these changes retirement and medical benefits for pilots would be reduced through a decrease in the companys contribution to the pilot defined contribution plan a reduction in the formula for their defined benefit plan and changes to the medical plan including increases to copayments   the tentative agreement includes a successsharing program that provides the opportunity for annual payouts tied to the companys level of profitability and performance the tentative agreement provides for significantly enhanced flexibility with respect to regional jets code share arrangements and a lowcost offering finally the company has agreed to include in its plan of reorganization provisions that pilots would receive a distribution of the equity securities or other consideration provided to the general unsecured creditors additionally the company had agreed that any plan of reorganization it proposes or supports will provide the pilot group with a distribution of the abovedescribed equity securities or other consideration as compared to the total distribution provided to all employee groups which matches the proportion of pilots contribution to total employee cost reductions   the pilot contribution in the tentative agreement represents a significant portion of the overall labor cost reductions sought by the company should the company be unable to obtain labor cost reductions from any of its union groups through consensual agreements or otherwise which fall below the relief the company has articulates as necessary from that group the company has agreed to proportionately reduce alpas approximate 11 billion contribution   for additional information on labor negotiations see other information  labor agreements in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results

 item 2 properties flight equipment   as of december 31 2002 uniteds operating aircraft fleet totaled 567 jet aircraft of which 267 were owned and 300 were leased these aircraft are listed below      as of december 31 2002 all 267 of the aircraft owned by united were encumbered under debt agreements for additional information on accounting for these aircraft see note 12 longterm debt and note 13 lease obligations in the notes to consolidated financial statements    united has on firm order with the manufacturers 42 airbus a319100 and a320200 and one boeing 777200 aircraft the company is evaluating these contracts in light of its financial condition and operational requirements   in connection with the companys bankruptcy reorganization under chapter 11 united is reassessing its fleet requirements and is seeking to reduce significantly its aircraft financing costs central to this undertaking is the companys effort to readjust lease and mortgage payments for aircraft whose fair market values have fallen since the execution of the original agreements united is negotiating with a significant number of its aircraft lenders and lessors to restructure the underlying financings to reflect current market rates although the company has reached agreements in principle with respect to a number of aircraft there can be no assurance that those tentative arrangements will be successfully converted to final contracts or that other comparable arrangements will be available to the company to the extent united is unable to reach final agreements at economically attractive terms for the requisite number of aircraft its financial and operational performance may be adversely affected   under section 1110 of the bankruptcy code the automatic stay lasts for only 60 days with respect to section 1110eligible aircraft engines and related equipment except under two conditions the debtor may extend the 60day period by agreement of the relevant financier with court approval alternatively the debtor may agree to perform all of the obligations under the applicable financing and cure any defaults thereunder as required by the bankruptcy code in the absence of either such arrangement the financier may take possession of the property and enforce any of its contractual rights or remedies to sell lease or otherwise retain or dispose of such equipment   the 60day period under section 1110 in uals chapter 11 case expired on february 7 2003 the company has reached agreements with a significant number of aircraft financiers to extend the automatic stay in exchange in certain instances for uniteds agreement to make specified payments united also has made elections with respect to certain other aircraft to cure all existing defaults and to pay the contract rates as required by the bankruptcy code with respect to certain aircraft however united neither negotiated an extension of the automatic stay nor agreed to cure and resume payments accordingly the financiers of such aircraft may seek to repossess the property although no such financiers have sought to repossess any united equipment and although the company believes that market conditions for commercial aircraft make repossession unlikely there can be no assurance that uals lenders and lessors will not repossess any of the applicable aircraft any such repossessions could result in substantial disruptions to uniteds operations and could have a material adverse effect on the companys business   for more information on section 1110 see note 1 proceedings under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in the notes to consolidated financial statements ground facilities   united has entered into various leases relating to its use of airport landing areas gates hangar sites terminal buildings and other airport facilities in most of the municipalities it serves major leases expire at san francisco in 2003 and 2011 oakland in 2007 washingtondulles in 2014 chicago ohare in 2018 los angeles in 2021 denver in 2025 and indianapolis in 2031 united intends to exercise its rights under the 2003 san francisco lease by extending the term until 2013 pursuant to a 10year renewal option united owns a 106acre complex in suburban chicago consisting of more than 1000000 square feet of office space for its world headquarters a computer facility and a training center united also owns a flight training center located in the city and county of denver that can accommodate 36 flight simulators and more than 90 computerbased training stations both the chicago and denver facilities are fully mortgaged united owns a limited number of other properties including a reservations facility and an office building in denver and a crew hotel in honolulu hawaii all of these facilities are fully mortgaged   uniteds maintenance operation center at san francisco international airport occupies 129 acres of land 3000000 square feet of floor space and 12 aircraft hangar docks under a lease expiring in 2003 with an option to extend for 10 years united intends to exercise its rights under the lease agreement by extending the term until 2013 pursuant to the renewal option uniteds indianapolis maintenance center a major aircraft maintenance and overhaul facility is operated under a lease with the indianapolis airport authority that expires in 2031 the indianapolis maintenance center occupies 300 acres of land 1690000 square feet of floor space and 12 aircraft hangar docks united also leases a major facility at the oakland california airport dedicated to widebody airframe maintenance the oakland facility occupies 44 acres of land 380000 square feet of floor space and has four aircraft hangar docks   uniteds offairport leased properties have included a number of ticketing sales and general office space in the downtown and outlying areas of most of the larger cities comprised in the united system as part of its restructuring and cost containment efforts united has closed terminated or rejected all of its city ticket office leases united continues to lease and operate a number of general office reservations sales and other support facilities   at december 31 2002 approximately 17 billion in special facilities revenue bonds municipal bonds originally issued on behalf of united to build or improve airportrelated facilities were outstanding the company leases facilities at airports pursuant to lease agreements where municipal bonds funded at least some of its airportrelated projects pursuant to the financing agreements entered into by united in connection with such issuance of municipal bonds the company is required to make payments in amounts sufficient to pay the interest semiannually with principal payable upon maturity   united is not permitted under the bankruptcy code to make payments on unsecured prepetition debt without providing notice to its creditors and receiving the approval of the bankruptcy court as united has been advised its municipal bonds are unsecured or in certain instances partially secured prepetition debt united cannot make payments thereon without first meeting the requirements outlined aboveaccordingly the company has classified all of its municipal bonds as liabilities subject to compromise   section 365 of the bankruptcy code requires that the company timely perform all of its postpetition obligations under unexpired leases of nonresidential real property the company believes that it is in compliance with all payment obligations under its lease agreements relating to those airports where it has municipal bonds outstanding under certain of the airport lease agreements however the company may be considered in default due to the nonpayment of the debt and therefore subject to the default provisions of the lease agreements with the airports possible consequences could include loss of the companys status as a signatory airline resulting in increased rents and landing fees and loss of the companys exclusive space agreement   the company did not pay certain rental and landing fees when first due on december 1 2002 under its airport use agreement with the city of chicago with respect to the chicago ohare international airport by letter to the company dated december 4 2002 corporation counsel for the city of chicago asserted that the company may have forfeited its exclusive rights to its premises at ohare on account of the companys nonpayment of such rental and landing fees by letter to corporation counsel for the city of chicago on december 5 2002 the company confirmed that it had paid by wire transfer on december 5 2002 the full payment of outstanding rental and landing fee obligations at ohare and that such payment constituted a cure of any delinquency or default and that the companys rights under such lease remain unaffected likewise by letter to corporation counsel for the city of chicago on december 6 2002 the company reiterated its position that the december 5 th payment represented a cure of any rental delinquencies or defaults and that the citys attempt to modify the companys exclusive rights was ineffective a difference of opinion remains as to whether the city of chicagos attempt to change the exclusive nature of the premises at ohare has any legal effect   the company did not make the debt service payments due march 1 2003 of approximately 32 million on its chicago ohare series 1999a bonds and of approximately 10 million on its miamidade series 2000 bonds additionally the company does not intend to make debt service payments or any other payment due on or after april 1 2003 on any of the municipal bond issuances which include those referenced above issued on behalf of the company and relating to domestic airport financings   the company filed a complaint of debtor for declaratory judgment with the bankruptcy court on february 28 2003 and entered into a standstill agreement with the city of chicago to seek clarification of its obligations under the municipal bonds and to protect its rights under its airport lease agreement at chicagos ohare international airport until the bankruptcy court decides the merits of the complaint   on march 21 2003 the company filed other complaints of debtor for declaratory judgment and in connection therewith corresponding motions for temporary restraining order with respect to the municipal bonds issuances relating to the facilities at the denver international airport the new york city  john f kennedy international airport the san francisco international airport and the los angeles international airport each seeking a clarification of the companys obligations under the applicable municipal bonds and the protection of its rights under its underlying airport lease agreements at the applicable airport until the bankruptcy court decides the merits of each of the above complaints on march 27 the bankruptcy court conducted a hearing on this issue at that time the court continued the hearing until march 31 2003 and the parties are attempting to negotiate an order that would protect the companys rights under its leases by requiring the lessors to give additional notice of certain alleged defaults the company is unable to predict what if any action might be taken in the future by either the bondholders or the airport authorities as a result of its failure to pay these obligations as contractually required

outcome of the chapter 11 cases or their effect on the companys business summers v ual corporation esop et al   the ual corporation esop and the esop committee were sued on february 28 2003 by certain esop participants in a purported class action that alleges that the esop committee breached its fiduciary duty by not selling ual stock held by the esop from july 19 2001 to the present the complaint

addition the appellate court reversed the dismissal of all individual class representative claims of discrimination and the case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings uniteds petition before the us supreme court was rejected prior to uniteds chapter 11 filing the parties settled the case to enable plaintiffs to establish the size of their unsecured claim the automatic stay resulting from uniteds chapter 11 filing will be lifted to allow the court to conduct proceedings to allow the finalization of the settlement as to the class hall dba travel specialists v united   a

violation of the sherman act and seek treble damages and injunctive relief subsequent to this initial filing the case has been expanded by the addition of five new travel agencies arta and eight new carrier defendants including two star alliance carriers in addition the court has allowed the addition of claims related to carriers commission reduction actions in 1997 1998 2001 and 2002 earlier this year the court granted plaintiffs motion to certify the case as a class action consisting of all us and its possessions travel agencies plaintiffs have claimed lost commissions assuming liability

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations    chapter 11 reorganization   on december 9 2002 the debtors filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of illinois eastern division in chicago for further details regarding the bankruptcy filing see bankruptcy considerations under item 1   on the petition date the bankruptcy court gave interim approval for an aggregate of up to 15 billion in dip financing the dip financing is structured as a 300 million facility from bank one na the bank one facility and a 12 billion facility provided by a group led by jpmorgan chase bank citicorp usa inc bank one na and the cit groupbusiness credit inc the club facility the company has received commitments of 10 billion under the club facility following the completion of the syndication process for that facility the balance is conditioned upon the participation of one or more additional lenders subject to approval by the existing participants the company currently has access to the entire bank one facility and to 500 million of the club facility access to the balance of the club facility is subject to specified terms of that facility these terms require that the company achieve performance milestones under its business plan which include substantial cost savings in the near term final approval of the dip financing was granted by the bankruptcy court on december 30 2002 for more information on the dip financing see note 1 proceedings under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in the notes to consolidated financial statements    in order to successfully exit chapter 11 the company will need to propose and obtain confirmation by the bankruptcy court of a plan of reorganization that satisfies the requirements of the bankruptcy code a plan of reorganization would resolve among other things the debtors prepetition obligations set forth the revised capital structure of the newly reorganized entity and provide for its corporate governance subsequent to exit from bankruptcy the timing of filing a plan of reorganization by the company will depend on the timing and outcome of numerous other ongoing matters in the chapter 11 cases although the company expects to file a plan of reorganization that provides for its emergence from bankruptcy as a going concern there can be no assurance at this time that a plan of reorganization will be confirmed by the bankruptcy court or that any such plan will be implemented successfully   under section 362 of the bankruptcy code the filing of a bankruptcy petition automatically stays most actions against a debtor including most actions to collect prepetition indebtedness or to exercise control over the property of the debtors estate absent an order of the bankruptcy court substantially all prepetition liabilities are subject to settlement under the plan of reorganization notwithstanding the foregoing the debtors rights to possess and operate certain qualifying aircraft aircraft engines and other aircraftrelated equipment that are leased or subject to a security interest or conditional sale contract are governed by section 1110 of the bankruptcy code section 1110 that specifies different treatment for further information on section 1110 and its impact on the company see properties  flight equipment under item 2 and note 1 proceedings under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in the notes to consolidated financial statements   under section 365 of the bankruptcy code the debtors may assume assume and assign or reject certain executory contracts and unexpired leases including leases of real property aircraft and aircraft engines subject to the approval of the bankruptcy court and certain other conditions in general rejection of an unexpired lease or executory contract is treated as a prepetition breach of the lease or contract in question subject to certain exceptions this rejection relieves the debtors of performing their future obligations under that lease or contract but entitles the lessor or contract counterparty to a prepetition general unsecured claim for damages caused by the deemed breach section 1113c of the bankruptcy code specified particular treatment of collective bargaining agreements cbas which a debtor may move to reject if the debtor first satisfies a number of statutorily prescribed substantive and procedural prerequisites and obtains the bankruptcy courts approval of the rejection see employees  labor matters under item 1 and labor agreements below for further information   at this time it is not possible to predict accurately the effect of the chapter 11 reorganization process on the companys business or when it may emerge from chapter 11 the companys future results depend on the timely and successful confirmation and implementation of a plan of reorganization the rights and claims of various creditors and security holders will be determined by the plan as well no assurance can be given as to what values if any will be ascribed in the bankruptcy proceedings to each of these constituencies and it is possible that uals equity or other securities will be restructured in a manner that will reduce substantially or eliminate any remaining value accordingly the company urges that appropriate caution be exercised with respect to existing and future investments in any of such securities and claims   on february 24 2003 the bankruptcy court entered a preliminary injunction in order to restrict the trading of the companys common stock and debt interests in the company the purpose of the preliminary injunction was to ensure that the company did not lose the benefit of its net operating loss nol under federal and state income tax law an nol can be used to offset future taxable income and thus is an extremely valuable asset however a company can lose the benefit of its nols if the company is deemed to undergo an ownership change under certain very specific tax rules in the internal revenue code excessive trading in a companys stock or debt when the company is in bankruptcy can trigger such an ownership change and thus the company sought to restrict the trading of the companys common stock and debt interests   under the terms of the preliminary injunction no person can buy or sell ual stock if that person holds more than 48 million shares of ual common stock or would hold more than 48 million shares after the purchase any person who holds more than 200 million in debt claims against ual must register as a substantial claimholder with ual and no person may acquire debt claims against ual if the acquisition of the claims would cause them to hold more than 200 million in such claims see note 7 income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements    the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with sop 907 and on a goingconcern basis which contemplates continuity of operations realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business however as a result of the debtors chapter 11 filing such realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities without substantial adjustments or changes in ownership are subject to uncertainty while operating as debtorsinpossession under the protection of chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code and subject to approval of the bankruptcy court or otherwise as permitted in the ordinary course of business the debtors may sell or otherwise dispose of assets or liquidate and settle liabilities for some amounts other than those reflected in the consolidated financial statements further a plan of reorganization could materially change the amounts and classifications in the historical financial statements results of operations summary of results    the air travel business is subject to seasonal fluctuations uniteds operations are often adversely impacted by winter weather and uniteds first and fourthquarter results normally reflect reduced travel demand historically operating results are better in the second and third quarters the events of september 11 and the downturn in the us economy distorted the normal seasonal relationships in 2001 and 2002 as a result of the us war with iraq the typical seasonal fluctuations may continue to be disrupted in 2003   during 2000 the company experienced significant operational disruptions as a result of laborrelated delays and cancellations as well as weather and air traffic control limitations which adversely affected both revenue and expense performance the company attempted to mitigate the impact of these operational difficulties by reducing capacity particularly in the domestic markets where most of the problems were concentrated the company estimated the revenue shortfall arising from these disruptions and associated schedule reductions and cancellations to be somewhere between 700 and 750 million for the year   additionally beginning in early 2001 the weakening us economy had a significant impact on the airline industry as corporations reduced their business travel budgets and changed their travel behavior during the first six months of 2001 the industry began experiencing significant revenue declines as a result of the decrease in business traffic which impacted both unit revenues and yields particularly in the domestic markets uniteds domestic passenger revenue was down 728 million 12 in the first six months of 2001 compared to the same period in 2000 partially driven from a 4 domestic capacity reduction and a 15 decline in business revenues domestic unit revenue was down 8 from 2000 domestic business revenue was down 631 million 15 in the first six months of 2001 driven by a 13 decline in volume and a 2 decline in yield   historically there has been a strong correlation between airline revenues and gdp and corporate profitability as corporate profitability dropped during this period companies reduced spending on travel during this period approximately 65 to 75 of uniteds domestic revenues were derived from business travelers which resulted in united being disproportionately affected by this decline as compared to some of uniteds competitors who rely less heavily on business travelers   the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 had a significant negative impact on passenger and cargo demand for air travel in a direct response to the adverse impact on air travel as a result of the terrorist attacks united reduced its capacity by 23 based on systemwide available seat miles compared to levels prior to september 11 this schedule reduction allowed for the early retirement of the entire b727200 and b737200 fleets in 2001 additionally united began the process of furloughing approximately 20000 employees during the fourth quarter 2001 united restructured its aircraft delivery program with both the boeing company and airbus industrie to defer deliveries of new aircraft for 2002 and 2003 from the 67 originally planned to 24 aircraft united took delivery of 24 of an original 49 aircraft scheduled for the year 2002 and will not take delivery of any of the 18 aircraft originally scheduled for 2003 the remaining 43 aircraft have been deferred into 2004 and beyond uniteds future schedule will vary as the company reacts to continuing changes in demand and yields as well as normal factors such as seasonality and fleet composition   as part of the air transportation safety and system stabilization act of 2001 the act enacted in response to the events of september 11 2001 the federal government made 50 billion in federal grants available to the

as increases to pension and postretirement expense aircraft fuel decreased 555 million 22 on a 14 decrease in consumption and a 10 decrease in fuel price purchased services decreased 239 million 15 primarily as a result of volumedriven decreases in gds global distribution systems and credit card discount fees depreciation and amortization decreased 66 million 6 primarily due to retirements of older aircraft aircraft maintenance decreased 141 million 20 due to retirements of older aircraft and a decrease in engine and aircraft repair volumes as a result of reduced flying commissions

15 points to 708 the following analysis by market is based on information reported to the dot      cargo revenues decreased 227 million 24 due to a 24 decrease in cargo ton miles largely as a result of the september 11 terrorist attacks as well as the discontinuation of freighter operations in the fourth quarter 2000 other operating revenues grew 157 million 11 primarily due to a 161 million

the extent that they relate to future events or expectations may be significantly affected by the chapter 11 cases those proceedings will involve or may result in various restrictions on the companys activities limitations on financing the need to obtain bankruptcy court and creditors committee approval for various matters and uncertainty as to relationships with vendors suppliers customers and others with whom the company may conduct or seek to conduct business   generally under the bankruptcy code most of a debtors liabilities must be satisfied in full before the debtors stockholders can receive any distribution on account of such shares the rights and claims of the companys various creditors and security holders will be determined by any plan of reorganization filed by ual further it is also likely that prepetition unsecured claims against the company will be substantially impaired in connection with the companys reorganization no assurance can be given as to what values if any will be ascribed in the bankruptcy proceedings to each of these constituencies and it is possible that uals equity or other securities will be restructured in a manner that will reduce substantially or eliminate any remaining value liquidity    uals total of cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments including restricted cash both short and longterm was 19 billion at december 31 2002 compared to 26 billion at december 31 2001 cash flows used in operations amounted to 11 billion including the receipt of 130 million in government grant money   property additions including aircraft

during the year   financing activities during 2002 included principal payments under debt and capital lease obligations of 13 billion and 220 million respectively during 2002 united closed on a 775 million private debt financing which refinanced certain aircraft and raised approximately 250 million in additional cash united also arranged longterm financing for approximately 314 million in debt that had been placed in interim financing facilities and refinanced 238 million in longterm debt through a saleleaseback transaction that raised approximately 72 million in additional cash additionally united repaid 133 million in receivablesbacked shortterm borrowings when certain banks supporting the borrowing program declined to renew it in december 2002 united borrowed 700 million under the dip financing   in june 2002 united repaid 34 million to the state of indiana on behalf of the various parties to the agreements for failure to reach its capital targets in connection with the construction of the indianapolis maintenance center in addition in december 2002 the company paid 59 million in retroactive pay plus accrued interest to iamrepresented employees   during 2002 the company received approximately 580 million net in income tax refunds part of which was a result of changes in the tax laws in addition united paid 290 million in federal transportation taxes that had been deferred under the act after the september 11 terrorist attacks   also in 2002 the company received 137 million in proceeds from the sale of its cendant corporation stock and 130 million in compensation under the act in the third quarter of 2002 the company received approximately 113 million in cash which had been held in trust under a services agreement with galileo international now cendant corporation   as of december 31 2002 the company had 578 million in restricted cash including 116 million in longterm restricted cash on deposit with various state and local governments the cash largely represents security for worker compensation obligations in states where united selfinsures security deposits for airport leases and reserves with institutions which process the companys sales prior to 2002 united met many of these obligations through surety bonds or a secured letter of credit facility however many of the bonds have been cancelled and the letter of credit facility expired in august of 2002 as a result united has been and may in the future be required to post additional collateral in the form of cash deposits to support these types of obligations   uniteds liability insurance for losses resulting from war perils terrorism sabotage hijacking and other similar perils was cancelled effective september 26 2001 united obtained replacement coverage although it was charged significantly higher premiums for this replacement coverage which was in a substantially reduced amount for claims not involving aircraft passengers additionally the faa began providing supplemental thirdparty war risk insurance coverage to commercial carriers for renewable 60day periods for levels of coverage not available in the market which united also obtained   in november 2002 congress passed the homeland security act of 2002 which required the faa to provide third party passenger and hull war risk insurance through august 31 2003 this insurance may be extended to december 31 2003 subject to the federal governments determination that such coverage is necessary to the national interest there can be no assurance however that the faa insurance will continue to be available should the faa discontinue this coverage obtaining replacement insurance from commercial underwriters could result in substantially higher premiums and more restrictive terms if it is available at all   united did not make any cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plan trusts for us based employees in 2001 or 2002 in lieu of making cash contributions the company utilized a portion of its credit balance the cumulative difference between prior year minimum required contributions and actual contributions to meet the minimum required contribution the company has a remaining credit balance that is available to be used in 2003 however once the credit balance is fully utilized substantial contributions may be required the company currently estimates based on current market conditions and benefit plans that it could be required to contribute approximately 55 billion to its defined benefit pension plan trusts over the next few years however future funding requirements are dependent upon factors such as interest rate levels funded status regulatory requirements for funding purposes and the level and timing of asset returns as compared with the level and timing of expected benefit disbursements in addition the company is seeking to revise its pension plans as discussed in labor agreements below which would also impact future funding requirements as such it is not possible to be more specific with respect to required contributions and actual future contributions may differ materially as of december 31 2002 uniteds defined benefit pension plans were in compliance with all us government funding requirements   in conjunction with the ratification of the contracts for the iam the company has provided collateral consisting of certain real estate flight simulators ground equipment and spare part assets to support the payment of approximately 520 million in retroactive wages due under the contracts in eight quarterly installments commencing december 2002 in december 2002 the company made the first payment required under the contract and is currently seeking release of the additional collateral   on september 30 2002 ual announced that it was suspending the payment of dividends on its 1225 series b preferred stock and extending the payment of the december 31 distribution on its 1325 trust originated preferred securities toprs to march 31 2003 as a result of its bankruptcy filing ual is no longer making dividend payments on the series b or paying distributions on the toprs   in connection with uals announcement that it was suspending dividend and distribution payments standard  poors sp downgraded uals series b preferred stock and toprs to d from cc as a result of the bankruptcy filing sp downgraded uniteds senior unsecured debt

preferred securities from ca to c downgrades of the companys credit ratings during 2002 have resulted in an increase of 2 million in interest expense for the year   at december 31 2002 commitments for the purchase of property and equipment principally aircraft approximated 16 billion after deducting advance payments of this amount an estimated 01 billion is expected to be spent in 2003 for further details see note 21 commitments contingent liabilities and uncertainties in the notes to consolidated financial statements  capital commitments    the companys business is very capital intensive requiring significant amounts of capital to fund the acquisition of assets particularly aircraft united has in the past funded the acquisition of aircraft through outright purchase by issuing debt or by entering into capital or operating leases similarly the company often enters into longterm lease commitments with airports to ensure access to terminal cargo maintenance and other similar facilities as can be seen in the table below these operating lease commitments which are sometimes referred to as offbalance sheet debt are significant   following is a summary of the companys material contractual cash obligations as of december 31 2002      as a result of the bankruptcy filing the company is not permitted to make any payments on its prepetition debt and therefore the amounts have been excluded from the above table in addition as discussed in note 1 proceedings under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code and note 13 lease obligations in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company may assume assume and assign or reject certain executory contracts and unexpired leases pursuant to the bankruptcy code as a result the company anticipates that its lease obligations as currently detailed in the above table will change significantly in the future   the pension obligations as of december 31 2002 are based on the companys current pension assumptions and current labor contracts thus they assume no permanent wage concessions are achieved nor any changes to the companys pension benefit plans are implemented and that no waivers have been obtained from the government to spread the minimum cash contributions for pensions over a longer period if these changes are effected in the future the companys pension funding obligations could be reduced by approximately 19 billion over this same period   see note 12 longterm debt note 13 lease obligations note 20 pension and postretirement plans and note 21 commitments contingent liabilities and uncertainties in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these items capital resources    dip financing the dip financing consists of two facilities the bank one facility for 300 million and the club facility for 12 billion the company has received commitments of 10 billion under the club facility following the completion of the syndication process for that facility the balance is conditioned upon the participation of one or more additional lenders subject to approval by the existing participants   the bank one facility consists of a 300 million term loan with an interest rate option of the prime rate plus 55 or libor plus 65 with a libor floor of 3 as of december 31 2002 the company had borrowed 300 million at the libor option which is due in five equal monthly installments beginning in march 2004   the club facility consists of a revolving credit and letter of credit facility of 800 million and a term loan of 400 million which matures on july 1 2004 the company has the option of borrowing under the club facility at an interest rate of the prime rate plus 55 or libor plus 65 with a libor floor of 3 as of december 31 2002 the company had borrowed 400 million under the term loan at the libor option in addition the company had available a 100 million letter of credit facility that was drawn down in march 2003 the remaining 700 million under the revolving credit facility is subject to stringent availability hurdles as discussed below   the terms of the dip financing include covenants that require the company to satisfy monthly ongoing financial requirements as determined by ebitdar earnings before interest income taxes depreciation amortization and aircraft rents and covenants that limit among other things the debtors ability to borrow additional money make capital expenditures and make additional corporate investments in addition the company is required to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash balance excluding escrowed amounts of 300 million   under the club facility borrowing availability is determined by a formula based on a percentage of eligible assets the eligible assets consist of certain previously unencumbered aircraft spare engines spare parts inventory certain flight simulators and quick engine change kits the underlying value of such assets may fluctuate periodically due to prevailing market conditions and fluctuations in value may have an impact on the borrowing availability under the club facility availability may be further limited by additional reserves imposed by the banks in their commercially reasonable discretion   the remaining 700 million of availability under the club facility subject to the limitation on borrowing availability discussed above will be available to the company after certain conditions are met including achieving positive cumulative ebitdar submitting a certified updated business plan providing updated appraisals on the collateral and ascertaining there has been no material adverse change with respect to transferability of routes gate leaseholds or slots other information plan for transformation    during the first quarter of 2003 the company presented to its board of directors and employees information regarding the plan for transformation the plan which outlines the fundamental changes to uniteds strategic direction the plan which the company is working to refine through further collaboration with its employee and creditor constituencies seeks to develop a durable and sustainable business model that will lay the foundation for a company that is successful and competitive for the long run   core objectives of the plan are the reduction of uniteds labor and nonlabor costs and the development of a more comprehensive and compelling portfolio of products the plan is intended to leverage uniteds strengths including its industryleading global route network substantial wellsituated hubs and large and loyal customer base including its mileage plus frequent flyer program key operational elements of the plan include 1 the preservation and enhancement of uniteds extensive mainline service targeted primarily at the business traveler 2 the creation of a lowcost offering to compete directly with lowcost carriers for leisure and pricesensitive travelers 3 the growth of the companys united express regional operations and 4 the expansion of uniteds domestic and international alliances   through the plan the company must reduce costs and develop a business model that builds credibility with the financial and investment community to ensure that united has access to capital to emerge from chapter 11 create clear and compelling value for customers maintain and build on uniteds strong global network by creating a competitive portfolio of products that allows united to continue to serve our core business customer yet offers additional value to costconscious fliers and addresses the threat from lowcost carriers and deliver value to employees in a fundamentally changed industry environment the company has already began making cost reductions through a comprehensive restructuring program that includes reducing union labor costs through interim wage reductions as discussed below in labor agreements reducing salaried and management costs by 250 million in 2003 through wage reductions implemented in december 2002 headcount reductions effective january 2003 and proposed benefit changes identifying business transformation initiatives that involve strategic projects such as the us airways code share and a systematic cost reduction program to increase revenues and lower costs by over 1 billion in 2003 and 14 billion in 2004 renegotiating aircraft lease and mortgage agreements for approximately 500 million in estimated savings by 2005 and reducing capacity by 6 in 2003 and closing all us city ticket offices and certain reservation call centers additionally in 2003 the company has implemented an additional acrosstheboard reduction to cut costs by targeting such areas as overhead staffing food and beverage costs and technology spending the company has also begun a best practices program designed to examine every area of the company and implement more efficient practices this program is expected to result in an additional 400 million in cost reductions by 2005 labor agreements    in order to meet the ebitdar covenant under the dip financing united needed to obtain substantial labor savings from its employees by midfebruary 2003 therefore the company imposed immediate wage reductions of between 3 and 11 on its management and salaried employees including officers in december 2002 additionally united immediately began negotiations with all of its unions in early december regarding the changes to the companys cbas necessary to satisfy uniteds shortterm and longterm financial and business imperatives the companys proposed changes to its cbas involve targeted cost savings of 256 billion annually on a cash basis compared to the current contractual path these cost savings are expected to be realized through wage rate reductions work rule modifications and reduced benefit levels   in the event the parties cannot reach consensual modifications section 1113c of the bankruptcy code permits the company to move to reject its cbas under section 1113c the company must satisfy several statutorily prescribed substantive and procedural prerequisites before the bankruptcy court will authorize the company to reject its cbas in order to meet the deadline for reducing its labor costs and avoid being in default under the terms of the dip financing united had been prepared to file a motion to reject its cbas pursuant to section 1113c of the bankruptcy code by december 26 2002 if consensual cba modifications could not be reached before that date   as the december 26 deadline neared however united and several of its unions agreed to consensual interim wage relief from its unions that would allow united and its unions more time to continue negotiations to reach agreements on the cba modifications necessary for united to successfully reorganize while still meeting the shortterm financial imperatives established by the dip covenants in the meantime united reached agreements with four of its five unions to reduce wages on an interim basis effective january 1 2003 to april 30 2003 resulting in a reduction to wages for alparepresented employees of 29 afarepresented employees of 9 and pafca and twurepresented employees of 13 the leadership of the iam rejected the companys proposal and therefore on december 27 2002 united filed a motion with the bankruptcy court to impose a 13 wage reduction for the iamrepresented employees on january 10 2003 the bankruptcy court granted the companys motion and the company effectively reduced iamrepresented employee wages by 13 14 from wages earned after january 10 2003 these wage reductions combined with the wage reductions for the companys salaried and management employees are expected to result in cost savings of approximately 70 million per month through april 2003   under the terms of the interim agreements with its unions and the relief granted by the bankruptcy court against the iam united agreed not to file a motion to reject its cbas pursuant to section 1113c before march 15 2003 in the meantime united and its unions continued negotiations the companys dip covenants however still require united to obtain all of the relief sought in its proposed cba modifications by may 1 2003 as a result on march 17 2003 united filed a motion to reject its cbas pursuant to section 1113c and the bankruptcy court has scheduled hearings on this motions for april 14 march 17 was the deadline by which such a motion needed to be filed to ensure that the company could obtain a ruling on its motion by early may 2003 and stay in compliance with its dip financing covenants without the full relief sought by uniteds proposed cba modifications becoming effective by early may the company would be unable to meet its covenants entitling its dip lenders to foreclose on substantial assets united needs to operate its business   on march 26 2003 the company reached a tentative agreement with the air line pilots association on a restructured cba the agreement which will become effective may 1 2003 if ratified by the pilot membership has a 6year duration includes provisions for a 30 pay cut with15 increases on may 1 2006 2007 2008 and april 30 2009 and common pay rates for three groupings of aircraft b747400 and b777 paid at the b777 rate b767 and b757 paid at a blended rate and a319320 and b737 300500 paid at the b737 rate the pilot defined benefit plan multiplier is reduced to 135 and the participation credit is capped at 30 years the companys contribution to the pilot defined contribution plan is reduced from 11 to 9 pilot health benefits will be adjusted to incorporate mainstream benefit provisions and form the basis for a common plan among all employees with a 20 copay   the agreement provides for flexibility with respect to regional jets domestic and international code share cargo and targeted lowcost operations the contract no longer contains a prohibition on furlough or a requirement to maintain a minimum fleet or level of pilot staffing instead the agreement provides for the establishment of a single block hours commitment at the time of emergence from bankruptcy   as a part of the restructured cba united pilots will participate in a twopart successsharing program including an annual incentive plan that aligns the interests of management and other employees and a pretax profitsharing plan that recognizes the pilots level of participation in the overall restructuring in addition the pilot group will have a representative on the ual board of directors with ordinary voting power the pilots additionally will receive equity securities or other consideration under the plan of reorganization that fairly reflects the value of the pilot contribution to the reorganization of the company us airways code share    on july 24 2002 the company announced a code share agreement with us airways the agreement which is expected to generate more than 200 million in annual revenue for united would allow both carriers to market service on each others network providing significant consumer benefits and bringing new revenue and customers to their route networks   united and us airways customers have access to each carriers airport clubs and they are able to earn and redeem miles on each carriers frequent flyer program additionally beginning january 28 2003 the two carriers began to code share on selected flights and expect to complete implementation of the code sharing arrangement by the end of 2003 foreign operations    united generates revenues and incurs expenses in numerous foreign currencies these expenses include aircraft leases commissions catering personnel expense advertising and distribution costs customer service expenses and aircraft maintenance changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact operating income through changes in foreign currencydenominated operating revenues and expenses despite the adverse favorable effects a strengthening weakening foreign currency may have on us originating traffic a strengthening weakening of foreign currencies tends to increase decrease reported revenue and operating income because uniteds foreign currencydenominated operating revenue generally exceeds its foreign currencydenominated operating expense for each currency   with a worldwide network and significant sales and marketing efforts in the us as well as every major economic region in the world united is able to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in any single foreign currency the companys biggest net exposures are typically for british pound hong kong dollar euro and japanese yen the table below sets forth the companys exposure to various currencies in 2002      to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on uniteds financial results the company may hedge some of the risk of exchange rate volatility on its anticipated future foreign currency revenues by purchasing put options consisting of japanese yen euro canadian dollars australian dollars and british pounds and selling hong kong dollar forwards to reduce hedging costs the company sells a correlation option in the first five currencies referred to above united also attempts to reduce its exposure to transaction gains and losses by converting excess local currencies generated to us dollars on a timely basis and by entering into currency forward or exchange contracts as a result of the bankruptcy filing all swaps and forwards were terminated by the respective counterparties and the companys ability to enter into new swaps or forwards may be limited in the future as a result of the bankruptcy filing   uniteds foreign operations involve insignificant amounts of physical assets however the company does have sizable intangible assets related to acquisitions of atlantic and latin america route authorities operating authorities in international markets are governed by bilateral aviation agreements between the us and foreign countries changes in us or foreign government aviation policies can lead to the alteration or termination of existing air service agreements that could adversely impact the value of uniteds international route authority significant changes in such policies could also have a material impact on uals operating revenues and results of operations municipal bonds    at december 31 2002 approximately 17 billion in special facilities revenue bonds municipal bonds originally issued on behalf of united to build or improve airportrelated facilities were outstanding the company leases facilities at airports pursuant to lease agreements where municipal bonds funded at least some of its airportrelated projects pursuant to the financing agreements entered into by united in connection with such issuance of municipal bonds the company is required to make payments in amounts sufficient to pay the interest semiannually with principal payable upon maturity   united is not permitted under the bankruptcy code to make payments on unsecured prepetition debt without providing notice to its creditors and receiving the approval of the bankruptcy court as united has been advised its municipal bonds are unsecured or in certain instances partially secured prepetition debt united cannot make payments thereon without first meeting the requirements outlined above accordingly the company has classified all of its municipal bonds as liabilities subject to compromise   section 365 of the bankruptcy code requires that the company timely perform all of its postpetition obligations under unexpired leases of nonresidential real property the company believes that it is in compliance with all payment obligations under its lease agreements relating to those airports where it has municipal bonds outstanding under certain of the airport lease agreements however the company may be considered in default due to the nonpayment of the debt and therefore subject to the default provisions of the lease agreements with the airports possible consequences could include loss of the companys status as a signatory airline resulting in increased rents and landing fees and loss of the companys exclusive space agreement   the company did not make the debt service payments due march 1 2003 of approximately 32 million on its chicago ohare series 1999a bonds and of approximately 10 million on its miamidade series 2000 bonds additionally the company does not intend to make debt service payments or any other payment due on or after april 1 2003 on any of the municipal bond issuances which include those referenced above issued on behalf of the company and relating to domestic airport financings   the company filed a complaint of debtor for declaratory judgment with the bankruptcy court on february 28 2003 and entered into a standstill agreement with the city of chicago to seek clarification of its obligations under the municipal bonds and to protect its rights under its airport lease agreement at chicagos ohare international airport until the bankruptcy court decides the merits of the complaint   on march 21 2003 the company filed other complaints of debtor for declaratory judgment and in connection therewith corresponding motions for temporary restraining order with respect to the municipal bonds issuances relating to the facilities at the denver international airport the new york city  john f kennedy international airport the san francisco international airport and the los angeles international airport each seeking a clarification of the companys obligations under the applicable municipal bonds and the protection of its rights under its underlying airport lease agreements at the applicable airport until the bankruptcy court decides the merits of each of the above complaints on march 27 the bankruptcy court conducted a hearing on this issue at that time the court continued the hearing until march 31 2003 and the parties are attempting to negotiate an order that would protect the companys rights under its leases by requiring the lessors to give additional notice of certain alleged defaults the company is unable to predict what if any action might be taken in the future by either the bondholders or the airport authorities as a result of its failure to pay these obligations as contractually required airport rents and landing fees    united is charged facility rents andor landing fees at every airport at which it operates in recent years many airports have increased or sought to increase rates charged to airlines as a means of compensating for increased demands upon airport revenues airlines have challenged certain of these increases through litigation and in some cases have not been successful however to the extent the limitations on such charges are relaxed or the ability of airlines to challenge such charges is restricted the rates charged by airports may increase substantially management cannot predict either the likelihood or the magnitude of any such increase environmental and legal contingencies    united has been named as a potentially responsible party at certain environmental protection agency or state environmental protection agency epa or state epa cleanup sites which have been designated as superfund sites uniteds alleged proportionate contributions at the sites are minimal however at sites where the epa or state epa have commenced litigation or administrative proceedings potential liability is joint and several additionally united has participated and is participating in remediation actions at certain other sites primarily airports the estimated cost of these actions is accrued when it is determined that it is probable that united is liable environmental regulations and remediation processes are subject to future change and determining the actual cost of remediation will require further investigation and additional progress of the remediation therefore the ultimate disposition cannot be determined at this time however while such cost may vary from uniteds current estimate united believes the difference between its accrued reserve and the ultimate liability will not be material   ual has certain other contingencies resulting from the above environmental actions and other litigation and claims incident to the ordinary course of business management believes after considering a number of factors including but not limited to the views of legal counsel the nature of such contingencies and prior experience that the ultimate disposition of these contingencies is not likely to materially affect uals financial condition operating results or liquidity   as a result of the chapter 11 filing as of the petition date virtually all pending litigation is stayed and absent further order of the bankruptcy court no party subject to certain exceptions may take any action again subject to certain exceptions to recover on prepetition claims against the debtors sunset    in connection with the july 1994 recapitalization certain employees of united were granted an approximate 55 equity and voting interest in ual in exchange for wage concessions and workrule changes in addition the companys stockholders approved an elaborate governance structure as described in item 1 business corporate governance and the esops under the recapitalization the governance structure remained in place and employees maintained 55 of the aggregate voting power until sunset sunset occurred on march 7 2003 resulting in the elimination of the 55 voting power of the employees among other things see note 16 esop preferred stock and note 19 employee stock ownership plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements  as well as item 1 business corporate governance and the esops sunset outstanding income tax claims    the company has income tax refund claims refund against the internal revenue service irs of 126 million resulting from tax overpayments attributable to the six years 1988 to 1993 as well as 262 million resulting from a 2002 net operating loss that has been carried back to and generates a refund for taxes paid in 1998 and 1999 however the us department of justice doj had imposed an administrative freeze that prohibited the irs from remitting any of the 388 million to the company the doj action was in response to the companys bankruptcy filing and was based on alleged claims of the us government that might be subject to setoff against the refund after discussions with the doj the company reached an agreement with the government to lift the freeze and permit the irs to process and remit approximately 365 million of the refund on march 27 2003 the bankruptcy court approved the settlement and the company anticipates receiving the funds shortly critical accounting policies    critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions ual has prepared the accompanying financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions the company has identified the following critical accounting policies utilized in the preparation of these financial statements   accounting for longlived assets the company has approximately 16 billion in operating property and equipment at december 31 2002 in addition to the original cost of these assets their recorded value is impacted by a number of policy elections made by the company including the estimation of useful lives residual values and in 2001 impairment charges   the company records aircraft at acquisition cost upon delivery depreciable life is determined by using economic analysis reviewing existing fleet plans and comparing estimated lives to other airlines operating similar fleets older generation aircraft are assigned lives of 25 years which is consistent with the experience of united and other airlines as aircraft technology has improved useful life has increased thus the company has estimated the lives of new generation aircraft to be 30 years residual values are estimated based on the companys historical experience with regards to the sale of both aircraft and spare parts and are established in conjunction with the estimated useful lives of the aircraft residual values are based on current dollars when the aircraft are acquired and typically reflect asset values that have not reached the end of their physical life both depreciable lives and residual values are revised periodically to recognize changes in the companys fleet plans and changes in conditions   the company recognizes an impairment charge when an assets carrying value exceeds its net undiscounted future cash flows and its fair market value the amount of the charge is the difference between the assets carrying value and fair market value typically management estimates the undiscounted future cash flows for its aircraft fleet with models used by the company in making fleet and scheduling decisions these models utilize the companys projections of passenger yield fuel costs labor costs and other relevant factors for the markets where the specific aircraft will operate   in 2001 the company recorded an impairment charge of 517 million for the b737500 and b747400 aircraft fleets resulting from the anticipated decrease in future cash flows in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 121 accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to be disposed of see note 3 special charges in the notes to consolidated financial statements  in the fourth quarter of 2002 the company evaluated its fleet in accordance with sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets utilizing the companys current cash flow projections based on the proposed cba modifications and other cost savings as discussed above in plan for transformation and labor agreements and current appraisals of aircraft value management determined that no further impairment was necessary   see note 2f summary of significant accounting policies  operating property and equipment in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding uniteds policies on accounting for longlived assets   frequent flyer accounting uniteds mileage plus frequent flyer program awards miles to passengers who fly on united united express the star alliance carriers and certain other airlines that participate in the program additionally united sells mileage credits to participating airline partners in the mileage plus program and uls sells mileage credits to nonairline business partners in either case the outstanding miles may be redeemed for travel on any airline that participates in the program the company has an obligation to provide this future travel therefore for awards to passengers redeeming on united united express or one of the mileage plus partners the company recognizes a liability and corresponding expense for this future obligation for miles sold to third parties a portion of revenue from the sale of mileage is deferred and recognized when the transportation is provided   at december 31 2002 uniteds estimated outstanding number of awards was approximately 105 million as compared with 111 million at the end of the prior year united estimates approximately 86 million of these awards will ultimately be redeemed and accordingly the company has recorded a liability of 717 million which includes the deferred revenue from the sale of miles to program participants the company utilizes a number of estimates in accounting for its mileage plus program that require management judgment   members may not reach the threshold necessary for a free ticket and outstanding miles may not always be redeemed for free travel therefore the company estimates how many miles will never be used and excludes those miles from its estimate of the liability based on historical data the difference between the awards expected to be redeemed and the total awards outstanding arises because 1 some awards will never be redeemed 2 some will be redeemed for nontravel benefits and 3 some will be redeemed on partner carriers the company also estimates the number of miles that will be used per award if actual miles used are more or less than estimated the company must adjust its liability and corresponding expense   when a travel award level is attained the company records a liability for the estimated incremental costs of providing travel based on expected redemptions uniteds incremental costs include the additional costs of providing service to the award recipient such as fuel meals insurance and ticketing costs for what would otherwise be a vacant seat the incremental costs do not include any contribution to overhead or profit a change to these cost estimates could have a significant impact on the companys liability in the year of change as well as in future years   in each of 2002 2001 and 2000 20 million mileage plus travel awards were used on united this number represents the number of awards for which travel was actually provided in 2002 and not the number of seats that were allocated to award travel these awards represented 78 of uniteds total revenue passenger miles in 2002 81 in 2001 and 72 in 2000 passenger preference for saver awards which have inventory controls keeps displacement of revenue passengers at a minimum total miles redeemed for travel on united in 2002 including awards and upgrades represented 59 of the total miles redeemed of which 70 were used for travel within the us and canada in addition to the awards issued for travel on united approximately 24 of the total miles redeemed in 2002 were used for travel on partner airlines   as the company also sells mileage credits to participating airline and nonairline partners a change to either the time period over which the credits are used or the estimate of the number or fair value of tickets could have a significant impact on the companys revenues in the year of change as well as future years additional information regarding the mileage plus frequent flyer program is included in note 2g summary of significant accounting policies  mileage plus awards in the notes to consolidated financial statements    pension benefits the company accounts for pension benefits using sfas no 87 employers accounting for pensions sfas no 87 under sfas no 87 pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods and is generally calculated independent of funding decisions or requirements detailed information regarding the companys pension plans are included in note 20 retirement and postretirement plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the companys future funding requirements are discussed in liquidity and capital resources above   the calculation of pension expense and pension obligations requires the use of a number of assumptions including the assumed discount rate and the expected return on plan assets the fair value of plan assets decreased from 76 billion at december 31 2001 to 63 billion at december 31 2002 lower investment returns higher benefit payments due to recent labor contract amendments and declining discount rates have increased the difference between the plans fair value and accumulated benefit obligations from 13 billion at december 31 2001 to 47 billion at december 31 2002   the company utilized a discount rate of 675 at december 31 2002 compared to 75 at december 31 2001 and 775 at december 31 2000 the discount rate is based on the moodys aa bond index as of december 31 2002 adjusted for the duration of uniteds pension obligations duration is a commonly used measure of interest rate risk that either assumes that yield changes do not change the expected cash flows modified duration or assumes that expected cash flows may change given the fact that the yield changes effective duration since uniteds pension obligations are generally not satisfied in a single lump sum distribution management with assistance from its actuary used the modified duration methodology to determine an acceptable discount rate by matching the expected cash outflows of uniteds pension obligations against available bonds with appropriate maturities   the company assumed an expected rate of return on plan assets of 90 at december 31 2002 compared to 975 used at december 31 2001 and 2000 the expected return on plan assets is based on an evaluation of the historical behavior of the broad financial markets and the companys investment portfolio and taking into consideration input from the plans investment consultant and actuary regarding expected longterm market conditions and investment management performance the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of assets to the following fund types 60 equities 35 fixed income and 5 other with expected longterm rates of return of 11 65 and 13 respectively   the company believes that the longterm asset allocation on average will approximate the targeted allocation and regularly reviews the actual asset allocation to periodically rebalance the investments to the targeted allocation when appropriate pension expense is reduced by the expected return on plan assets which is measured by assuming the marketrelated value of plan assets increases at the expected rate of return the marketrelated value is a calculated value that phases in differences between the expected rate of return and the actual return over a period of five years   actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions under sfas no 87 those gains and losses are not required to be recognized currently as pension expense but instead may be deferred if the unrecognized net gain or loss exceeds 10 of the greater of the projected benefit obligations and the marketrelated value of plan assets the amount outside the 10 corridor is subject to amortization over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees at december 31 2002 the company had unrecognized actuarial losses of 45 billion the recognition of these losses is expected to increase pension expense by approximately 75 million 108 million and 157 million in 2003 2004 and 2005 respectively additionally the company had unrecognized prior service costs from past benefit improvements of 12 billion which will be amortized as a component of pension expense over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees the recognition of these costs is expected to increase pension expense by approximately 91 million in each of 2003 2004 and 2005   valuation allowance for deferred tax assets the company initially recorded a tax valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets in the third quarter of 2002 in recording the valuation allowance management considered whether it was more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets would be realized this analysis included consideration of scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities projected future taxable income carryback potential and tax planning strategies in accordance with sfas no 109 accounting for income taxes at december 31 2002 the company had recorded a tax valuation allowance of 12 billion against its deferred tax assets see also note 7 income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information new accounting pronouncements    in june 2002 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 146 accounting for costs associated with disposal or exit activities sfas no 146 sfas no 146 requires that liabilities for costs associated with exit or disposal activities be recognized when the liabilities are incurred rather than when an entity commits to an exit plan the company adopted sfas no 146 on january 1 2003 the new rules will change the timing of liability and expense recognition related to exit or disposal activities but not the ultimate amount of such expenses   in november 2002 the fasb issued interpretation 45 guarantors accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 45 fin 45 requires a guarantor to recognize at the inception of a guarantee a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee fin 45 also expands the disclosures required to be made by a guarantor about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin 45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified the disclosure requirements are effective immediately and are provided in note 21 commitments contingent liabilities and uncertainties in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company does not expect fin 45 to have a material effect on its results of operations   in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation 46 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 46 fin 46 requires the consolidation of variable interest entities vies as defined fin 46 applies to vies created after january 31 2003 the related disclosure requirements are effective immediately and are provided in note 21 commitments contingent liabilities and uncertainties in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company is still evaluating the impact of fin 46 on its financial statements outlook for 2003    the threat of war with iraq and subsequent initiation of hostilities has resulted in a significant decline in revenues for the first quarter and the immediate future passenger unit revenue for january and february 2003 has declined 6 and 11 respectively as compared to the same months of 2002 and future international bookings in particular have dropped significantly from the same period last year ual currently expects to report an operating loss of approximately 900 million for the first quarter of 2003   uniteds nearterm revenue forecast has deteriorated significantly from recent projections as the threat of war became a reality in recent weeks the company has experienced declines in fuel prices but due to continued volatility in the market place is unable to predict what impact if any the war with iraq will have on fuel prices in the future as fuel is a significant expense to united changes in fuel price could have a significant impact on the companys results of operations   with the initiation of military action between the us and iraq on march 19 the company immediately began the implementation of its contingency plan which involved reducing the schedule by an additional 8 effective april 6 2003 and the implementation of associated reductions in employment levels through placing a portion of its employees on temporary unpaid leave   the company in participation with the ata and other airlines is in discussions with the us government regarding the need for financial relief for the industry although the company will continue to pursue relief from the government and other sources given the uncertain situation further

values at date of grant considers a number of factors to estimate the options present value including the stocks historic volatility calculated using the monthly closing price of common stock over a 91 month period ending february 2002 the estimated average holding period of the option interest rates and the stocks expected dividend yield the assumptions used in the valuation of the options were stock price volatility of 46 holding period of 4 years interest rate of 48 and dividend yield of 0   there is no assurance that the hypothetical present values of stock options presented in the table
